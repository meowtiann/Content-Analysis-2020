ííííby Johann W.  Geothe

ííííTranslated by Anna Swanwick  ( 1808 )

ííííIntroductory Note

ííííJohann Wolfgang von Goethe, the greatest of German men of letters, wasborn at Frankfort-on-the-Main, August 28, 1749. His father was a man ofmeans and position, and he personally supervised the early education of hisson. The young Goethe studied at the universities of Leipsig and Strasburg,and in 1772 entered upon the practise of law at Wetzlar. At the invitation ofKarl August, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, he went in 1775 to live in Weimar,where he held a succession of political offices, becoming the Duke's chiefadviser. From 1786 to 1788 he traveled in Italy, and from 1791 to 1817directed the ducal theater at Weimar. He took part in the wars againstFrance, 1792-3, and in the following year began his friendship with Schiller,which lasted till the latter's death in 1805. In 1806 he married ChristianeVulpius. From about 1794 he devoted himself chiefly to literature, and after alife of extraordinary productiveness died at Weimar, March 22, 1832. Themost important of Goethe's works produced before he went to Weimar werehis tragedy ""Gotz von Berlichingen"" (1773), which first brought him fame, and""The Sorrows of Young Werther,"" a novel which obtained enormouspopularity during the so called ""Sturm und Drang"" period. During the years atWeimar before he knew Schiller he began ""Wilhelm Meister,"" wrote thedramas, ""Iphigenie,"" ""Egmont,"" and ""Torquato Tasso,"" and his ""ReineckeFuchs."" To the period of his friendship with Schiller belong the continuation of""Wilhelm Meister,"" the beautiful idyl of ""Hermann and Dorothea,"" and the""Roman Elegies."" In the last period, between Schiller's death in 1805 and hisown, appeared ""Faust,"" ""Elective Affinities,"" his autobiographical ""Dichtungund Wahrheit"" (""Poetry and Truth""), his ""Italian Journey,"" much scientificwork, and a series of treatises on German Art.Though the foregoing enumeration contains but a selection from the titles ofGoethe's best known writings, it suffices to show the extraordinary fertility andversatility of his genius. Rarely has a man of letters had so full and varied a life,or been capable of so many-sided a development. His political and scientificactivities, though dwarfed in the eyes of our generation by his artisticproduction, yet showed the adaptability of his talent in the most diversedirections, and helped to give him that balance of temper and breadth ofvision in which he has been surpassed by no genius of the ancient or modernworld.

ííííThe greatest and most representative expression of Goethe's powers iswithout doubt to be found in his drama of ""Faust""; but before dealing withGoethe's masterpiece, it is worth while to say something of the history of thestory on which it is founded - the most famous instance of the old andwidespread legend of the man who sold his soul to the devil. The historicalDr. Faust seems to have been a self-called philosopher who traveled aboutGermany in the first half of the sixteenth century, making money by thepractise of magic, fortune-telling, and pretended cures. He died mysteriouslyabout 1540, and a legend soon sprang up that the devil, by whose aid hewrought his wonders, had finally carried him off. In 1587 a life of himappeared, in which are attributed to him many marvelous exploits and inwhich he is held up as an awful warning against the excessive desire forsecular learning and admiration for antique beauty which characterized thehumanist movement of the time. In this aspect the Faust legend is anexpression of early popular Protestantism, and of its antagonism to thescientific and classical tendencies of the Renaissance.While a succession of Faust books were appearing in Germany, the originallife was translated into English and dramatized by Marlowe. English playersbrought Marlowe's work back to Germany, where it was copied by Germanactors, degenerated into spectacular farce, and finally into a puppet show.Through this puppet show Goethe made acquaintance with the legend.By the time that Goethe was twenty, the Faust legend had fascinated hisimagination; for three years before he went to Weimar he had been workingon scattered scenes and bits of dialogue; and though he suspended actualcomposition on it during three distinct periods, it was always to resume, andhe closed his labors upon it only with his life. Thus the period of time betweenhis first experiments and the final touches is more than sixty years. During thisperiod the plans for the structure and the signification of the work inevitablyunderwent profound modifications, and these have naturally affected the unityof the result; but, on the other hand, this long companionship and persistentrecurrence to the task from youth to old age have made it in a unique way therecord of Goethe's personality in all its richness and diversity.The drama was given to the public first as a fragment in 1790; then thecompleted First Part appeared in 1808; and finally the Second Part waspublished in 1833, the year after the author's death. Writing in ""Dichtung undWahrheit"" of the period about 1770, when he was in Strasburg with Herder,Goethe says, ""The significant puppet - play legend . . . echoed and buzzed inmany tones within me. I too had drifted about in all knowledge, and earlyenough had been brought to feel the vanity of it. I too had made all sorts ofexperiments in life, and had always come back more unsatisfied and moretormented. I was now carrying these things, like many others, about with meand delighting myself with them in lonely hours, but without writing anythingdown."" Without going into the details of the experience which underlies thesewords, we can see the beginning of that sympathy with the hero of the oldstory that was the basis of its fascination and that accounted for Goethe'sdeparture from the traditional catastrophe of Faust's damnation.Hungarian March from the ""Damnation of Faust""Op.24 by HectorBerlioz(1803 - 1869).

ííííOf the elements in the finished Faust that are derived from the legend a roughidea may be obtained from the ""Doctor Faustus"" of Marlowe, printed in thepresent volume. As early as 1674 a life of Faust had contained the incident ofthe philosopher's falling in love with a servant - girl; but the developed story ofGretchen is Goethe's own. The other elements added to the plot can be notedby a comparison with Marlowe.

ííííIt need hardly be said that Goethe's ""Faust"" does not derive its greatness fromits conformity to the traditional standards of what a tragedy should be. Hehimself was accustomed to refer to it cynically as a monstrosity, and yet heput himself into it as intensely as Dante put himself into ""The Divine Comedy.""A partial explanation of this apparent contradiction in the author's attitude is tobe found in what has been said of its manner of composition. Goethe began itin his romantic youth, and availed himself recklessly of the supernaturalelements in the legend, with the disregard of reason and plausibilitycharacteristic of the romantic mood. When he returned to it in the beginning ofthe new century his artistic standards has changed, and the supernaturalismcould now be tolerated only by being made symbolic. Thus he makes thecareer of Faust as a whole emblematic of the triumph of the persistent strivingfor the ideal over the temptation to find complete satisfaction in the sense, andprepares the reader for this interpretation by prefixing the ""Prologue inHeaven."" The elaboration of this symbolic element is responsible for suchscenes as the Walpurgis - Night and the Intermezzo scenes full of power andinfinitely suggestive, but destructive of the unity of the play as a tragedy ofhuman life. Yet there remains in this First Part even in its final form much thatis realistic in the best sense, the carousal in Auerbach's cellar, the portrait ofMartha, the Easter - morning walk, the character and fate of Margaret. It issuch elements as these that have appealed to the larger reading public and thathave naturally been emphasized by performance on the stage, and by virtue ofthese alone ""Faust"" may rank as a great drama; but it is the result of Goethe'sbroodings on the mystery of human life, shadowed forth in the symbolic partsand elaborated with still greater complexity and still more far - reachingsuggestiveness - and, it must be added, with deepening obscurity - in theSecond Part, that have given the work its place with ""Job,"" with the""Prometheus Bound,"" with ""The Divine Comedy,"" and with ""Hamlet.""The Tragedy Of Faust - Dedication

ííííYe wavering shapes, again ye do enfold me, As erst upon my troubled sightye stole; Shall I this time attempt to clasp, to hold ye? Still for the fond illusionyearns my soul? Ye press around! Come then, your captive hold me, Asupward from the vapoury mist ye roll; Within my breast youth's throbbingpulse is bounding, Fann'd by the magic breath your march surrounding.Shades fondly loved appear, your train attending, And visions fair of many ablissful day; First - love and friendship their fond accents blending, Like tosome ancient, half - expiring lay; Sorrow revives, her wail of anguish sendingBack o'er life's devious labyrinthine way, And names the dear ones, theywhom Fate bereaving Of life's fair hours, left me behind them grieving.They hear me not my later cadence singing, The souls to whom my earlier laysI sang; Dispersed the throng, their severed flight now winging; Mute are thevoices that responsive rang. For stranger crowds the Orphean lyre nowstringing, E'en their applause is to my heart a pang; Of old who listened to mysong, glad hearted, If yet they live, now wander widely parted.A yearning long unfelt, each impulse swaying, To yon calm spirit - realmuplifts my soul; In faltering cadence, as when Zephyr playing, Fans theAeolian harp, my numbers roll; Tear follows tear, my steadfast heart obeyingThe tender impulse, loses its control; What I possess as from afar I see;Those I have lost become realities to me.

ííííPrologue For The Theatre

ííííManager. Dramatic Poet. Merryman.

ííííManager

ííííYe twain, in trouble and distress True friends whom I so oft have found, Say,for our scheme on German ground, What prospect have we of success? Fainwould I please the public, win their thanks; They live and let live, hence it isbut meet. The posts are now erected, and the planks, And all look forward toa festal treat. Their places taken, they, with eyebrows rais'd, Sit patiently, andfain would be amaz'd. I know the art to hit the public taste, Yet ne'er of failurefelt so keen a dread; True, they are not accustomed to the best, But thenappalling the amount they've read. How make our entertainment striking, new,And yet significant and pleasing too? For to be plain, I love to see the throng,As to our booth the living tide progresses; As wave on wave successive rollsalong, And through heaven's narrow portal forceful presses; Still in broaddaylight, ere the clock strikes four, With blows their way towards the boxthey take; And, as for bread in famine, at the baker's door, For tickets arecontent their necks to break. Such various minds the bard alone can sway,My friend, oh work this miracle to - day!

ííííPoet

ííííOh of the motley throng speak not before me, At whose aspect the Spiritwings its flight! Conceal the surging concourse, I implore thee, Whose vortexdraws us with resistless might. No, to some peaceful heavenly nook restoreme, Where only for the bard blooms pure delight, Where love and friendshipyield their choicest blessing, Our heart's true bliss, with god - like handcaressing.

ííííWhat in the spirit's depths was there created, What shyly there the lip shapedforth in sound; A failure now, with words now fitly mated, In the wild tumultof the hour is drown'd; Full oft the poet's thought for years hath waited Untilat length with perfect form 'tis crowned; What dazzles, for the moment born,must perish; What genuine is posterity will cherish.Merryman

ííííThis cant about posterity I hate; About posterity were I to prate, Who thenthe living would amuse? For they Will have diversion, ay, and 'tis their due. Asprightly fellow's presence at your play, Methinks should also count forsomething too; Whose genial wit the audience still inspires, Knows from theirchangeful mood no angry feeling; A wider circle he desires, To their heart'sdepths more surely thus appealing. To work, then! Give a master - piece, myfriend; Bring Fancy with her choral trains before us, Sense, reason, feeling,passion, but attend! Let folly also swell the tragic chorus.Manager

ííííIn chief, of incident enough prepare! A show they want, they come to gapeand stare. Spin for their eyes abundant occupation, So that the multitude maywondering gaze, You by sheer bulk have won your reputation, The man youare all love to praise. By mass alone can you subdue the masses, Each thenselects in time what suits his bent. Bring much, you something bring for variousclasses, And from the house goes every one content. You give a piece,abroad in pieces send it! 'Tis a ragout - success must needs attend it; 'Tis easyto serve up, as easy to invent. A finish'd whole what boots it to present! Fullsoon the public will in pieces rend it.

ííííPoet

ííííHow mean such handicraft as this you cannot feel! How it revolts the genuineartist's mind! The sorry trash in which these coxcombs deal, Is here approvedon principle, I find.

ííííManager

ííííSuch a reproof disturbs me not a whit! Who on efficient work is bent, Mustchoose the fittest instrument. Consider! 'tis soft wood you have to split; Thinktoo for whom you write, I pray! One comes to while an hour away; One fromthe festive board, a sated guest; Others, more dreaded than the rest, Fromjournal - reading hurry to the play. As to a masquerade, with absent minds,they press, Sheer curiosity their footsteps winging; Ladies display theirpersons and their dress, Actors unpaid their service bringing. What dreamsbeguile you on your poet's height? What puts a full house in a merry mood?More closely view your patrons of the night! The half are cold, the half arerude. One, the play over, craves a game of cards; Another a wild night inwanton joy would spend. Poor fools the muses' fair regards. Why court forsuch a paltry end? I tell you, give them more, still more 'tis all I ask, Thus youwill ne'er stray widely from the goal; Your audience seek to mystify cajole; Tosatisfy them - that's a harder task. What ails thee? art enraptured ordistressed?

ííííPoet

ííííDepart! elsewhere another servant choose What! shall the bard his godlikepower abuse? Man's loftiest right, kind nature's high bequest, For your meanpurpose basely sport away? Whence comes his mastery o'er the humanbreast, Whence o'er the elements his sway, But from the harmony that,gushing from his soul, Draws back into his heart the wondrous whole? Withcareless hand when round her spindle, Nature Winds the interminable threadof life; When 'mid the clash of Being every creature Mingles in harshinextricable strife; Who deals their course unvaried till it falleth, In rhythmicflow to music's measur'd tone? Each solitary note whose genius calleth, Toswell the mighty choir in unison? Who in the raging storm sees passionlow'ring? Or flush of earnest thought in evening's glow? Who every blossom insweet spring - time flowering Along the loved one's path would strow? Who,Nature's green familiar leaves entwining, Wreathe's glory's garland, won onevery field? Makes sure Olympus, heavenly powers combining? Man's mightyspirit, in the bard reveal'd!

ííííMerryman

ííííCome then, employ your lofty inspiration, And carry on the poet's avocation,Just as we carry on a love affair. Two meet by chance, are pleased, theylinger there, Insensibly are link'd, they scarce know how; Fortune seems nowpropitious, adverse now, Then come alternate rapture and despair; And 'tis atrue romance ere one's aware. Just such a drama let us now compose. Plungeboldly into life - its depths disclose! Each lives it, not to many is it known,'Twill interest wheresoever seiz'd and shown; Bright pictures, but obscuretheir meaning: A ray of truth through error gleaming, Thus you the best elixirbrew, To charm mankind, and edify them too. Then youth's fair blossomscrowd to view your play, And wait as on an oracle; while they, The tendersouls, who love the melting mood, Suck from your work their melancholyfood; Now this one, and now that, you deeply stir, Each sees the working ofhis heart laid bare. Their tears, their laughter, you command with ease, Thelofty still they honour, the illusive love. Your finish'd gentlemen you ne'er canplease; A growing mind alone will grateful prove.Poet

ííííThen give me back youth's golden prime, When my own spirit too wasgrowing, When from my heart th' unbidden rhyme Gush'd forth, a fount forever flowing; Then shadowy mist the world conceal'd, And every bud sweetpromise made, Of wonders yet to be reveal'd, As through the vales, withblooms inlaid, Culling a thousand flowers I stray'd. Naught had I, yet a richprofusion! The thirst for truth, joy in each fond illusion. Give me unquell'dthose impulses to prove; Rapture so deep, its ecstasy was pain, The power ofhate, the energy of love, Give me, oh give me back my youth again!Merryman

ííííYouth, my good friend, you certainly require When foes in battle round arepressing, When a fair maid, her heart on fire, Hangs on your neck with fondcaressing, When from afar, the victor's crown, To reach the hard - won goalinciteth; When from the whirling dance, to drown Your sense, the night'scarouse inviteth. But the familiar chords among Boldly to sweep, with gracefulcunning, While to its goal, the verse along Its winding path is sweetly running;This task is yours, old gentlemen, to - day; Nor are you therefore less inreverence held; Age does not make us childish, as folk say, It finds us genuinechildren e'en in eld.

ííííManager

ííííA truce to words, mere empty sound, Let deeds at length appear, my friends!While idle compliments you round, You might achieve some useful ends. Whytalk of the poetic vein? Who hesitates will never know it; If bards ye are, asye maintain, Now let your inspiration show it. To you is known what werequire, Strong drink to sip is our desire; Come, brew me such without delay!To - morrow sees undone, what happens not to - day; Still forward press,nor ever tire! The possible, with steadfast trust, Resolve should be theforelock grasp; Then she will ne'er let go her clasp, And labours on, becauseshe must.

ííííOn German boards, you're well aware, The taste of each may have full sway;Therefore in bringing out your play, Nor scenes nor mechanism spare!Heaven's lamps employ, the greatest and the least, Be lavish of the stellarlights, Water, and fire, and rocky heights, Spare not at all, nor birds, norbeast, Thus let creation's ample sphere Forthwith in this our narrow boothappear, And with considerate speed, through fancy's spell, Journey fromheaven, thence through the world, to hell!

ííííPrologue In Heaven

ííííThe Lord, The Heavenly Hosts. Afterwards Mephistopheles.The three Archangels come forward

ííííRaphael

ííííThe Sun, in ancient guise, competing With brother spheres in rival song, Withthunder - march, his orb completing, Moves his predestin'd course along; Hisaspect to the powers supernal Gives strength, though fathom him none may;Transcending thought, the works eternal Are fair as on the primal day.Gabriel

ííííWith speed, thought baffling, unabating, Earth's splendour whirls in circlingflight; Its Eden - brightness alternating With solemn, awe - inspiring night;Ocean's broad waves in wild commotion, Against the rocks' deep base arehurled; And with the spheres, both rock and ocean Eternally are swiftlywhirled.

ííííMichael

ííííAnd tempests roar in emulation From sea to land, from land to sea, Andraging form, without cessation, A chain of wondrous agency, Full in thethunder's path careering, Flaring the swift destructions play; But, Lord, Thyservants are revering The mild procession of thy day.The Three

ííííThine aspect to the powers supernal Gives strength, though fathom thee nonemay; And all they works, sublime, eternal, Are fair as on the primal day.Mephistopheles

ííííSince thou, O Lord, approachest us once more, And how it fares with us, toask art fain, Since thou hast kindly welcom'd me of yore, Thou see'st me alsonow among thy train. Excuse me, fine harangues I cannot make, Though allthe circle look on me with scorn; My pathos soon thy laughter would awake,Hadst thou the laughing mood not long forsworn. Of suns and worlds Inothing have to say, I see alone mankind's self - torturing pains. The littleworld - god still the self - same stamp retains, And is as wondrous now as onthe primal day. Better he might have fared, poor wight, Hadst thou not givenhim a gleam of heavenly light; Reason, he names it, and doth so Use it, thanbrutes more brutish still to grow. With deference to your grace, he seems tome Like any long - legged grasshopper to be, Which ever flies, and flyingsprings, And in the grass its ancient ditty sings. Would he but always in thegrass repose! In every heap of dung he thrusts his nose.The Lord

ííííHast thou naught else to say/ Is blame In coming here, as ever, thy sole aim?Does nothing on the earth to thee seem right?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííNo, Lord! I find things there, as ever, in sad plight. Men, in their evil days,move my compassion; Such sorry things to plague is nothing worth.The Lord

ííííKnow'st thou my servant, Faust?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííThe doctor?

ííííThe Lord

ííííRight.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííHe serves thee truly in a wondrous fashion. Poor fool! His food and drink arenot of earth. An inward impulse hurries him afar, Himself half conscious of hisfrenzied mood; From heaven claimeth he the fairest star, And from the earthcraves every highest good, And all that's near, and all that's far, Fails to allaythe tumult in his blood.

ííííThe Lord

ííííThough in perplexity he serves me now, I soon will lead him where more lightappears; When buds the sapling, doth the gardener know That flowers andfruit will deck the coming years.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííWhat wilt thou wager? Him thou yet shall lose, If leave to me thou wilt butgive, Gently to lead him as I choose!

ííííThe Lord

ííííSo long as he on earth doth live, So long 'tis not forbidden thee. Man still musterr, while he doth strive.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííI thank you; for not willingly I traffic with the dead, and still aver That youth'splump blooming cheek I very much prefer. I'm not at home to corpses; 'tis myway, Like cats with captive mice to toy and play.The Lord

ííííEnough! 'tis granted thee! Divert This mortal spirit from his primal source;Him, canst thou seize, thy power exert And lead him on thy downwardcourse, Then stand abash'd, when thou perforce must own, A good man in hisdarkest aberration, Of the right path is conscious still.Mephistopheles

íííí'Tis done! Full soon thou'lt see my exultation; As for my bet no fears Ientertain. And if my end I finally should gain, Excuse my triumphing with allmy soul. Dust he shall eat, ay, and with relish take, As did my cousin, therenowned snake.

ííííThe Lord

ííííHere too thou'rt free to act without control; I ne'er have cherished hate forsuch as thee. Of all the spirits who deny, The scoffer is least wearisome tome. Ever too prone is man activity to shirk, In unconditioned rest he fainwould live; Hence this companion purposely I give, Who stirs, excites, andmust, as devil, work. But ye, the genuine sons of heaven, rejoice! In the fullliving beauty still rejoice! May that which works and lives, the ever - growing,In bonds of love enfold you, mercy - fraught, And Seeming's changeful forms,around you flowing, Do ye arrest, in ever - during thought!(Heaven closes, the Archangels disperse.)

ííííMephistopheles (alone)

ííííThe ancient one I like sometimes to see, And not to break with him amalways civil; 'Tis courteous in so great a lord as he, To speak so kindly evento the devil.

ííííA high vaulted narrow Gothic chamber. Faust, restless, seated at his desk.Faust

ííííI have, alas! Philosophy, Medicine, Jurisprudence too, And to my costTheology, With ardent labour, studied through. And here I stand, with all mylore, Poor fool, no wiser than before. Magister, doctor styled, indeed,Already these ten years I lead, Up, down, across, and to and fro, My pupilsby the nose, - and learn, That we in truth can nothing know! That in my heartlike fire doth burn. 'Tis true I've more cunning than all your dull tribe, Magisterand doctor, priest, parson, and scribe; Scruple or doubt comes not to enthrallme, Neither can devil nor hell now appal me Hence also my heart must allpleasure forego! I may not pretend, aught rightly to know, I may not pretend,through teaching, to find A means to improve or convert mankind. Then Ihave neither goods nor treasure, No worldly honour, rank, or pleasure; Nodog in such fashion would longer live! Therefore myself to magic I give, Inhope, through spirit - voice and might, Secrets now veiled to bring to light,That I no more, with aching brow, Need speak of what I nothing know; ThatI the force may recognise That binds creation's inmost energies; Her vitalpowers, her embryo seeds survey, And fling the trade in empty words away.O full - orb'd moon, did but thy rays Their last upon mine anguish gaze!Beside this desk, at dead of night, Oft have I watched to hail thy light: Then,pensive friend! o'er book and scroll, With soothing power, thy radiance stole!In thy dear light, ah, might I climb, Freely, some mountain height sublime,Round mountain caves with spirits ride, In thy mild haze o'er meadows glide,And, purged from knowledge - fumes, renew My spirit, in thy healing dew!Woe's me! still prison'd in the gloom Of this abhorr'd and musty room! Whereheaven's dear light itself doth pass, But dimly through the painted glass!Hemmed in by volumes thick with dust, Worm - eaten, hid 'neath rust andmould, And to the high vault's topmost bound, A smoke - stained papercompassed round; With boxes round thee piled, and glass, And many auseless instrument, With old ancestral lumber blent This is thy world! a world!alas! And dost thou ask why heaves thy heart, With tighten'd pressure in thybreast? Why the dull ache will not depart, By which thy life - pulse isoppress'd? Instead of nature's living sphere, Created for mankind of old,Brute skeletons surround thee here, And dead men's bones in smoke andmould.

ííííUp! Forth into the distant land! Is not this book of mystery By Nostradamus'proper hand, An all - sufficient guide? Thou'lt see The courses of the starsunroll'd; When nature doth her thoughts unfold To thee, thy soul shall rise, andseek Communion high with her to hold, As spirit doth with spirit speak! Vainby dull poring to divine The meaning of each hallow'd sign. Spirits! I feel youhov'ring near; Make answer, if my voice ye hear!(He opens the book and perceives the sign of the Macrocosmos.)Ah! at this spectacle through every sense, What sudden ecstasy of joy isflowing! I feel new rapture, hallow'd and intense, Through every nerve andvein with ardour glowing. Was it a god who character'd this scroll, The tumultin my spirit healing, O'er my sad heart with rapture stealing, And by a mysticimpulse, to my soul, The powers of nature all around revealing. Am I a God?What light intense! In these pure symbols do I see, Nature exert her vitalenergy. Now of the wise man's words I learn the sense;""Unlock'd the spirit - world doth lie, Thy sense is shut, thy heart is dead! Upscholar, lave, with courage high, Thine earthly breast in the morning - red!""(He contemplates the sign.)

ííííHow all things live and work, and ever blending, Weave one vast whole fromBeing's ample range! How powers celestial, rising and descending, Theirgolden buckets ceaseless interchange! Their flight on rapture - breathingpinions winging, From heaven to earth their genial influence bringing, Throughthe wild sphere their chimes melodious ringing!A wondrous show! but ah! a show alone! Where shall I grasp thee, infinitenature, where? Ye breasts, ye fountains of all life, whereon Hang heaven andearth, from which the withered heart For solace yearns, ye still impart Yoursweet and fostering tides - where are ye - where? Ye gush, and must Ilanguish in despair?

íííí(He turns over the leaves of the book impatiently, and perceives the sigh ofthe Earth - spirit.)

ííííHow all unlike the influence of this sign! Earth - spirit, thou to me art nigher,E'en now my strength is rising higher, E'en now I glow as with new wine;Courage I feel, abroad the world to dare, The woe of earth, the bliss of earthto bear, With storms to wrestle, brave the lightning's glare, And mid thecrashing shipwreck not despair.

ííííClouds gather over me The moon conceals her light The lamp is quench'dVapours are rising - Quiv'ring round my head Flash the red beams - Downfrom the vaulted roof A shuddering horror floats, And seizes me! I feel it,spirit, prayer - compell'd, 'tis thou Art hovering near! Unveil thyself! Ha! Howmy heart is riven now! Each sense, with eager palpitation, Is strain'd to catchsome new sensation! I feel my heart surrender'd unto thee! Thou must! Thoumust! Though life should be the fee!

íííí(He seizes the book, and pronounces mysteriously the sign of the spirit. Aruddy flame flashes up; the spirit appears in the flame.)Spirit

ííííWho calls me?

ííííFaust (turning aside) Dreadful shape! Spirit

ííííWith might,

ííííThou hast compelled me to appear, Long hast been sucking at my sphere,And now

ííííFaust

ííííWoe's me! I cannot bear thy sight!

ííííSpirit

ííííTo see me thou dost breathe thine invocation, My voice to hear, to gaze uponmy brow; Me doth thy strong entreaty bow Lo! I am here! - What coweringagitation Grasps thee, the demigod! Where's now the soul's deep cry? Whereis the breast, which in its depths a world conceiv'd And bore and cherished?which, with ecstacy, To rank itself with us, the spirits, heaved? Where artthou, Faust? whose voice I heard resound, Who towards me press'd withenergy profound? Art thou he? Thou, - who by my breath art blighted, Who,in his spirit's depths affrighted, Trembles, a crush'd and writhing worm!Faust

ííííShall I yield, thing of flame, to thee? Faust, and thine equal, I am he!Spirit

ííííIn the currents of life, in action's storm, I float and I wave With billowymotion! Birth and the grave A limitless ocean, A constant weaving Withchange still rife, A restless heaving, A glowing life Thus time's whirring loomunceasing I ply, And weave the life - garment of deity.Faust

ííííThou, restless spirit, dost from end to end O'ersweep the world; how near Ifeel to thee!

ííííSpirit

ííííThou'rt like the spirit, thou dost comprehend, Not me!(Vanishes.)

ííííFaust (deeply moved)

ííííNot thee? Whom then? I, Gods own image! And not rank with thee!(A knock)

ííííOh death! I know it - 'tis my famulus My fairest fortune now escapes! That allthese visionary shapes A soulless groveller should banish thus!(Wagner in his dressing gown and night - cap, a lamp in his hand. Faust turnsround reluctantly.)

ííííWagner

ííííPardon! I heard you here declaim; A Grecian tragedy you doubtless read?Improvement in this art is now my aim, For now - a - days it much avails.Indeed An actor, oft I've heard it said, as teacher, May give instruction to apreacher.

ííííFaust

ííííAy, if your priest should be an actor too, As not improbably may come topass.

ííííWagner

ííííWhen in his study pent the whole year through, Man views the world, asthrough an optic glass, On a chance holiday, and scarcely then, How bypersuasion can he govern men?

ííííFaust

ííííIf feeling prompt not, if it doth not flow Fresh from the spirit's depths, withstrong control Swaying to rapture every listener's soul, Idle your toil; thechase you may forego! Brood o'er your task! Together glue, Cook fromanother's feast your own ragout, Still prosecute your paltry game, And fanyour ash - heaps into flame! Thus children's wonder you'll excite, And apes', ifsuch your appetite; But that which issues from the heart alone, Will bend thehearts of others to your own.

ííííWagner

ííííThe speaker in delivery will find Success alone; I still am far behind.Faust

ííííA worthy object still pursue! Be not a hollow tinkling fool! Soundunderstanding, judgment true, Find utterance without art or rule; And when inearnest you are moved to speak, Then is it needful cunning words to seek?Your fine harangues, so polish'd in their kind, Wherein the shreds of humanthought ye twist, Are unrefreshing as the empty wind, Whistling throughwither'd leaves and autumn mist!

ííííWagner

ííííOh God! How long is art, Our life how short! With earnest zeal Still as I plythe critic's task, I feel A strange oppression both of head and heart. The verymeans how hardly are they won, By which we to the fountains rise! Andhaply, ere one half the course is run, Check'd in his progress, the poor devildies.

ííííFaust

ííííParchment, is that the sacred fount whence roll Waters, he thirsteth not whoonce hath quaffed? Oh, if it gush not from thine inmost soul, Thou has not wonthe life - restoring draught.

ííííWagner

ííííYour pardon! 'tis delightful to transport Oneself into the spirit of the past, Tosee in times before us how a wise man thought, And what a glorious height wehave achieved at last.

ííííFaust

ííííAy truly! even to the loftiest star! To us, my friend, the ages that are pass'd Abook with seven seals, close - fasten'd, are; And what the spirit of the timesmen call, Is merely their own spirit after all, Wherein, distorted oft, the timesare glass'd. Then truly, 'tis a sight to grieve the soul! At the first glance we fly itin dismay; A very lumber - room, a rubbish - hole; At best a sort of mock -heroic play, With saws pragmatical, and maxims sage, To suit the puppetsand their mimic stage.

ííííWagner

ííííBut then the world and man, his heart and brain! Touching these things all menwould something know.

ííííFaust

ííííAy! what 'mong men as knowledge doth obtain! Who on the child its truename dares bestow? The few who somewhat of these things have known,Who their full hearts unguardedly reveal'd, Nor thoughts, nor feelings, fromthe mob conceal'd, Have died on crosses, or in flames been thrown. Excuseme, friend, far now the night is spent, For this time we must say adieu.Wagner

ííííStill to watch on I had been well content, Thus to converse so learnedly withyou. But as to - morrow will be Easter - day, Some further questions grant, Ipray; With diligence to study still I fondly cling; Already I know much, butwould know everything.

íííí(Exit.)

ííííFaust Soliloquy - Chorus Of Angels

ííííFaust (alone)

ííííHow him alone all hope abandons never, To empty trash who clings, with zealuntired, With greed for treasure gropes, and, joy - inspir'd, Exults if earth -worms second his endeavour.

ííííAnd dare a voice of merely human birth, E'en here, where shapes immortalthrong'd intrude? Yet ah! thou poorest of the sons of earth, For once, I e'ento thee feel gratitude. Despair the power of sense did well - nigh blast, Andthou didst save me ere I sank dismay'd, So giant - like the vision seem'd, sovast, I felt myself shrink dwarf'd as I survey'd!I, God's own image, from this toil of clay Already freed, with eager joy whohail'd The mirror of eternal truth unveil'd, Mid light effulgent and celestial day:I, more than cherub, whose unfetter'd soul With penetrative glance aspir'd toflow Through nature's veins, and, still creating, know The life of gods, - howam I punish'd now! One thunder - word hath hurl'd me from the goal!Spirit! I dare not lift me to thy sphere. What though my power compell'd theeto appear, My art was powerless to detain thee here. In that great moment,rapture - fraught, I felt myself so small, so great; Fiercely didst thrust me fromthe realm of thought Back on humanity's uncertain fate! Who'll teach me now?What ought I to forego? Ought I that impulse to obey? Alas! our every deed,as well as every woe, Impedes the tenor of life's onward way!E'en to the noblest by the soul conceiv'd, Some feelings cling of baser quality;And when the goods of this world are achiev'd, Each nobler aim is termed acheat, a lie. Our aspirations, our soul's genuine life, Grow torpid in the din ofearthly strife. Though youthful phantasy, while hope inspires, Stretch o'er theinfinite her wing sublime, A narrow compass limits her desires, When wreck'dour fortunes in the gulf of time. In the deep heart of man care builds her nest,O'er secret woes she broodeth there, Sleepless she rocks herself and scarethjoy and rest; Still is she wont some new disguise to wear, She may as houseand court, as wife and child appear, As dagger, poison, fire and flood;Imagined evils chill thy blood,

ííííAnd what thou ne'er shall lose, o'er that dost shed the tear. I am not like thegods! Feel it I must; I'm like the earth - worm, writhing in the dust, Which, ason dust it feeds, its native fare, Crushed 'neath the passer's tread, lies buriedthere.

ííííIs it not dust, wherewith this lofty wall, With hundred shelves, confines meround; Rubbish, in thousand shapes, may I not call What in this moth - worlddoth my being bound? Here, what doth fail me, shall I find? Read in athousand tomes that, everywhere, Self - torture is the lot of human - kind,With but one mortal happy, here and there? Thou hollow skull, that grin, whatshould it say, But that thy brain, like mine, of old perplexed, Still yearning forthe truth, hath sought the light of day. And in the twilight wandered, sorelyvexed? Ye instruments, forsooth, ye mock at me, With wheel, and cog, andring, and cylinder; To nature's portals ye should be the key; Cunning yourwards, and yet the bolts ye fail to stir. Inscrutable in broadest light, To beunveil'd by force she doth refuse, What she reveals not to thy mental sight,Thou wilt not wrest me from her with levers and with screws. Old uselessfurnitures, yet stand ye here, Because my sire ye served, now dead and gone.Old scroll, the smoke of years dost wear, So long as o'er this desk the sorrylamp hath shone. Better my little means hath squandered quite away, Thanburden'd by that little here to sweat and groan! Wouldst thou possess thyheritage, essay, By use to render it thine own! What we employ not, butimpedes our way, That which the hour creates, that can it use alone! Butwherefore to yon spot is riveted my gaze? Is yonder flasket there a magnet tomy sight? Whence this mild radiance that around me plays, As when, 'midforest gloom, reigneth the moon's soft light?

ííííHail precious phial! Thee, with reverent awe, Down from thine old receptacleI draw! Science in thee I hail and human art. Essence of deadliest powers,refin'd and sure, Of soothing anodynes abstraction pure, Now in thy master'sneed thy grace impart! I gaze on thee, my pain is lull'd to rest; I grasp thee,calm'd the tumult in my breast; The flood - tide of my spirit ebbs away;Onward I'm summon'd o'er a boundless main, Calm at my feet expands theglassy plain, To shores unknown allures a brighter day.Lo, where a car of fire, on airy pinion, Comes floating towards me! I'mprepar'd to fly By a new track through ether's wide dominion, To distantspheres of pure activity. This life intense, this godlike ecstasy Worm that thouart such rapture canst thou earn? Only resolve with courage stern and high,Thy visage from the radiant sun to turn! Dare with determin'd will to burst theportals Past which in terror others fain would steal! Now is the time, throughdeeds, to show that mortals The calm sublimity of gods can feel; To shuddernot at yonder dark abyss, Where phantasy creates her own self - torturingbrood, Right onward to the yawning gulf to press, Around whose narrowjaws rolleth hell's fiery flood; With glad resolve to take the fatal leap, Thoughdanger threaten thee, to sink in endless sleep! Pure crystal goblet! forth Idraw thee now, From out thine antiquated case, where thou Forgotten hastreposed for many a year! Oft at my father's revels thou didst shine, To gladthe earnest guests was thine, As each to other passed the generous cheer. Thegorgeous brede of figures, quaintly wrought, Which he who quaff'd must firstin rhyme expound, Then drain the goblet at one draught profound, Hath nightsof boyhood to fond memory brought. I to my neighbour shall not reach theenow, Nor on thy rich device shall I my cunning show. Here is a juice, makesdrunk without delay; Its dark brown flood thy crystal round doth fill; Let thislast draught, the product of my skill, My own free choice, be quaff'd withresolute will, A solemn festive greeting, to the coming day!(He places the goblet to his mouth.)

íííí(The ringing of bells, and choral voices.)

ííííChorus of Angels

ííííChrist is arisen! Mortal, all hail to thee, Thou whom mortality, Earth's sadreality, Held as in prison.

ííííFaust

ííííWhat hum melodious, what clear silvery chime Thus draws the goblet frommy lips away? Ye deep - ton'd bells, do ye with voice sublime, Announce thesolemn dawn of Easter - day? Sweet choir! are ye the hymn of comfortsinging, Which one around the darkness of the grave, From seraph - voices,in glad triumph ringing, Of a new covenant assurance gave?Chorus of Women

ííííWe, his true - hearted, With spices and myrrh, Embalmed the departed, Andswathed him with care; Here we conveyed Him, Our Master, so dear; Alas!Where we laid Him, The Christ is not here,

ííííChorus of Angels

ííííChrist is arisen! Blessed the loving one, Who from earth's trial throes, Healingand strengthening woes, Soars as from prison.

ííííFaust

ííííWherefore, ye tones celestial, sweet and strong, Come ye a dweller in thedust to seek? Ring out your chimes believing crowds among, The messagewell I hear, my faith alone is weak; From faith her darling, miracle, hathsprung. Aloft to yonder spheres I dare not soar, Whence sound the tidings ofgreat joy; And yet, with this sweet strain familiar when a boy, Back it recallethme to life once more. Then would celestial love, with holy kiss, Come o'er mein the Sabbath's stilly hour, While, fraught with solemn meaning andmysterious power, Chim'd the deep - sounding bell, and prayer was bliss; Ayearning impulse, undefin'd yet dear, Drove me to wander on through woodand field; With heaving breast and many a burning tear, I felt with holy joy aworld reveal'd. Gay sports and festive hours proclaim'd with joyous pealing,This Easter hymn in days of old; And fond remembrance now doth me, withchildlike feeling, Back from the last, the solemn step, withhold. O still soundon, thou sweet celestial strain! The tear - drop flows, - Earth, I am thineagain!

ííííChorus of Disciples

ííííHe whom we mourned as dead, Living and glorious, From the dark gravehath fled, O'er death victorious; Almost creative bliss Waits on his growingpowers; Ah! Him on earth we miss; Sorrow and grief are ours. Yearning heleft his own, Mid sore annoy; Ah! we must needs bemoan. Master, thy joy!Chorus of Angels

ííííChrist is arisen, Redeem'd from decay. The bonds which imprison Your souls,rend away! Praising the Lord with zeal, By deeds that love reveal, Likebrethren true and leal Sharing the daily meal, To all that sorrow feelWhisp'ring of heaven's weal, Still is the master near, Still is he here!Before The Gate

ííííTo the hunting - lodge we're on our way.

ííííThe First

ííííWe towards the mill are strolling on.

ííííA Mechanic

ííííA walk to Wasserhof were best.

ííííA Second

ííííThe road is not a pleasant one.

ííííThe Others

ííííWhat will you do?

ííííA Third

ííííI'll join the rest.

ííííA Fourth

ííííLet's up to Burghof, there you'll find good cheer, The prettiest maidens andthe best of beer, And brawls of a prime sort.

ííííA Fifth

ííííYou scapegrace! How; Your skin still itching for a row? Thither I will not go,I loathe the place.

ííííServant Girl

ííííNo, no! I to the town my steps retrace.

ííííAnother

ííííNear yonder poplars he is sure to be.

ííííThe First

ííííAnd if he is, what matters it to me! With you he'll walk, he'll dance with nonebut you, And with your pleasures what have I to do?The Second

ííííTo - day he will not be alone, he said His friend would be with him, the curly -head.

ííííStudent

ííííWhy how those buxom girls step on! Come, brother, we will follow themanon. Strong beer, a damsel smartly dress'd, Stinging tobacco, - these I lovethe best.

ííííBurgher's Daughter

ííííLook at those handsome fellows there! 'Tis really shameful, I declare, Thevery best society they shun, After those servant girls forsooth, to run.Second Student (to the first)

ííííNot quite so fast! for in our rear, Two girls, well - dress'd, are drawing near;Not far from us the one doth dwell, And sooth to say, I like her well. Theywalk demurely, yet you'll see, That they will let us join them presently.The First

ííííNot I! restraints of all kinds I detest. Quick! let us catch the wild - game ere itflies, The hand on Saturday the mop that plies, Will on the Sunday fondle youthe best.

ííííBurgher

ííííNo, this new Burgomaster, I like him not, God knows, Now, he's in office,daily more arrogant he grows; And for the town, what doth he do for it? Arenot things worse from day to day? To more restraints we must submit; Andtaxes more than ever pay.

ííííBeggar (sings)

ííííKind gentleman and ladies fair, So rosy - cheek'd and trimly dress'd, Bepleas'd to listen to my prayer, Relieve and pity the distress'd. Let me notvainly sing my lay! His heart's most glad whose hand is free. Now when allmen keep holiday, Should be a harvest - day to me.Another Burgher

ííííOn holidays and Sundays naught know I more inviting Than chatting aboutwar and war's alarms, When folk in Turkey, up in arms, Far off, are 'gainsteach other fighting. We at the window stand, our glasses drain, And watchadown the stream the painted vessels gliding Then joyful we at eve comehome again, And peaceful times we bless, peace long - abiding.Third Burgher

ííííAy, neighbour! So let matters stand for me! There they may scatter oneanother's brains, And wild confusion round them see So here at home in quietall remains! Old Woman (to the Burghers' Daughters) Heyday! How smart!The fresh young blood! Who would not fall in love with you? Not quite soproud! 'Tis well and good! And what you wish, that I could help you to.Burgher's Daughter

ííííCome, Agatha! I care not to be seen Walking in public with these witches.True, My future lover, last St. Andrew's E'en, In flesh and blood she broughtbefore my view.

ííííAnother

ííííAnd mine she show'd me also in the glass, A soldier's figure, with companionsbold; I look around, I seek him as I pass, In vain, his form I nowhere canbehold.

ííííSoldiers

ííííFortress with turrets And walls high in air, Damsel disdainful, Haughty andfair, There be my prey! Bold is the venture, Costly the pay!Hark how the trumpet Thither doth call us, Where either pleasure Or deathmay befall us. Hail to the tumult! Life's in the field! Damsel and fortress To usmust yield.

ííííBold is the venture, Costly the pay! Gaily the soldier Marches away.Faust and Wagner - Peasant Dances

ííííFaust

ííííLoosed from their fetters are streams and rills Through the gracious spring -tide's all - quickening glow; Hope's budding joy in the vale doth blow; OldWinter back to the savage hills Withdraweth his force, decrepid now. Thenceonly impotent icy grains Scatters he as he wings his flight, Striping with sleetthe verdant plains; But the sun endureth no trace of white; Everywhere growthand movement are rife, All things investing with hues of life: Though flowersare lacking, varied of dye, Their colours the motley throng supply. Turn theearound, and from this height, Back to the town direct thy sight. Forth from thehollow, gloomy gate, Stream forth the masses, in bright array. Gladly seekthey the sun to - day; The Lord's Resurrection they celebrate: For theythemselves have risen, with joy, From tenement sordid, from cheerless room,From bonds of toil, from care and annoy, From gable and roof's o'er -hanging gloom, From crowded alley and narrow street, And from thechurches' awe - breathing night, All now have come forth into the light. Look,only look, on nimble feet, Through garden and field how spread the throng,How o'er the river's ample sheet,

ííííMany a gay wherry glides along; And see, deep sinking in the tide, Pushes thelast boat now away. E'en from yon far hill's path - worn side, Flash the brighthues of garments gay. Hark! Sounds of village mirth arise; This is the people'sparadise. Both great and small send up a cheer; Here am I man, I feel it here.Wagner

ííííSir Doctor, in a walk with you There's honour and instruction too; Yet herealone I care not to resort, Because I coarseness hate of every sort. Thisfiddling, shouting, skittling, I detest; I hate the tumult of the vulgar throng; Theyroar as by the evil one possess'd, And call it pleasure, call it song.Peasants (under the linden - tree)

ííííDance and song

ííííThe shepherd for the dance was dress'd, With ribbon, wreath, and colouredvest, A gallant show displaying. And round about the linden - tree, Theyfooted it right merrily. Juchhe! Juchhe! Juchheisa! Heisa! He! So fiddle - bowwas braying

ííííOur swain amidst the circle press'd, He push'd a maiden trimly dress'd, Andjogg'd her with his elbow; The buxom damsel turn'd her head, ""Now that's astupid trick!"" she said Juchhe! Juchhe! Juchheisa! Heisa! He! Don't be sorude, good fellow!

ííííSwift in the circle they advanced, They danced to right, to left they danced,And all the skirts were swinging. And they grew red, and they grew warm,Panting, they rested arm in arm, Juchhe! Juchhe! Juchheisa! Heisa! He! Tohip their elbow bringing.

ííííDon't make so free! How many a maid Has been betroth'd and then betray'd;And has repented after! Yet still he flatter'd her aside, And from the linden, farand wide, Juchhe! Juchhe! Juchheisa! Heisa! He! Rang fiddle - bow andlaughter.

ííííOld Peasant

ííííDoctor, 'tis really kind of you, To condescend to come this way, A highlylearned man like you, To join our mirthful throng to - day. Our fairest cup Ioffer you, which we with sparkling drink have crown'd, And pledging you, Ipray aloud, That every drop within its round, While it your present thirstallays, May swell the number of your days.

ííííFaust

ííííI take the cup you kindly reach, Thanks and prosperity to each! (The crowdgather round in a circle.)

ííííOld Peasant

ííííAy, truly! 'tis well done, that you Our festive meeting thus attend; You, who inevil days of yore, So often show'd yourself our friend! Full many a one standsliving here, Who from the fever's deadly blast, Your father rescu'd, when hisskill The fatal sickness stay'd at last. A young man then, each house yousought, Where reign'd the mortal pestilence. Corpse after corpse was carriedforth, But still unscath'd you issued thence. Sore then your trials and severe;The Helper yonder aids the helper here.

ííííAll

ííííHeaven bless the trusty friend, and long To help the poor his life prolong!Faust

ííííTo Him above in homage bend, Who prompts the helper and Who help dothsend. (He proceeds with Wagner.)

ííííWagner

ííííWhat feelings, great man, must thy breast inspire, At homage paid thee by thiscrowd! Thrice blest Who from the gifts by him possessed Such benefit candraw! The sire Thee to his boy with reverence shows; They press around,inquire, advance, Hush'd is the fiddle, check'd the dance. Where thou dostpass they stand in rows, And each aloft his bonnet throws, But little fails andthey to thee, As though the Host came by, would bend the knee.Faust

ííííA few steps further, up to yonder stone! Here rest we from our walk. In timeslong past, Absorb'd in thought, here oft I sat alone, And disciplin'd myselfwith prayer and fast. Then rich in hope, with faith sincere, With sighs, andhands in anguish press'd, The end of that sore plague, with many a tear, Fromheaven's dread Lord, I sought to wrest. The crowd's applause assumes ascornful tone. Oh, could'st thou in my inner being read, How little either sireor son, Of such renown deserves the meed! My sire, of good repute, andsombre mood, O'er nature's powers and every mystic zone, With honest zeal,but methods of his own, With toil fantastic loved to brood; His time in darkalchemic cell, With brother adepts he would spend, And there antagonistscompel, Through numberless receipts to blend. A ruddy lion there, a suitorbold, In tepid bath was with the lily wed. Thence both, while open flamesaround them roll'd, Were tortur'd to another bridal bed. Was then the youthfulqueen descried With varied colours in the flask; This was our medicine; thepatients died, ""Who were restored?"" none cared to ask. With our infernalmixture thus, ere long, These hills and peaceful vales among, We rag'd morefiercely than the pest; Myself the deadly poison did to thousands give; Theypined away, I yet must live, To hear the reckless murderers blest.Wagner

ííííWhy let this thought your soul o'ercast? Can man do more than with nice skill,With firm and conscientious will, Practise the art transmitted from the past? Ifthou thy sire dost honour in thy youth, His lore thou gladly wilt receive; Inmanhood, dost thou spread the bounds of truth, Then may thy son a highergoal achieve.

ííííFaust

ííííHow blest, in whom the fond desire From error's sea to rise, hope stillrenews! What a man knows not, that he doth require, And what he knoweth,that he cannot use. But let not moody thoughts their shadow throw O'er thecalm beauty of this hour serene! In the rich sunset see how brightly glow Yoncottage homes, girt round with verdant green! Slow sinks the orb, the day innow no more; Yonder he hastens to diffuse new life. Oh for a pinion from theearth to soar, And after, ever after him to strive! Then should I see the worldbelow, Bathed in the deathless evening - beams, The vales reposing, everyheight a - glow, The silver brooklets meeting golden streams. The savagemountain, with its cavern'd side, Bars not my godlike progress. Lo, the ocean,Its warm bays heaving with a tranquil motion, To my rapt vision opes itsample tide! But now at length the god appears to sink; A new - born impulsewings my flight, Onward I press, his quenchless light to drink, The day beforeme, and behind the night, The pathless waves beneath, and over me the skies.Fair dream, it vanish'd with the parting day! Alas! that when on spirit - wingwe rise, No wing material lifts our mortal clay. But 'tis our inborn impulse,deep and strong, Upwards and onwards still to urge our flight, When farabove us pours its thrilling song The sky - lark, lost in azure light, When onextended wing amain O'er pine - crown'd height the eagle soars, And overmoor and lake, the crane Still striveth towards its native shores.Wagner

ííííTo strange conceits oft I myself must own, But impulse such as this I ne'erhave known: Nor woods, nor fields, can long our thoughts engage, Theirwings I envy not the feather'd kind; Far otherwise the pleasures of the mind,Bear us from book to book, from page to page! Then winter nights growcheerful; keen delight Warms every limb; and ah! when we unroll Some oldand precious parchment, at the sight All heaven itself descends upon the soul.Faust

ííííThy heart by one sole impulse is possess'd; Unconscious of the other stillremain! Two souls, alas! are lodg'd within my breast, Which struggle there forundivided reign: One to the world, with obstinate desire, And closely -cleaving organs, still adheres; Above the mist, the other doth aspire, Withsacred vehemence, to purer spheres. Oh, are there spirits in the air, Who float'twixt heaven and earth dominion wielding, Stoop hither from your goldenatmosphere, Lead me to scenes, new life and fuller yielding! A magic mantledid I but possess, Abroad to waft me as on viewless wings, I'd prize it farbeyond the costliest dress, Nor would I change it for the robe of kings.Alas, two souls are living in my breast, And one wants to separate itself fromthe other. One holds fast to the world with earthy passion And clings withtwining tendrils: The other lifts itself with forceful craving To the very roof ofheaven.

ííííWagner

ííííCall not the spirits who on mischief wait! Their troop familiar, streamingthrough the air, From every quarter threaten man's estate, And danger in athousand forms prepare! They drive impetuous from the frozen north, Withfangs sharp - piercing, and keen arrowy tongues; From the ungenial east theyissue forth, And prey, with parching breath, upon thy lungs; If, waft'd on thedesert's flaming wing, They from the south heap fire upon the brain,Refreshment from the west at first they bring, Anon to drown thyself and fieldand plain. In wait for mischief, they are prompt to hear; With guileful purposeour behests obey; Like ministers of grace they oft appear, And lisp likeangels, to betray. But let us hence! Grey eve doth all things blend, The airgrows chill, the mists descend! 'Tis in the evening first our home we prize Whystand you thus, and gaze with wondering eyes? What in the gloom thus movesyou?

ííííFaust

ííííYon black hound See'st thou, through corn and stubble scampering round?Wagner

ííííI've mark'd him long, naught strange in him I see!Faust

ííííNote him! What takest thou the brute to be?

ííííWagner

ííííBut for a poodle, whom his instinct serves His master's track to find oncemore.

ííííFaust

ííííDost mark how round us, with wide spiral curves, He wheels, each circlecloser than before? And, if I err not, he appears to me A line of fire upon histrack to leave.

ííííWagner

ííííNaught but a poodle black of hue I see; 'Tis some illusion doth your sightdeceive.

ííííFaust

ííííMethinks a magic coil our feet around, He for a future snare doth lightlyspread.

ííííWagner

ííííAround us as in doubt I see him shyly bound, Since he two strangers seeth inhis master's stead.

ííííFaust

ííííThe circle narrows, he's already near!

ííííWagner

ííííA dog dost see, no spectre have we here; He growls, doubts, lays him on hisbelly, too, And wags his tail - as dogs are wont to do.Faust

ííííCome hither, Sirrah! join our company!

ííííWagner

ííííA very poodle, he appears to be! Thou standest still, for thee he'll wait; Thouspeak'st to him, he fawns upon thee straight; Aught thou mayst lose, again he'llbring, And for thy stick will into water spring.Faust

ííííThou'rt right indeed; no traces now I see Whatever of a spirit's agency. 'Tistraining - nothing more.

ííííWagner

ííííA dog well taught E'en by the wisest of us may be sought. Ay, to your favourhe's entitled too, Apt scholar of the students, 'tis his due! (They enter the gateof the town.)

ííííFaust Meets With Mephistopheles

ííííStudy

ííííFaust (entering with the poodle)

ííííNow field and meadow I've forsaken; O'er them deep night her veil dothdraw; In us the better soul doth waken, With feelings of foreboding awe, Alllawless promptings, deeds unholy, Now slumber, and all wild desires; Thelove of man doth sway us wholly, And love to God the soul inspires.Peace, poodle, peace! Scamper not thus; obey me! Why at the thresholdsnuffest thou so? Behind the stove now quietly lay thee, My softest cushion tothee I'll throw. As thou, without, didst please and amuse me Running andfrisking about on the hill, So tendance now I will not refuse thee; A welcomeguest, if thou'lt be still.

ííííAh! when the friendly taper gloweth, Once more within our narrow cell, Thenin the heart itself that knoweth, A light the darkness doth dispel. Reason hervoice resumes; returneth Hope's gracious bloom, with promise rife; Forstreams of life the spirit yearneth, Ah! for the very fount of life.Poodle, snarl not! with the tone that arises, Hallow'd and peaceful, my soulwithin, Accords not thy growl, thy bestial din. We find it not strange, that mandespises What he conceives not; That he the good and fair misprizes Findingthem often beyond his ken; Will the dog snarl at them like men?But ah! Despite my will, it stands confessed, Contentment welleth up nolonger in my breast. Yet wherefore must the stream, alas, so soon be dry,That we once more athirst should lie? Full oft this sad experience hath beenmine; Nathless the want admits of compensation; For things above the earthwe learn to pine, Our spirits yearn for revelation, Which nowhere burns withpurer beauty blent, Than here in the New Testament. To ope the ancient textan impulse strong Impels me, and its sacred lore, With honest purpose toexplore, And render into my love German tongue.(He opens a volume, and applies himself to it.)'Tis writ, ""In the beginning was the Word!"" I pause, perplex'd! Who now willhelp afford? I cannot the mere Word so highly prize; I must translate itotherwise, If by the spirit guided as I read. ""In the beginning was the Sense!""Take heed, The import of this primal sentence weigh, Lest thy too hasty penbe led astray! Is force creative then of Sense the dower? ""In the beginningwas the Power!"" Thus should it stand: yet, while the line I trace, A somethingwarns me, once more to efface. The spirit aids! from anxious scruples freed, Iwrite, ""In the beginning was the Deed!""

ííííAm I with thee my room to share, Poodle, thy barking now forbear, Forbearthy howling! Comrade so noisy, ever growling, I cannot suffer here to dwell.One or the other, mark me well, Forthwith must leave the cell. I'm loath theguest - right to withhold; The door's ajar, the passage clear; But what mustnow mine eyes behold! Are nature's laws suspended here? Real is it, or aphantom show? In length and breadth how doth my poodle grow! He liftshimself with threat'ning mien, In likeness of a dog no longer seen! Whatspectre have I harbour'd thus! Huge as a hippopotamus, With fiery eye,terrific tooth! Ah! now I know thee, sure enough! For such a base, half -hellish brood, The key of Solomon is good.

ííííSpirits (without)

ííííCaptur'd there within is one! Stay without and follow none! Like a fox in ironsnare, Hell's old lynx is quaking there,

ííííBut take heed! Hover round, above, below,

ííííTo and fro, Then from durance is he freed! Can ye aid him, spirits all, Leavehim not in mortal thrall! Many a time and oft hath he Served us, when atliberty.

ííííFaust

ííííThe monster to confront, at first, The spell of Four must be rehears'd;Salamander shall kindle, Writhe nymph of the wave, In air sylph shall dwindle,And Kobold shall slave.

ííííWho doth ignore The primal Four, Nor knows aright Their use and might,O'er spirits will he Ne'er master be!

ííííVanish in the fiery glow, Salamander! Rushingly together flow. Undine!Shimmer in the meteor's gleam, Sylphide! Hither bring thine homely aid,Incubus! Incubus! Step forth! I do adjure thee thus! None of the Four Lurksin the beast: He grins at me, untroubled as before; I have not hurt him in theleast. A spell of fear Thou now shalt hear. Art thou, comrade fell, Fugitivefrom Hell? See then this sign, Before which incline The murky troops of Hell!With bristling hair now doth the creature swell.Canst thou, reprobate, Read the uncreate, Unspeakable, diffused Throughoutthe heavenly sphere, Shamefully abused, Transpierced with nail and spear!Behind the stove, tam'd by my spells, Like an elephant he swells; Wholly nowhe fills the room, He into mist will melt away. Ascend not to the ceiling!Come, Thyself at the master's feet now lay! Thou seest that mine is no idlethreat. With holy fire I will scorch thee yet! Wait not the might That lies in thetriple - glowing light! Wait not the might Of all my arts in fullest measure!Mephistopheles

íííí(As the mist sinks, comes forward from behind the stove, in the dress of atravelling scholar) Why all this uproar? What's the master's pleasure?Faust

ííííThis then the kernel of the brute! A traveling scholar? Why I needs mustsmile.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííYour learned reverence humbly I salute! You've made me swelter in a prettystyle.

ííííFaust

ííííThy name?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííThe question trifling seems from one, Who it appears the Word doth rate solow; Who, undeluded by mere outward show, To Being's depths wouldpenetrate alone.

ííííFaust

ííííWith gentlemen like you indeed The inward essence from the name we read,As all too plainly it doth appear, When Beelzebub, Destroyer, Liar, meets theear. Who then art thou?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííPart of that power which still Produceth good, whilst ever scheming ill.Faust

ííííWhat hidden mystery in this riddle lies?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííThe spirit I, which evermore denies! And justly; for whate'er to light is broughtDeserves again to be reduced to naught; Then better 'twere that naught shouldbe. Thus all the elements which ye Destruction, Sin, or briefly, Evil, name, Asmy peculiar element I claim.

ííííFaust

ííííThou nam'st thyself a part, and yet a whole I see.Mephistopheles

ííííThe modest truth I speak to thee. Though folly's microcosm, man, it seems,Himself to be a perfect whole esteems: Part of the part am I, which at the firstwas all, A part of darkness, which gave birth to light, Proud light, who nowhis mother would enthrall, Contesting space and ancient rank with night. Yethe succeedeth not, for struggle as he will, To forms material he adhereth still;From them he streameth, them he maketh fair, And still the progress of hisbeams they check; And so, I trust, when comes the final wreck, Light will, erelong, the doom of matter share.

ííííFaust

ííííThy worthy avocation now I guess! Wholesale annihilation won't prevail, Sothou'rt beginning on a smaller scale.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííAnd, to say truth, as yet with small success. Oppos'd to naught, this clumsyworld, The something - it subsisteth still; Not yet is it to ruin hurl'd, Despitethe efforts of my will. Tempests and earthquakes, fire and flood, I've tried;Yet land and ocean still unchang'd abide! And then of humankind and beasts,the accursed brood, Neither o'er them can I extend my sway. What countlessmyriads have I swept away! Yet ever circulates the fresh young blood. It isenough to drive me to despair! As in the earth, in water, and in air, Athousand germs burst forth spontaneously; In moisture, drought, heat, cold,they still appear! Had I not flame selected as my sphere Nothing apart hadbeen reversed for me.

ííííFaust

ííííSo thou with thy cold devil's fist Still clench'd in malice impotent Dost thecreative power resist, The active, the beneficent! Henceforth some other taskessay, Of Chaos thou the wondrous son!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííWe will consider what you say, And talk about it more anon! For this timehave I leave to go?

ííííFaust

ííííWhy thou shouldst ask, I cannot see. Since thee I now have learned to know,At thy good pleasure, visit me. Here is the window, here the door, Thechimney, too, may serve thy need.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííI must confess, my stepping o'er Thy threshold a slight hindrance dothimpede; The wizard - foot doth me retain.

ííííFaust

ííííThe pentagram thy peace doth mar? To me, thou son of hell, explain, Howcamest thou in, if this thine exit bar? Could such a spirit aught ensnare?Mephistopheles

ííííObserve it well, it is not drawn with care, One of the angles, that which pointswithout, Is, as thou seest, not quite closed.

ííííFaust

ííííChance hath the matter happily dispos'd! So thou my captive art? No doubt!By accident thou thus art caught!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííIn sprang the dog, indeed, observing naught; Things now assume anothershape, The devil's in the house and can't escape.Faust

ííííWhy through the window not withdraw?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííFor ghosts and for the devil 'tis a law. Where they stole in, there they mustforth. We're free The first to choose; as to the second, slaves are we.Faust

ííííE'en hell hath its peculiar laws, I see! I'm glad of that! a pact may then bemade, The which you gentlemen will surely keep?Mephistopheles

ííííWhat e'er therein is promised thou shalt reap, No tittle shall remain unpaid.But such arrangements time require; We'll speak of them when next we meet;Most earnestly I now entreat, This once permission to retire.Faust

ííííAnother moment prithee here remain, Me with some happy word to pleasure.Mephistopheles

ííííNow let me go! ere long I'll come again, Then thou may'st question at thyleisure.

ííííFaust

íííí'Twas not my purpose thee to lime; The snare hast entered of thine own freewill: Let him who holds the devil, hold him still! So soon he'll catch him not asecond time.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííIf it so please thee, I'm at thy command; Only on this condition, understand;That worthily thy leisure to beguile, I here may exercise my arts awhile.Faust

ííííThou'rt free to do so! Gladly I'll attend; But be thine art a pleasant one!Mephistopheles

ííííMy friend,

ííííThis hour enjoyment more intense, Shall captivate each ravish'd sense, Thanthou could'st compass in the bound Of the whole year's unvarying round; Andwhat the dainty spirits sing, The lovely images they bring. Are no fantasticsorcery. Rich odours shall regale your smell, On choicest sweets your palatedwell, Your feelings thrill with ecstasy. No preparation do we need, Here wetogether are. Proceed.

ííííSpirits

ííííHence overshadowing gloom, Vanish from sight! O'er us thine azure dome,Bend, beauteous light! Dark clouds that o'er us spread, Melt in thin air! Stars,your soft radiance shed, Tender and fair. Girt with celestial might, Wingingtheir airy flight, Spirits are thronging. Follows their forms of light Infinitelonging! Flutter their vestures bright O'er field and grove! Where in their leafybower Lovers the livelong hour Vow deathless love. Soft bloometh bud andbower! Bloometh the grove! Grapes from the spreading vine Crown the fullmeasure; Fountains of foaming wine Gush from the pressure. Still where thecurrents wind, Gems brightly gleam. Leaving the hills behind On rolls thestream; Now into ample seas, Spreadeth the flood; Laving the sunny leas,Mantled with wood. Rapture the feather'd throng, Gaily careering, Sip as theyfloat along; Sunward they're steering; On towards the isles of light Wingingtheir way, That on the waters bright Dancingly play. Hark to the choral strain,Joyfully ringing! While on the grassy plain Dancers are springing; Climbing thesteep hill's side, Skimming the glassy tide, Wander they there; Others onpinions wide Wing the blue air; All lifeward tending, upward still wending,Towards yonder stars that gleam, Far, far above; Stars from whose tenderbeam Rains blissful love.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííWell done, my dainty spirits! now he slumbers! Ye have entranc'd him fairlywith your numbers! This minstrelsy of yours I must repay, Thou art not yet theman to hold the devil fast! With fairest shapes your spells around him cast,And plunge him in a sea of dreams! But that this charm be rent, the thresholdpassed, Tooth of rat the way must clear. I need not conjure long it seems,One rustles hitherward, and soon my voice will hear. The master of the ratsand mice, Of flies and frogs, of bugs and lice, Commands thy presence;without fear Come forth and gnaw the threshold here, Where he with oil hassmear'd it. - Thou Com'st hopping forth already! Now To work! The pointthat holds me bound Is in the outer angle found. Another bite - so - now 'tisdoneNow, Faustus, till we meet again, dream on.Faust (awaking)

ííííAm I once more deluded! must I deem That thus the throng of spiritsdisappear? The devil's presence, was it but a dream? Hath but a poodlescap'd and left me here?

ííííFaust And Mephistopheles - A Student

ííííStudy

ííííFaust

ííííA knock? Come in! Who now would break my rest?Mephistopheles

íííí'Tis I!

ííííFaust

ííííCome in!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííThrice be the words express'd.

ííííFaust

ííííThen I repeat, Come in! Mephistopheles

íííí'Tis well, I hope that we shall soon agree! For now your fancies to expel,Here, as a youth of high degree, I come in gold - lac'd scarlet vest, And stiff -silk mantle richly dress'd, A cock's gay feather for a plume, A long andpointed rapier, too; And briefly I would counsel you To don at once the samecostume, And, free from trammels, speed away, That what life is you mayessay.

ííííFaust

ííííIn every garb I needs must feel oppress'd, My heart to earth's low cares aprey. Too old the trifler's part to play, Too young to live by no desirepossess'd. What can the world to me afford? Renounce! renouce! is still theword; This is the everlasting song In every ear that ceaseless rings, Andwhich, alas, our whole life long, Hoarsely each passing moment sings. But tonew horror I awake each morn, And I could weep hot tears, to see the sunDawn on another day, whose round forlorn Accomplishes no wish of mine -not one. Which still, with froward captiousness, impains E'en the presentimentof every joy, While low realities and paltry cares The spirit's fond imaginingsdestroy. Then must I too, when falls the veil of night, Stretch'd on my palletlanguish in despair, Appalling dreams my soul affright; No rest vouchsafed meeven there. The god, who throned within my breast resides, Deep in my soulcan stir the springs; With sovereign sway my energies he guides, He cannotmove external things; And so existence is to me a weight. Death fondly Idesire, and life I hate.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííAnd yet, methinks, by most 'twill be confess'd That Death is never quite awelcome guest.

ííííFaust

ííííHappy the man around whose brow he binds The bloodstain'd wreath inconquest's dazzling hour; Or whom, excited by the dance, he finds Dissolv'din bliss, in love's delicious bower! O that before the lofty spirit's might,Enraptured, I had rendered up my soul!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííYet did a certain man refrain one night, Of its brown juice to drain the crystalbowl.

ííííFaust

ííííTo play the spy diverts you then?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííI own, Though not omniscient, much to me is known.Faust

ííííIf o'er my soul the tone familiar, stealing, Drew me from harrowing thought'sbewild'ring maze, Touching the ling'ring chords of childlike feeling, With sweetharmonies of happier days: So curse I all, around the soul that windeth Itsmagic and alluring spell, And with delusive flattery bindeth Its victim to thisdreary cell! Curs'd before all things be the high opinion, Wherewith the spiritgirds itself around! Of shows delusive curs'd be the dominion, Within whosemocking sphere our sense is bound! Accurs'd of dreams the treacherouswiles, The cheat of glory, deathless fame! Accurs'd what each as propertybeguiles, Wife, child, slave, plough, whate'er its name! Accurs'd be mammon,when with treasure He doth to daring deeds incite: Or when to steep the soulin pleasure, He spreads the couch of soft delight! Curs'd be the grape'sbalsamic juice! Accurs'd love's dream, of joys the first! Accurs'd be hope!accurs'd be faith! And more than all, be patience curs'd!Chorus of Spirits (invisible)

ííííWoe! Woe! Thou hast destroy'd The beautiful world With violent blow; 'Tisshiver'd! 'tis shatter'd! The fragments abroad by a demigod scatter'd! Nowwe sweep The wrecks into nothingness! Fondly we weep The beauty that'sgone! Thou, 'mongst the sons of earth, Lofty and mighty one, Build it oncemore! In thine own bosom the lost world restore! Now with unclouded senseEnter a new career; Songs shall salute thine ear, Ne'er heard before!Mephistopheles

ííííMy little ones these spirits be. Hark! with shrewd intelligence, How theyrecommend to thee Action, and the joys of sense! In the busy world to dwell,Fain they would allure thee hence: For within this lonely cell, Stagnate sap oflife and sense.

ííííForbear to trifle longer with thy grief, Which, vulture - like, consumes thee inthis den. The worst society is some relief, Making thee feel thyself a man withmen. Nathless, it is not meant, I trow, To thrust thee 'mid the vulgar throng. Ito the upper ranks do not belong; Yet if, by me companion'd, thou Thy stepsthrough life forthwith wilt take, Upon the spot myself I'll make Thy comrade;Should it suit thy need, I am thy servant, am thy slave indeed!Faust

ííííAnd how must I thy services repay?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííThereto thou lengthen'd repite hast!

ííííFaust

ííííNo! No! The devil is an egoist I know: And, for Heaven's sake, 'tis not hisway Kindness to any one to show. Let the condition plainly be exprest! Sucha domestic is a dangerous guest.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííI'll pledge myself to be thy servant here, Still at thy back alert and prompt tobe; But when together yonder we appear, Then shalt thou do the same forme.

ííííFaust

ííííBut small concern I feel for yonder world; Hast thou this system into ruinhurl'd, Another may arise the void to fill. This earth the fountain whence mypleasures flow, This sun doth daily shine upon my woe, And if this world Imust forego, Let happen then, - what can and will. I to this theme will closemine ears, If men hereafter hate and love, And if there be in yonder spheres Adepth below or height above.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííIn this mood thou mayst venture it. But make The compact! I at once willundertake To charm thee with mine arts. I'll give thee more Than mortal eyehath e'er beheld before.

ííííFaust

ííííWhat, sorry Devil, hast thou to bestow? Was ever mortal spirit, in its highendeavour, Fathom'd by Being such as thou? Yet food thou hast whichsatisfieth never, Hast ruddy gold, that still doth flow Like restless quicksilveraway, A game thou hast, at which none win who play, A girl who would, withamorous eyen, E'en from my breast, a neighbour snare, Lofty ambition's joydivine, That, meteor - like, dissolves in air. Show me the fruit that, ere 'tispluck'd, doth rot, And trees, whose verdure daily buds anew!Mephistopheles

ííííSuch a commission scares me not, I can provide such treasures, it is true; But,my good friend, a season will come round, When on what's good we mayregale in peace.

ííííFaust

ííííIf e'er upon my couch, stretched at my ease, I'm found, Then may my life thatinstant cease! Me canst thou cheat with glozing wile Till self - reproach away Icast, Me with joy's lure canst thou beguile; Let that day be for me the last! Bethis our wager!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííSettled!

ííííFaust

ííííSure and fast! When to the moment I shall say, ""Linger awhile! so fair thouart!"" Then mayst thou fetter me straightway, Then to the abyss will I depart!Then may the solemn death - bell sound, Then from thy service thou art free,The index then may cease its round. And time be never more for me!Mephistopheles

ííííI shall remember: pause, ere 'tis too late.

ííííFaust

ííííThereto a perfect right hast thou. My strength I do not rashly overrate. Slaveam I here, at any rate, If thine, or whose, it matters not, I trow.Mephistopheles

ííííAt thine inaugural feast I will this day Attend, my duties to commence. Butone thing! - Accidents may happen, hence A line or two in writing grant, Ipray.

ííííFaust

ííííA writing, Pedant! dost demand from me? Man, and man's plighted word, arethese unknown to thee? Is't not enough, that by the word I gave, My doomfor evermore is cast? Doth not the world in all its currents rave, And must apromise hold me fast? Yet fixed is this delusion in our heart; Who, of his ownfree will, therefrom would part? How blest within whose breast truth reignethpure! No sacrifice will he repent when made! A formal deed, with seal andsignature, A spectre this from which all shrink afraid. The word its liferesigneth in the pen, Leather and wax usurp the mastery then. Spirits of evil!what dost thou require? Brass, marble, parchment, paper, dost desire? Shall Iwith chisel, pen, or graver write? Thy choice is free; to me 'tis all the same.Mephistopheles

ííííWherefore thy passion so excite And thus thine eloquence inflame? A scrap isfor our compact good. Thou under - signest merely with a drop of blood.Faust

ííííIf this will satisfy thy mind, Thy whim I'll gratify, howe'er absurd.Mephistopheles

ííííBlood is a juice of very special kind.

ííííFaust

ííííBe not afraid that I shall break my word! The scope of all my energy Is inexact accordance with my vow. Vainly I have aspired too high; I'm on a levelbut with such as thou; Me the great spirit scorn'd, defied; Nature from meherself doth hide; Rent is the web of thought; my mind Doth knowledge loatheof every kind. In depths of sensual pleasure drown'd, Let us our fiery passionsstill! Enwrapp'd in magic's veil profound, Let wondrous charms our sensesthrill! Plunge we in time's tempestuous flow, Stem we the rolling surge ofchance! There may alternate weal and woe, Success and failure, as they can,Mingle and shift in changeful dance! Excitement is the sphere for man.Mephistopheles

ííííNor goal, nor measure is prescrib'd to you, If you desire to taste of everything, To snatch at joy while on the wing, May your career amuse and profittoo! Only fall to and don't be over coy!

ííííFaust

ííííHearken! The end I aim at is not joy; I crave excitement, agonizing bliss,Enamour'd hatred, quickening vexation. Purg'd from the love of knowledge,my vocation, The scope of all my powers henceforth be this, To bare mybreast to every pang, - to know In my heart's core all human weal and woe,To grasp in thought the lofty and the deep, Men's various fortunes on mybreast to heap, And thus to theirs dilate my individual mind, And share atlength with them the shipwreck of mankind.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííOh, credit me, who still as ages roll, Have chew'd this bitter fare from year toyear, No mortal, from the cradle to the bier, Digests the ancient leaven!Know, this Whole Doth for the Deity alone subsist! He in eternal brightnessdoth exist, Us unto darkness he hath brought, and here Where day and nightalternate, is your sphere.

ííííFaust

ííííBut 'tis my will!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííWell spoken, I admit! But one thing puzzles me, my friend; Time's short, artlong; methinks 'twere fit That you to friendly counsel should attend. A poetchoose as your ally! Let him thought's wide dominion sweep, Each good andnoble quality, Upon your honoured brow to heap; The lion's magnanimity,The fleetness of the hind, The fiery blood of Italy, The Northern's steadfastmind. Let him to you the mystery show To blend high aims and cunning low;And while youth's passions are aflame To fall in love by rule and plan! I fainwould meet with such a man; Would him Sir Microcosmus name.Faust

ííííWhat then am I, if I aspire in vain The crown of our humanity to gain,Towards which my every sense doth strain?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííThou'rt after all - just what thou art. Put on thy head a wig with countlesslocks, And to a cubit's height upraise thy socks, Still thou remainest ever,what thou art.

ííííFaust

ííííI fell it, I have heap'd upon my brain The gather'd treasure of man's thought invain; And when at length from studious toil I rest, No power, new - born,springs up within my breast; A hair's breadth is not added to my height, I amno nearer to the infinite.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííGood sir, these things you view indeed, Just as by other men they're view'd;We must more cleverly proceed, Before life's joys our grasp elude. The devil!thou hast hands and feet, And head and heart are also thine; What I enjoywith relish sweet, Is it on that account less mine? If for six stallions I can pay,Do I not own their strength and speed? A proper man I dash away, As theirtwo dozen legs were mine indeed. Up then, from idle pondering free, Andforth into the world with me! I tell you what; - your speculative churl Is like abeast which some ill spirit leads, On barren wilderness, in ceaseless whirl,While all around lie fair and verdant meads.

ííííFaust

ííííBut how shall we begin?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííWe will go hence with speed, A place of torment this indeed! A precious life,thyself to bore, And some few youngster evermore! Leave that to neighbourPaunch! - withdraw, Why wilt thou plague thyself with thrashing straw? Thevery best that thou dost know Thou dar'st not to the striplings show. One inthe passage now doth wait!

ííííFaust

ííííI'm in no mood to see him now.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííPoor lad! He must be tired, I trow; He must not go disconsolate. Hand methy cap and gown; the mask Is for my purpose quite first rate. (He changeshis dress.) Now leave it to my wit! I ask But quarter of an hour; meanwhileequip, And make all ready for our pleasant trip!(Exit Faust.)

ííííMephistopheles And A Student

ííííMephistopheles (in Faust's long gown)

ííííMortal! the loftiest attributes of men, Reason and Knowledge, only thuscontemn, Still let the Prince of lies, without control, With shows, and mockingcharms delude thy soul, I have thee unconditionally then! Fate hath endow'dhim with an ardent mind, Which unrestrain'd still presses on for ever, Andwhose precipitate endeavour Earth's joys o'erleaping, leaveth them behind.Him will I drag through life's wild waste, Through scenes of vapid dulness,where at last Bewilder'd, he shall falter, and stick fast; And, still to mock hisgreedy haste, Viands and drink shall float his craving lips beyond Vainly he'llseek refreshment, anguish - tost, And were he not the devil's by his bond, Yetmust his soul infallibly be lost!

ííííA Student enters

ííííStudent

ííííBut recently I've quitted home, Full of devotion am I come A man to knowand hear, whose name With reverence is known to fame.Mephistopheles

ííííYour courtesy much flatters me! A man like other men you see; Pray haveyou yet applied elsewhere?

ííííStudent

ííííI would entreat your friendly care! I've youthful blood and courage high; Ofgold I bring a fair supply; To let me go my mother was not fain; But here Ilonged true knowledge to attain.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííYou've hit upon the very place.

ííííStudent

ííííAnd yet my steps I would retrace. These walls, this melancholy room,O'erpower me with a sense of gloom; The space is narrow, nothing green, Nofriendly tree is to be seen: And in these halls, with benches filled, distraught,Sight, hearing fail me, and the power of thought.Mephistopheles

ííííIt all depends on habit. Thus at first The infant takes not kindly to the breast,But before long, its eager thirst Is fain to slake with hearty zest: Thus at thebreasts of wisdom day by day With keener relish you'll your thirst allay.Student

ííííUpon her neck I fain would hang with joy; To reach it, say, what means mustI employ?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííExplain, ere further time we lose, What special faculty you choose?Student

ííííProfoundly learned I would grow, What heaven contains would comprehend,O'er earth's wide realm my gaze extend, Nature and science I desire to know.Mephistopheles

ííííYour are upon the proper track, I find; Take heed, let nothing dissipate yourmind.

ííííStudent

ííííMy heart and soul are in the chase! Though to be sure I fain would seize, Onpleasant summer holidays, A little liberty and careless ease.Mephistopheles

ííííUse well your time, so rapidly it flies; Method will teach you time to win;Hence, my young friend, I would advise, With college logic to begin! Thenwill your mind be so well braced, In Spanish boots so tightly laced, That on'twill circumspectly creep, Thought's beaten track securely keep, Nor will it,ignis - fatuus like, Into the path of error strike. Then many a day they'll teachyou how The mind's spontaneous acts, till now As eating and as drinking free,Require a process; - one! two! three! In truth the subtle web of thought Is likethe weaver's fabric wrought: One treadle moves a thousand lines, Swift dartthe shuttles to and fro, Unseen the threads together flow, A thousand knotsone stroke combines. Then forward steps your sage to show, And prove toyou, it must be so; The first being so, and so the second, The third and fourthdeduc'd we see; And if there were no first and second, Nor third nor fourthwould ever be. This, scholars of all countries prize, Yet 'mong themselves noweavers rise. He who would know and treat of aught alive, Seeks first theliving spirit thence to drive: Then are the lifeless fragments in his hand, Thereonly fails, alas! the spirit - band. This process, chemists name, in learnedthesis, Mocking themselves, Naturae encheiresis.Student

ííííYour words I cannot full comprehend.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííIn a short time you will improve, my friend, When of scholastic forms youlearn the use; And how by method all things to reduce.Student

ííííSo doth all this my brain confound, As if a mill - wheel there were turninground.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííAnd next, before aught else you learn, You must with zeal to metaphysicsturn! There see that you profoundly comprehend, What doth the limit of man'sbrain transcend; For that which is or is not in the head A sounding phrase willserve you in good stead. But before all strive this half year From one fix'dorder ne'er to swerve! Five lectures daily you must hear; The hour stillpunctually observe! Yourself with studious zeal prepare, And closely in yourmanual look, Hereby may you be quite aware That all he utters standeth in thebook; Yet write away without cessation, As at the Holy Ghost's dictation!Student

ííííThis, Sir, a second time you need not say! Your counsel I appreciate quite;What we possess in black and white, We can in peace and comfort bearaway.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííA faculty I pray you name.

ííííStudent

ííííFor jurisprudence, some distaste I own.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííTo me this branch of science is well known, And hence I cannot yourrepugnance blame. Customs and laws in every place, Like a disease, an heir -loom dread, Still trail their curse from race to race, And furtively abroad theyspread. To nonsense, reason's self they turn; Beneficence becomes a pest;Woe unto thee, that thou'rt a grandson born! As for the law born with us,unexpressed; That law, alas, none careth to discern.Student

ííííYou deepen my dislike. The youth Whom you instruct, is blest in sooth! Totry theology I feel inclined.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííI would not lead you willingly astray, But as regards this science, you will findSo hard it is to shun the erring way, And so much hidden poison lies therein,Which scarce can you discern from medicine. Here too it is the best, to listenbut to one, And by the master's words to swear alone. To sum up all - Towords hold fast! Then the safe gate securely pass'd, You'll reach the fane ofcertainty at last.

ííííStudent

ííííBut then some meaning must the words convey.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííRight! But o'er - anxious thought, you'll find of no avail, For there preciselywhere ideas fail, A word comes opportunely into play Most admirableweapons words are found, On words a system we securely ground, In wordswe can conveniently believe, Nor of a single jot can we a word bereave.Student

ííííYour pardon for my importunity; Yet once more must I trouble you: Onmedicine, I'll thank you to supply A pregnant utterance or two! Three years!how brief the appointed tide! The field, heaven knows, is all too wide! If but afriendly hint be thrown, 'Tis easier then to feel one's way.Mephistopheles (aside)

ííííI'm weary of the dry pedantic tone, And must again the genuine devil play.(Aloud)

ííííOf medicine the spirit's caught with ease, The great and little world you studythrough, That things may then their course pursue, As heaven may please. Invain abroad you range through science' ample space, Each man learns onlythat which learn he can; Who knows the moment to embrace, He is yourproper man. In person you are tolerably made, Nor in assurance will you bedeficient: Self - confidence acquire, be not afraid, Others will then esteem youa proficient. Learn chiefly with the sex to deal! Their thousands ahs and ohs,These the sage doctor knows, He only from one point can heal. Assume adecent tone of courteous ease, You have them then to humour as you please.First a diploma must belief infuse, That you in your profession take the lead:You then at once those easy freedoms use For which another many a yearmust plead; Learn how to feel with nice address The dainty wrist; - and howto press, With ardent furtive glance, the slender waist, To feel how tightly it islaced.

ííííStudent

ííííThere is some sense in that! one sees the how and why.Mephistopheles

ííííGrey is, young friend, all theory: And green of life the golden tree.Student

ííííI swear it seemeth like a dream to me. May I some future time repeat my visit,To hear on what your wisdom grounds your views?Mephistopheles

ííííCommand my humble service when you choose.

ííííStudent

ííííEre I retire, one boon I must solicit: Here is my album, do not, Sir, deny Thistoken of your favour!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííWillingly!

íííí(He writes and returns the book.)

ííííStudent (reads)

ííííEritis Sicut Deus, Scientes Bonum Et Malum (He reverently closes the bookand retires.)

ííííMephistopheles

ííííLet but this ancient proverb be your rule, My cousin follow still, the wilysnake, And with your likeness to the gods, poor fool, Ere long be sure yourpoor sick heart will quake!

ííííFaust (enters)

ííííWhither away?

ííííMephistopheles

íííí""Tis thine our course to steer. The little world, and then the great we'll view.With what delight, what profit too, Thou'lt revel through thy gay career!Faust

ííííDespite my length of beard I need The easy manners that insure success; Th'attempt I fear can ne'er succeed; To mingle in the world I want address; I stillhave an embarrass'd air, and then I feel myself so small with other men.Mephistopheles

ííííTime, my good friend, will all that's needful give; Be only self - possessed, andthou hast learn'd to live.

ííííFaust

ííííBut how are we to start, I pray? Steeds, servants, carriage, where are they?Mephistopheles

ííííWe've but to spread this mantle wide, 'Twill serve whereon through air toride, No heavy baggage need you take, When we our bold excursion make,A little gas, which I will soon prepare, Lifts us from earth; aloft through air,Light laden we shall swiftly steer; I wish you joy of your new life - career.Auerbach's Cellar In Leipzig

ííííA Drinking Party

ííííFrosch

ííííNo drinking? Naught a laugh to raise? None of your gloomy looks, I pray!You, who so bright were wont to blaze, Are dull as wetted straw to - day.Brander

íííí'Tis all your fault; your part you do not bear, No beastliness, no folly.Frosch

íííí(pours a glass of wine over his head)

ííííThere, You have them both!

ííííBrander

ííííYou double beast!

ííííFrosch

íííí'Tis what you ask'd me for, at least!

ííííSiebel

ííííWhoever quarrels, turn him out! With open throat drink, roar, and shout.Hollo! Hollo! Ho!

ííííAltmayer

ííííZounds, fellow, cease your deaf'ning cheers! Bring cotton - wool! He splitsmy ears.

íííí'Tis when the roof rings back the tone, Then first the full power of the bass isknown.

ííííOur throats are tuned. Come let's commence!

ííííAn ugly song! a song political! A song offensive! Thank God, every morn Torule the Roman empire, that you were not born! I bless my stars at least thatmine is not Either a kaiser's or a chancellor's lot. Yet 'mong ourselves shouldone still lord it o'er the rest; That we elect a pope I now suggest. Ye know,what quality ensures A man's success, his rise secures.Frosch (sings)

ííííBear, lady nightingale above, Ten thousand greetings to my love.Siebel

ííííNo greetings to a sweetheart! No love - songs shall there be!Frosch

ííííLove - greetings and love kisses! Thou shalt not hinder me!(Sings)

ííííUndo the bolt! in silly night, Undo the bolt! the lover wakes. Shut to the bolt!when morning breaks.

ííííSiebel

ííííAy, sing, sing on, praise her with all thy might! My turn to laugh will comesome day. Me hath she jilted once, you the same trick she'll play. Somegnome her lover be! where cross - roads meet,

ííííWith her to play the fool; or old he - goat, From Blocksberg coming in swiftgallop, bleat A good night to her, from his hairy throat! A proper lad ofgenuine flesh and blood, Is for the damsel far too good; The greeting she shallhave from me, To smash her window - panes will be!Brander (striking on the table)

ííííSilence! Attend! to me give ear! Confess, sirs, I know how to live: Some love- sick folk are sitting here! Hence, 'tis but fit, their hearts to cheer, That I agood - night strain to them should give. Hark! of the newest fashion is mysong! Strike boldly in the chorus, clear and strong!(He sings)

ííííOnce in a cellar lived a rat, He feasted there on butter, Until his paunchbecame as fat As that of Doctor Luther. The cook laid poison for the guest,Then was his heart with pangs oppress'd, As if his frame love wasted.Chorus (shouting)

ííííAs if his frame love wasted.

ííííBrander

ííííHe ran around, he ran abroad, Of every puddle drinking. The house with ragehe scratch'd and gnaw'd, In vain, - he fast was sinking; Full many an anguish'dbound he gave, Nothing the hapless brute could save, As if his frame lovewasted.

ííííChorus

ííííAs if his frame love wasted.

ííííBrander

ííííBy torture driven, in open day, The kitchen he invaded, Convulsed upon thehearth he lay, With anguish sorely jaded; The poisoner laugh'd, Ha! ha! quothshe, His life is ebbing fast, I see, As if his frame love wasted.Chorus

ííííAs if his frame love wasted.

ííííI now must introduce to you Before aught else, this jovial crew, To show howlightly life may glide away; With tse folk here each day's a holiday. With littlewit and much content, Each on his own small round intent, Like sportive kittenwith its tail; While no sick - headache they bewail, And while their host willcredit give, Joyous and free from care they live.Brander

ííííThey're off a journey, that is clear, From their strange manners; they havescarce been here An hour.

ííííYou're right! Leipzig's the place for me! 'Tis quite a little Paris; people thereAcquire a certain easy finish'd air.

ííííSiebel

ííííWhat take you now these travellers to be?

ííííFrosch

ííííLet me alone! O'er a full glass you'll see, As easily I'll worm their secret out,As draw an infant's tooth. I've not a doubt That my two gentlemen are noblyborn, They look dissatisfied and full of scorn.Brander

ííííThey are but mountebanks, I'll lay a bet!

ííííAltmayer

ííííMost like.

ííííFrosch

ííííMark me, I'll screw it from them yet!

ííííMephistopheles (to Faust)

ííííThese fellows would not scent the devil out, E'en though he had them by thevery throat!

ííííFaust

ííííGood - morrow, gentlemen!

ííííSiebel

ííííThanks for your fair salute.

íííí(Aside, glancing at Mephistopheles,)

ííííHow! goes the fellow on a halting foot?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííIs it permitted here with you to sit? Then though good wine is not forthcominghere, Good company at least our hearts will cheer.Altmayer

ííííA dainty gentleman, no doubt of it.

ííííFrosch

ííííYou're doubtless recently from Rippach? Pray, Did you with Master Hansthere chance to sup?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííTo - day we pass'd him, but we did not stop! When last we met him he hadmuch to say Touching his cousins, and to each he sent Full many a greetingand kind compliment. (With an inclination towards Frosch.)Altmayer (aside to Frosch)

ííííYou have it there!

ííííSiebel

ííííFaith! he's a knowing one!

ííííFrosch

ííííHave patience! I will show him up anon!

ííííThat you're an amateur one plainly sees!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííOh no, though strong the love, I cannot boast much skill.Altmayer

ííííGive us a song!

ííííHark! did you rightly catch the words? a flea! An odd sort of a guest heneeds must be.

ííííMephistopheles (sings)

ííííA king there was once reigning, Who had a goodly flea, Him loved he withoutfeigning, As his own son were he! His tailor then he summon'd, The tailor tohim goes: Now measure me the youngster For jerkin and for hose!Brander

ííííTake proper heed, the tailor strictly charge, The nicest measurement to take,And as he loves his head, to make The hose quite smooth and not too large!Mephistopheles

ííííIn satin and in velvet, Behold the yonker dressed; Bedizen'd o'er with ribbons,A cross upon his breast. Prime minister they made him, He wore a star ofstate; And all his poor relations Were courtiers, rich and great.The gentlemen and ladies At court were sore distressed; The queen and allher maidens Were bitten by the pest, And yet they dared not scratch them,Or chase the fleas away. If we are bit, we catch them, And crack withoutdelay.

ííííChorus (shouting)

ííííIf we are bit, &c.

ííííBravo! That's the song for me!

ííííHurrah for wine and freedom still!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííWere but your wine a trifle better, friend, A glass to freedom I would gladlydrain,

ííííSiebel

ííííYou'd better not repeat those words again!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííI am afraid the landlord to offend; Else freely I would treat each worthy guestFrom our own cellar to the very best.

ííííSiebel

ííííOut with it then! Your doings I'll defend.

ííííFrosch

ííííGive a good glass, and straight we'll praise you, one and all. Only let not yoursamples be too small; For if my judgment you desire, Certes, an amplemouthful I require.

ííííAltmayer (aside)

ííííI guess they're from the Rhenish land.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííFetch me a gimlet here!

ííííSay, what therewith to bore? You cannot have the wine - casks at the door?Altmayer

ííííOur landlord's tool - basket behind doth yonder stand.Mephistopheles (takes the gimlet)

íííí(To Frosch)

ííííNow only say! what liquor will you take?

ííííFrosch

ííííHow mean you that? have you of every sort?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííEach may his own selection make.

ííííAltmayer (to Frosch)

ííííHa! Ha! You lick your lips already at the thought.Frosch

ííííGood, If I have my choice, the Rhenish I propose; For still the fairest gifts thefatherland bestows.

ííííMephistopheles

íííí(boring a hole in the edge of the table opposite to where Frosch is sitting)Give me a little wax - and make some stoppers - quick!Altmayer

ííííWhy, this is nothing but a juggler's trick!

ííííMephistopheles (to Brander)

ííííAnd you?

ííííBrander

ííííChampagne's the wine for me; Right brisk, and sparkling let it be!(Mephistopheles bores; one of the party has in the meantime prepared thewax - stoppers and stopped the holes.)

ííííBrander

ííííWhat foreign is one always can't decline, What's good is often scatter'd farapart. The French your genuine German hates with all his heart, Yet has arelish for their wine.

ííííI like not acid wine, I must allow, Give ma a glass of genuine sweet!Mephistopheles (bores)

ííííTokay

ííííShall, if you wish it, flow without delay.

ííííAltmayer

ííííCome! look me in the face! no fooling now! You are but making fun of us, Itrow.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííAh! ah! that would indeed be making free With such distinguished guests.Come, no delay; What liquor can I serve you with, I pray?Altmayer

ííííOnly be quick, it matters not to me. (After the holes are bored and stopped.)Mephistopheles (with strange gestures)

ííííGrapes the vine - stock bears, Horns the buck - goat wears! Wine is sap, thevine is wood, The wooden board yields wine as good. With a deeper glanceand true The mysteries of nature view! Have faith and here's a miracle! Yourstoppers draw and drink your fill!

íííí(addressing the flames)

ííííStop, Kind element, be still, I say!

íííí(To the Company.)

ííííOf purgatorial fire as yet 'tis but a drop.

ííííSiebel

ííííWhat means the knave! For this you'll dearly pay! Us, it appears, you do notknow.

ííííFrosch

ííííSuch tricks a second time he'd better show!

ííííMethinks'twere well we pack'd him quietly away.Siebel

ííííWhat, sir! with us your hocus - pocus play!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííSilence, old wine - cask!

ííííSiebel

ííííHow! add insult, too! Vile broomstick!

ííííBrander

ííííHold, or blows shall rain on you!

ííííAltmayer

íííí'Tis sorcery, I vow! Strike home! The fellow is fair game, I trow!(They draw their knives and attack Mephistopheles.)Mephistopheles (with solemn gestures)

ííííVisionary scenes appear! Words delusive cheat the ear! Be ye there, and beye here!

íííí(They stand amazed and gaze at each other.)

ííííAltmayer

ííííWhere am I? What a beauteous land!

ííííFrosch

ííííVineyards! unless my sight deceives?

ííííSiebel

ííííAnd clust'ring grapes too, close at hand!

ííííBrander

ííííAnd underneath the spreading leaves, What stems there be! What grapes Isee!

íííí(He seizes Siebel by the nose. The others reciprocally do the same, and raisetheir knives.)

ííííMephistopheles (as above)

ííííDelusion, from their eyes the bandage take! Note how the devil loves a jest tobreak!

íííí(He disappears with Faust; the fellows draw back from one another.)Siebel

ííííWhat was it?

ííííAltmayer

ííííHow?

ííííFrosch

ííííWas that your nose?

ííííBrander (to Siebel)

ííííAnd look, my hand doth thine enclose!

ííííAltmayer

ííííI felt a shock, it went through every limb! A chair! I'm fainting! All thingsswim!

ííííFrosch

ííííSay what has happened, what's it all about?

ííííSiebel

ííííWhere is the fellow? Could I scent him out, His body from his soul I'd soondivide!

ííííAltmayer

ííííWith my own eyes, upon a cask astride, Forth through the cellar - door I sawhim ride Heavy as lead my feet are growing.

íííí(Turning to the table.)

ííííI wonder is the wine still flowing!

ííííSiebel

íííí'Twas all delusion, cheat and lie.

ííííFrosch

íííí'Twas wine I drank, most certainly.

ííííBrander

ííííBut with the grapes how was it, pray?

ííííAltmayer

ííííThat none may miracles believe, who now will say?The Witch's Kitchen - Faust, Mephistopheles And The MonkiesA large caldron hangs over the fire on a low hearth; various figures appear inthe vapour rising from it. A Female Monkey sits beside the caldron to skim it,and watch that it does not boil over. The Male Monkey with the young onesis seated near, warming himself. The walls and ceiling are adorned with thestrangest articles of witch - furniture.

ííííFaust, Mephistopheles

ííííFaust

ííííThis senseless, juggling witchcraft I detest! Dost promise that in this foul nestOf madness, I shall be restored? Must I seek counsel from an ancient dame?And can she, by these rites abhorred, Take thirty winters from my frame?Woe's me, if thou naught better canst suggest! Hope has already fled mybreast. Has neither nature nor a noble mind A balsam yet devis'd of any kind?Mephistopheles

ííííMy friend, you now speak sensibly. In truth, Nature a method giveth to renewthy youth: But in another book the lesson's writ; It forms a curious chapter, Iadmit.

ííííFaust

ííííI fain would know it.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííGood! A remedy Without physician, gold, or sorcery: Away forthwith, and tothe fields repair, Begin to delve, to cultivate the ground, Thy senses andthyself confine Within the very narrowest round, Support thyself upon thesimplest fare, Live like a very brute the brutes among, Neither esteem itrobbery The acre thou dost reap, thyself to dung; This is the best method,credit me, Again at eighty to grow hale and young.Faust

ííííI am not used to it, nor can myself degrade So far, as in my hand to take thespade. This narrow life would suit me not at all.Mephistopheles

ííííThen we the witch must summon after all.

ííííFaust

ííííWill none but this old beldame do? Canst not thyself the potion brew?Mephistopheles

ííííA pretty play our leisure to beguile! A thousand bridges I could buildmeanwhile. Not science only and consummate art, Patience must also bearher part. A quiet spirit worketh whole years long; Time only makes the subtleferment strong. And all things that belong thereto, Are wondrous andexceeding rare! The devil taught her, it is true; But yet the draught the devilcan't prepare.

íííí(Perceiving the beasts.)

ííííLook yonder, what a dainty pair! Here is the maid! the knave is there!(To the beasts)

ííííIt seems your dame is not a home?

ííííThe Monkeys

ííííGone to carouse, Out of the house, Thro' the chimney and away!Mephistopheles

ííííHow long is it her wont to roam?

ííííThe Monkeys

ííííWhile we can warm our paws she'll stay.

ííííMephistopheles (to Faust)

ííííWhat think you of the charming creatures?

ííííFaust

ííííI loathe alike their form and features!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííNay, such discourse, be it confessed, Is just the thing that pleases me thebest.

íííí(To the Monkeys)

ííííTell me, ye whelps, accursed crew! What stir ye in the broth about?Monkeys

ííííCoarse beggar's gruel here we stew.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííOf customers you'll have a rout.

ííííThe He - Monkey (approaching and fawning on Mephistopheles)Quick! quick! throw the dice, Make me rich in a trice, Oh give me the prize!Alas, for myself! Had I plenty of pelf, I then should be wise.Mephistopheles

ííííHow blest the ape would think himself, if he Could only put into the lottery!(In the meantime the young Monkeys have been playing with a large globe,which they roll forwards)

ííííThe He - Monkey

ííííThe world behold; Unceasingly roll'd, It riseth and falleth ever; It ringeth likeglass! How brittle, alas! 'Tis hollow, and resteth never. How bright the sphere,Still brighter here! Now living am I! Dear son, beware! Nor venture there!Thou too must die! It is of clay; 'Twill crumble away; There fragments lie.Mephistopheles

ííííOf what use is the sieve?

ííííThe He - Monkey (taking it down)

íííí(He runs to the She - Monkey, and makes her look through it.)Look through the sieve! Dost know him the thief, And dar'st thou not call himso?

ííííMephistopheles (approaching the fire)

ííííAnd then this pot?

ííííThe Monkeys

ííííThe half - witted sot! He knows not the pot! He know not the kettle!Mephistopheles

ííííUnmannerly beast! Be civil at least!

ííííThe He - Monkey

ííííTake the whisk and sit down in the settle!

íííí(He makes Mephistopheles sit down.)

ííííFaust

íííí(who all this time has been standing before a looking - glass, nowapproaching, and now retiring from it)

ííííWhat do I see? what form, whose charms transcend The loveliness of earth,is mirror'd here! O Love, to waft me to her sphere, To me the swiftest of thypinions lend! Alas! If I remain not rooted to this place, If to approach morenear I'm fondly lur'd, Her image fades, in veiling mist obscur'd! Model ofbeauty both in form and face! Is't possible? Hath woman charms so rare? Inthis recumbent form, supremely fair, The essence must I see of heavenlygrace? Can aught so exquisite on earth be found?Mephistopheles

ííííThe six days' labour of a god, my friend, Who doth himself cry bravo, at theend, By something clever doubtless should be crown'd. For this time gazeyour fill, and when you please Just such a prize for you I can provide; Howblest is he to whom kind fate decrees, To take her to his home, a lovely bride!(Faust continues to gaze into the mirror. Mephistopheles stretching himself onthe settle and playing with the whisk, continues to speak.)Here sit I, like a king upon his throne; My sceptre this; - the crown I wantalone.

ííííThe Monkeys

íííí(who have hitherto been making all sorts of strange gestures, bringMephistopheles a crown, with loud cries)

ííííOh, be so good, With sweat and with blood The crown to lime!(They handle the crown awkwardly and break it in two pieces, with whichthey skip about.)

íííí'Twas fate's decree! We speak and see! We hear and rhyme.Faust (before the mirror)

ííííWoe's me! well - nigh distraught I feel!

ííííMephistopheles

íííí(pointing to the beasts)

ííííAnd even my own head almost begins to reel.

ííííThe Monkeys

ííííIf good luck attend, If fitly things blend, Our jargon with thought And withreason is fraught!

ííííFaust (as above)

ííííA flame is kindled in my breast! Let us begone! nor linger here!Mephistopheles

íííí(in the same position)

ííííIt now at least must be confessed, That poets sometimes are sincere.(The caldron which the She - Monkey has neglected begins to boil over; agreat flame arises, which streams up the chimney. The Witch comes down thechimney with horrible cries.)

ííííThe Witch Returns

ííííThe Witch

ííííOugh! ough! ough! ough! Accursed brute! accursed sow! The caldron dostneglect, for shame! Accursed brute to scorch the dame!(Perceiving Faust and Mephistopheles)

ííííWhom have we here? Who's sneaking here? Whence are ye come? Withwhat desire? The plague of fire Your bones consume!(She dips the skimming - ladle into the caldron and throws flames at Faust,Mephistopheles, and the Monkeys. The Monkeys whimper.)Mephistopheles

íííí(twirling the whisk which he holds in his hand, and striking among the glassesand pots)

ííííDash! Smash! There lies the glass! There lies the slime! 'Tis but a jest; I butkeep time, Thou hellish pest, To thine own chime!(While the Witch steps back in rage and astonishment.)Dost know me! Skeleton! Vile scarecrow, thou! Thy lord and master dostthou know? What holds me, that I deal not now Thee and thine apes astunning blow? No more respect to my red vest dost pay? Does my cock'sfeather no allegiance claim? Have I my visage masked to - day? Must I beforced myself to name?

ííííThe Witch

ííííMaster, forgive this rude salute! But I perceive no cloven foot. And your tworavens, where are they?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííThis once I must admit your plea; For truly I must own that we Each otherhave not seen for many a day. The culture, too, that shapes the world, at lastHath e'en the devil in its sphere embraced; The northern phantom from thescene hath pass'd, Tail, talons, horns, are nowhere to be traced! As for thefoot, with which I can't dispense, 'Twould injure me in company, and hence,Like many a youthful cavalier, False calves I now have worn for many a year.The Witch (dancing)

ííííI am beside myself with joy, To see once more the gallant Satan here!Mephistopheles

ííííWoman, no more that name employ!

ííííThe Witch

ííííBut why! what mischief hath it done?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííTo fable - books it now doth appertain; But people from the change havenothing won. Rid of the evil one, the evil ones remain. Lord Baron call thoume, so is the matter good; Of other cavaliers the mien I wear. Dost make noquestion of my gentle blood; See here, this is the scutcheon that I bear! (Hemakes an unseemly gesture.)

ííííThe Witch

íííí(laughing immoderately)

ííííHa! Ha! Just like yourself! You are, I ween, The same mad wag that youhave ever been!

ííííMephistopheles (to Faust)

ííííMy friend, learn this to understand, I pray! To deal with witches this is still theway.

ííííThe Witch

ííííNow tell me, gentlemen, what you desire?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííOf your known juice a goblet we require. But for the very oldest let me ask;Double its strength with years doth grow.

ííííThe Witch

ííííMost willingly! And here I have a flask, From which I've sipp'd myself erenow; What's more, it doth no longer stink; To you a glass I joyfully will give.(Aside.)

ííííIf unprepar'd, however, this man drink, He hath not, as you know, an hour tolive.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííHe's my good friend, with whom 'twill prosper well; I grudge him not thechoicest of thy store. Now draw thy circle, speak thy spell, And straight abumper for him pour!

ííííHa! Ha! Just like yourself! You are, I ween, The same mad wag that youhave ever been!

ííííMephistopheles (to Faust)

ííííMy friend, learn this to understand, I pray! To deal with witches this is still theway.

ííííThe Witch

ííííNow tell me, gentlemen, what you desire?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííOf your known juice a goblet we require. But for the very oldest let me ask;Double its strength with years doth grow.

ííííThe Witch

ííííMost willingly! And here I have a flask, From which I've sipp'd myself erenow; What's more, it doth no longer stink; To you a glass I joyfully will give.(Aside.)

ííííIf unprepar'd, however, this man drink, He hath not, as you know, an hour tolive.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííHe's my good friend, with whom 'twill prosper well; I grudge him not thechoicest of thy store. Now draw thy circle, speak thy spell, And straight abumper for him pour!

ííííThe lofty power Of wisdom's dower, From all the world conceal'd! Whothinketh not, To him I wot, Unsought it is reveal'd.Faust

ííííWhat nonsense doth the hag propound? My brain it doth well - nighconfound. A hundred thousand fools or more, Methinks I hear in chorus roar.Mephistopheles

ííííIncomparable Sibyl cease, I pray! Hand us the liquor without more delay.And to the very brim the goblet crown! My friend he is, and need not beafraid; Besides, he is a man of many a grade, Who hath drunk deep already.(The Witch, with many ceremonies, pours the liquor into a cup; as Faust lifts itto his mouth, a light flame arises.)

ííííMephistopheles

ííííGulp it down! No hesitation! It will prove A cordial, and your heart inspire!What! with the devil hand and glove, And yet shrink back afraid of fire? (TheWitch dissolves the circle. Faust steps out.)

ííííMephistopheles

ííííNow forth at once! thou dar'st not rest.

ííííWitch

ííííAnd much, sir, may the liquor profit you!

ííííMephistopheles (to the Witch)

ííííAnd if to pleasure thee I aught can do, Pray on Walpurgis mention thyrequest.

ííííWitch

ííííHere is a song, sung o'er, sometimes you'll see, That 'twill a singular effectproduce.

ííííMephistopheles (to Faust)

ííííCome, quick, and let thyself be led by me; Thou must perspire, in order thatthe juice Thy frame may penetrate through every part. Then noble idleness Ithee will teach to prize, And soon with ecstasy thou'lt recognise How Cupidstirs and gambols in thy heart.

ííííFaust

ííííLet me but gaze one moment in the glass! Too lovely was that female form!Mephistopheles

ííííNay! nay! A model which all women shall surpass, In flesh and blood ere longthou shalt survey.

íííí(Aside.)

ííííAs works that draught, thou presently shalt greet A Helen in each womanthou dost meet.

ííííA Street - Faust Meets Margaret

ííííFaust (Margaret passing by)

ííííFaust And Margaret: The meeting of Faust and Margaret.]Faust

ííííFair lady, may I thus make free To offer you my arm and company?Margaret

ííííI am no lady, am not fair, Can without escort home repair.(She disengages herself and exit.)

ííííFaust

ííííBy heaven! This girl is fair indeed! No form like hers can I recall. Virtue shehath, and modest heed, Is piquant too, and sharp withal. Her cheek's softlight, her rosy lips, No length of time will e'er eclipse! Her downward glancein passing by, Deep in my heart is stamp'd for aye; How curt and sharp heranswer too, To ecstasy the feeling grew!

íííí(Mephistopheles enters.)

ííííFaust

ííííThis girl must win for me! Dost hear?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííWhich?

ííííFaust

ííííShe who but now passed.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííWhat! She? She from confession cometh here, From every sin absolved andfree; I crept near the confessor's chair. All innocence her virgin soul, For nextto nothing went she there; O'er such as she I've no control!Faust

ííííShe's past fourteen.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííYou really talk

ííííLike any gay Lothario, Who every floweret from its stalk Would pluck, anddeems nor grace, nor truth, Secure against his arts, forsooth! This ne'er theless won't always do.

ííííFaust

ííííSir Moralizer, prithee, pause; Nor plague me with your tiresome laws!Goethe

ííííTo cut the matter short, my friend, She must this very night be mine, And if tohelp me you decline, Midnight shall see our compact end.Mephistopheles

ííííWhat may occur just bear in mind! A fortnight's space, at least, I need, A fitoccasion but to find.

ííííFaust

ííííWith but seven hours I could succeed; Nor should I want the devil's wile, Soyoung a creature to beguile.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííLike any Frenchman now you speak, But do not fret, I pray; why seek Tohurry to enjoyment straight? The pleasure is not half so great, As when at firstaround, above, With all the fooleries of love, The puppet you can knead andmould As in Italian story oft is told.

ííííFaust

ííííNo such incentives do I need.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííBut now, without offense or jest! You cannot quickly, I protest, In winningthis sweet child succeed. By storm we cannot take the fort, To stratagem wemust resort.

ííííFaust

ííííConduct me to her place of rest! Some token of the angel bring! A kerchieffrom her snowy breast, A garter bring me, - any thing!Mephistopheles

ííííThat I my anxious zeal may prove, Your pangs to sooth and aid your love, Asingle moment will we not delay, Will lead you to her room this very day.Faust

ííííAnd shall I see her? - Have her?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííNo! She to a neighbour's house will go; But in her atmosphere alone, Thetedious hours meanwhile you may employ, In blissful dreams of future joy.Faust

ííííCan we go now?

ííííMephistopheles

íííí'Tis yet too soon.

ííííFaust

ííííSome present for my love procure!

íííí(Exit.)

ííííMephistopheles

ííííPresents so soon! 'tis well! success is sure! Full many a goodly place I know,And treasures buried long ago; I must a bit o'erlook them now.(Exit.)

ííííEvening - A Small And Neat Room

ííííMargaret

íííí(braiding and binding up her hair)

ííííI would give something now to know, Who yonder gentleman could be! Hehad a gallant air, I trow, And doubtless was of high degree: That written onhis brow was seen Nor else would he so bold have been.(Exit.)

ííííMephistopheles

ííííCome in! tread softly! be discreet!

ííííFaust (after a pause)

ííííBegone and leave me, I entreat!

ííííMephistopheles (looking round)

ííííNot every maiden is so neat

íííí(Exit.)

ííííFaust (gazing round)

ííííWelcome sweet twilight, calm and blest, That in this hallow'd precinct reigns!Fond yearning love, inspire my breast, Feeding on hope's sweet dew thyblissful pains! What stillness here environs me! Content and order broodaround. What fulness in this poverty! In this small cell what bliss profound!(He throws himself on the leather arm - chair beside the bed)Receive me thou, who hast in thine embrace, Welcom'd in joy and grief theages flown! How oft the children of a by - gone race Have cluster'd round thispatriarchal throne! Haply she, also, whom I hold so dear, For Christmas gift,with grateful joy possess'd, Hath with the full round cheek of childhood, here,Her grandsire's wither'd hand devoutly press'd. Maiden! I feel thy spirit hauntthe place, Breathing of order and abounding grace. As with a mother's voice itprompteth thee, The pure white cover o'er the board to spread, To strew thecrisping sand beneath thy tread. Dear hand! so godlike in its ministry! The hutbecomes a paradise through thee! And here - (He raises the bed - curtain.)How thrills my pulse with strange delight! Here could I linger hours untold;Thou, Nature, didst in vision bright, The embryo angel here unfold. Here laythe child, her bosom warm With life; while steeped in slumber's dew, Toperfect grace, her godlike form, With pure and hallow'd weavings grew!And thou! ah here what seekest thou? How quails mine inmost being now!What wouldst thou here? what makes thy heart so sore? Unhappy Faust! Iknow thee now no more.

ííííDo I a magic atmosphere inhale? Erewhile, my passion would not brookdelay! Now in a pure love - dream I melt away. Are we the sport of everypassing gale?

ííííShould she return and enter now, How wouldst thou rue thy guilty flame!Proud vaunter - thou wouldst hide thy brow, And at her feet sink down withshame.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííQuick! quick! below I see her there.

ííííFaust

ííííAway! I will return no more!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííHere is a casket, with a store Of jewels, which I got elsewhere Just lay it inthe press; make haste! I swear to you, 'twill turn her brain; Therein sometrifles I have placed, Wherewith another to obtain. But child is child, and playis play.

ííííFaust

ííííI know not - shall I?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííDo you ask? Perchance you would retain the treasure? If such your wish, whythen, I say, Henceforth absolve me from my task, Nor longer waste yourhours of leisure. I trust you're not by avarice led! I rub my hands, I scratch myhead,

íííí(He places the casket in the press and closes the lock.)Now quick! Away! That soon the sweet young creature may The wish andpurpose of your heart obey; Yet stand you there As would you to the lecture- room repair, As if before you stood, Arrayed in flesh and blood, Physicsand metaphysics weird and grey! Away!

íííí(Exeunt.)

ííííMargaret (with a lamp)

ííííHere 'tis so close, so sultry now,

íííí(She opens the window.)

ííííYet out of doors 'tis not so warm. I feel so strange, I know not how I wish mymother would come home. Through me there runs a shuddering I'm but afoolish timid thing!

íííí(While undressing herself she begins to sing.)There was a king in Thule, True even to the grave; To whom his dyingmistress A golden beaker gave.

ííííAt every feast he drained it, Naught was to him so dear, And often as hedrained it, Gush'd from his eyes the tear.

ííííWhen death came, unrepining His cities o'er he told; All to his heir resigning,Except his cup of gold.

ííííWith many a knightly vassal At a royal feast sat he, In yon proud hallancestral, In his castle o'er the sea.

ííííUp stood the jovial monarch, And quaff'd his last life's glow, Then hurled thehallow'd goblet Into the flood below.

ííííHe saw it splashing, drinking, And plunging in the sea; His eyes meanwhilewere sinking, And never again drank he.

íííí(She opens the press to put away her clothes, and perceives the casket.)How comes this lovely casket here? The press I locked, of that I'm confident.'Tis very wonderful! What's in it I can't guess; Perhaps 'twas brought by someone in distress, And left in pledge for loan my mother lent.Here by a ribbon hangs a little key! I have a mind to open it and see!Heavens! only look! what have we here! In all my days ne'er saw I such asight! Jewels! which any noble dame might wear, For some high pageantrichly dight! This chain - how would it look on me! These splendid gems,whose may they be?

íííí(She puts them on and steps before the glass.)Were but the ear - rings only mine! Thus one has quite another air. Whatboots it to be young and fair? It doubtless may be very fine; But then, alas,none cares for you, And praise sounds half like pity too. Gold all doth lure,Gold doth secure All things. Alas, we poor!

ííííPromenade - Faust And Mephistopheles

ííííFaust walking thoughtfully up and down. To him MephistophelesMephistopheles

ííííBy all rejected love! By hellish fire I curse, Would I knew aught to make myimprecation worse!

ííííFaust

ííííWhat aileth thee? what chafes thee now so sore? A face like that I never sawbefore!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííI'd yield me to the devil instantly, Did it not happen that myself am he!Faust

ííííThere must be some disorder in thy wit! To rave thus like a madman, is it fit?Mephistopheles

ííííThink! only think! The gems for Gretchen brought, Them hath a priest nowmade his own! A glimpse of them the mother caught, And 'gan with secretfear to groan. The woman's scent is keen enough; Doth ever in the prayer -book snuff; Smells every article to ascertain Whether the thing is holy orprofane, And scented in the jewels rare, That there was not much blessingthere. ""My child,"" she cries, ""ill - gotten good Ensnares the soul, consumes theblood; With them we'll deck our Lady's shrine, She'll cheer our souls withbread divine!"" At this poor Gretchen 'gan to pout; 'Tis a gift - horse, at least,she thought, And sure, he godless cannot be, Who brought them here socleverly. Straight for a priest the mother sent, Who, when he understood thejest, With what he saw was well content. ""This shows a pious mind!"" Quothhe: ""Self - conquest is true victory. The Church hath a good stomach, she,with zest, Whole countries hath swallow'd down, And never yet a surfeitknown. The Church alone, be it confessed, Daughters, can ill - got wealthdigest.""

ííííFaust

ííííIt is a general custom, too. Practised alike by king and jew.Mephistopheles

ííííWith that, clasp, chain, and ring, he swept As they were mushrooms; and thecasket, Without one word of thanks, he kept, As if of nuts it were a basket.Promised reward in heaven, then forth he hied And greatly they were edified.Faust

ííííAnd Gretchen!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííIn unquiet mood Knows neither what she would or should; The trinkets nightand day thinks o'er, On him who brought them, dwells still more.Faust

ííííThe darling's sorrow grieves me, bring Another set without delay! The first,methinks, was no great thing.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííAll's to my gentleman child's play!

ííííFaust

ííííPlan all things to achieve my end! Engage the attention of her friend! No milk- and - water devil be, And bring fresh jewels instantly!Mephistopheles

ííííAy, sir! Most gladly I'll obey.

íííí(Faust exit.)

ííííMephistopheles

ííííYour doting love - sick fool, with ease, Merely his lady - love to please, Sun,moon, and stars in sport would puff away.

íííí(Exit.)

ííííThe Neighbour's House - Martha, Margaret And MephistophelesMartha (alone)

ííííGod pardon my dear husband, he Doth not in truth act well by me! Forth inthe world abroad to roam, And leave me on the straw at home. And yet hiswill I ne'er did thwart, God knows, I lov'd him from my heart.(She weeps.)

ííííPerchance he's dead! - oh wretched state! Had I but a certificate!(Margaret comes)

ííííMargaret

ííííDame Martha!

ííííMartha

ííííGretchen?

ííííMargaret

ííííOnly think! My knees beneath me well - nigh sink! Within my press I've foundto - day, Another case, of ebony. And things - magnificent they are, Morecostly than the first, by far.

ííííMartha

ííííYou must not name it to your mother! It would to shrift, just like the other.Margaret

ííííNay look at them! now only see!

ííííMartha (dresses her up)

ííííThou happy creature!

ííííMargaret

ííííWoe is me! Them in the street I cannot wear, Or in the church, or any where.Martha

ííííCome often over here to me, The gems put on quite privately; And thenbefore the mirror walk an hour or so, Thus we shall have our pleasure too.Then suitable occasions we must seize, As at a feast, to show them bydegrees: A chain at first, pearl ear - drops then, - your mother Won't seethem, or we'll coin some tale or other.

ííííMargaret

ííííBut, who, I wonder, could the caskets bring? I fear there's something wrongabout the thing!

íííí(A knock.)

ííííGood heavens! can that my mother be?

ííííMartha (peering through the blind)

íííí'Tis a strange gentleman, I see. Come in!

íííí(Mephistopheles enters)

ííííMephistopheles

ííííI've ventur'd to intrude to - day. Ladies, excuse the liberty, I pray.(He steps back respectfully before Margaret.)

ííííAfter dame Martha Schwerdtlein I inquire!

ííííMartha

íííí'Tis I. Pray what have you to say to me?

ííííMephistopheles (aside to her)

ííííI know you now, - and therefore will retire; At present you've distinguishedcompany. Pardon the freedom, Madam, with your leave, I will make free tocall again at eve.

ííííMartha (aloud)

ííííWhy, child, of all strange notions, he For some grand lady taketh thee!Margaret

ííííI am, in truth, of humble blood The gentleman is far too good Nor gems nortrinkets are my own.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííOh 'tis not the mere ornaments alone; Her glance and mien far more betray.Rejoiced I am that I may stay.

ííííMartha

ííííYour business, Sir? I long to know

ííííMephistopheles

ííííWould I could happier tidings show! I trust mine errand you'll not let me rue;Your husband's dead, and greeteth you.

ííííMartha

ííííIs dead? True heart! Oh misery! My husband dead! Oh, I shall die!Margaret

ííííAlas! good Martha! don't despair!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííNow listen to the sad affair!

ííííMargaret

ííííI for this cause should fear to love. The loss my certain death would prove.Mephistopheles

ííííJoy still must sorrow, sorrow joy attend.

ííííMartha

ííííProceed, and tell the story of his end!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííAt Padua, in St. Anthony's, In holy ground his body lies; Quiet and cool hisplace of rest, With pious ceremonials blest.

ííííMartha

ííííAnd had you naught besides to bring?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííOh yes! one grave and solemn prayer; Let them for him three hundred massessing! But in my pockets, I have nothing there.Martha

ííííNo trinket! no love - token did he send! What every journeyman safe in hispouch will hoard There for remembrance fondly stored, And rather hungers,rather begs than spend!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííMadam, in truth, it grieves me sore, But he his gold not lavishly hath spent.His failings too he deeply did repent, Ay! and his evil plight bewail'd still more.Margaret

ííííAlas! That men should thus be doomed to woe! I for his soul will many arequiem pray.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííA husband you deserve this very day; A child so worthy to be loved.Margaret

ííííAh no, That time hath not yet come for me.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííIf not a spouse, a gallant let it be. Among heaven's choicest gifts, I place, Sosweet a darling to embrace.

ííííMargaret

ííííOur land doth no such usage know.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííUsage or not, it happens so.

ííííMartha

ííííGo on, I pray!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííI stood by his bedside. Something less foul it was than dung; 'Twas straw halfrotten; yet, he as a Christian died. And sorely hath remorse his consciencewrung. ""Wretch that I was,"" quoth he, with parting breath, ""So to forsake mybusiness and my wife! Ah! the remembrance is my death, Could I but haveher pardon in this life!""

ííííMartha (weeping)

ííííDear soul! I've long forgiven him, indeed!

ííííMephistopheles

íííí""Though she, God knows, was more to blame than I.""Martha

ííííHe lied! What, on the brink of death to lie!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííIf I am skill'd the countenance to read, He doubtless fabled as he partedhence. ""No time had I to gape, or take my ease,"" he said, ""First to getchildren, and then get them bread; And bread, too, in the very widest sense;Nor could I eat in peace even my proper share.""Martha

ííííWhat, all my truth, my love forgotten quite? My weary drudgery by day andnight!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííNot so! He thought of you with tender care. Quoth he: ""Heaven knows howfervently I prayed, For wife and children when from Malta bound; The prayerhath heaven with favour crowned; We took a Turkish vessel which conveyedRich store of treasure for the Sultan's court; It's own reward our gallant actionbrought; The captur'd prize was shared among the crew And of the treasure Ireceived my due.""

ííííMartha

ííííHow? Where? The treasure hath he buried, pray?Mephistopheles

ííííWhere the four winds have blown it, who can say? In Naples as he stroll'd, astranger there, A comely maid took pity on my friend; And gave such tokensof her love and care, That he retained them to his blessed end.Martha

ííííScoundrel! to rob his children of their bread! And all this misery, this bitterneed, Could not his course of recklessness impede!Mephistopheles

ííííWell, he hath paid the forfeit, and is dead. Now were I in your place, mycounsel hear; My weeds I'd wear for one chaste year, And for another lovermeanwhile would look out.

ííííMartha

ííííAlas, I might search far and near, Not quickly should I find another like myfirst! There could not be a fonder fool than mine, Only he loved too wellaboard to roam; Loved foreign women too, and foreign wine, And lovedbesides the dice accurs'd.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííAll had gone swimmingly, no doubt, Had he but given you at home, On hisside, just as wide a range. Upon such terms, to you I swear, Myself with youwould gladly rings exchange!

ííííMartha

ííííThe gentleman is surely pleas'd to jest!

ííííMephistopheles (aside)

ííííNow to be off in time, were best! She'd make the very devil marry her.(To Margaret.)

ííííHow fares it with your heart?

ííííMargaret

ííííHow mean you, Sir?

ííííMephistopheles (aside)

ííííThe sweet young innocent!

íííí(aloud)

ííííLadies, farewell!

ííííMargaret

ííííFarewell!

ííííMartha

ííííBut ere you leave us, quickly tell! I from a witness fain had heard, Where,how, and when my husband died and was interr'd. To forms I've always beenattached indeed, His death I fain would in the journals read.Mephistopheles

ííííAy, madam, what two witnesses declare Is held as valid everywhere; Agallant friend I have, not far from here, Who will for you before the judgeappear. I'll bring him straight.

ííííMartha

ííííI pray you do!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííAnd this young lady, we shall find her too? A noble youth, far travelled, heShows to the sex all courtesy.

ííííMargaret

ííííI in his presence needs must blush for shame.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííNot in the presence of a crowned king!

ííííMartha

ííííThe garden, then, behind my house, we'll name, There we'll await you boththis evening.

ííííA Street - An Evening Walk In The Garden

ííííFaust. Mephistopheles

ííííFaust

ííííHow is it now? How speeds it? Is't in train?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííBravo! I find you all aflame! Gretchen full soon your own you'll name. Thiseve, at neighbour Martha's, her you'll meet again; The woman seemsexpressly made To drive the pimp and gipsy's trade.Faust

ííííGood!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííBut from us she something would request.

ííííFaust

ííííA favour claims return as this world goes.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííWe have on oath but duly to attest, That her dead husband's limbs,outstretch'd repose In holy ground at Padua.

ííííFaust

ííííSage indeed! So I suppose we straight must journey there!Mephistopheles

ííííSancta simplicitas! For that no need! Without much knowledge we have butto swear.

ííííFaust

ííííIf you have nothing better to suggest, Against you plan I must at once protest.Mephistopheles

ííííOh, holy man! methinks I have you there! In all your life say, have you ne'erFalse witness borne, until this hour? Have you of God, the world, and all itdoth contain, Of man, and that which worketh in his heart and brain, Notdefinitions given, in words of weight and power, With front unblushing, and adauntless breast? Yet, if into the depth of things you go, Touching thesematters, it must be confess'd, As much as of Herr Schwerdtlein's death youknow!

ííííFaust

ííííThou art and dost remain liar and sophist too.Mephistopheles

ííííAy, if one did not take a somewhat deeper view! To - morrow, in all honour,thou Poor Gretchen wilt befool, and vow Thy soul's deep love, in lover'sfashion.

ííííFaust

ííííAnd from my heart.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííAll good and fair! Then deathless constancy thou'lt swear; Speak of one allo'ermastering passion, Will that too issue from the heart?Faust

ííííForbear! When passion sways me, and I seek to frame Fir utterance forfeeling, deep, intense, And for my frenzy finding no fit name, Sweep round theample world with every sense, Grasp at the loftiest words to speak my flame,And call the glow, wherewith I burn, Quenchless, eternal, yea, eterne Is thatof sophistry a devilish play?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííYet am I right!

ííííFaust

ííííMark this, my friend, And spare my lungs; who would the right maintain, Andhath a tongue wherewith his point to gain, Will gain it in the end. But come, ofgossip I am weary quite; Because I've no resource, thou'rt in the right.A Garden

ííííMargaret on Faust's arm. Martha with Mephistopheles walking up and downMargaret

ííííI feel it, you but spare my ignorance, The gentleman to shame me stoops thuslow. A traveller from complaisance, Still makes the best of things; I know Toowell, my humble prattle never can Have power to entertain so wise a man.Garden Scene: Garden scene with Mephistopheles, Faust, and Margaret.Lithograph by Eugene Delacroix.]

ííííFaust

ííííOne glance, one word from thee doth charm me more, Than the world'swisdom or the sage's lore.

íííí(He kisses her hand.)

ííííMargaret

ííííNay! trouble not yourself! A hand so coarse, So rude as mine, how can youkiss! What constant work at home must I not do perforce! My mother tooexacting is.

íííí(They pass on.)

ííííMartha

ííííThus, sir, unceasing travel is your lot?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííTraffic and duty urge us! With what pain Are we compelled to leave full manya spot, Where yet we dare not once remain!

ííííMartha

ííííIn youth's wild years, with vigour crown'd, 'Tis not amiss thus through theworld to sweep; But ah, the evil days come round! And to a lonely grave asbachelor to creep, A pleasant thing has no one found.Mephistopheles

ííííThe prospect fills me with dismay.

ííííMartha

ííííTherefore in time, dear sir, reflect, I pray.

íííí(They pass on.)

ííííMargaret

ííííAy, out of sight is out of mind! Politeness easy is to you; Friends everywhere,and not a few, Wiser than I am, you will find.Faust

ííííO dearest, trust me, what doth pass for sense Full oft is self - conceit andblindness!

ííííMargaret

ííííHow?

ííííFaust

ííííSimplicity and holy innocence, When will ye learn your hallow'd worth toknow! Ah, when will meekness and humility, Kind and all - bounteousnature's loftiest dower

ííííMargaret

ííííOnly one little moment think of me! To think of you I shall have many an hour.Faust

ííííYou are perhaps much alone?

ííííMargaret

ííííYes, small our household is, I own, Yet must I see to it. No maid we keep,And I must cook, sew, knit, and sweep, Still early on my feet and late; Mymother is in all things, great and small, So accurate! Not that for thrift there issuch pressing need; Than others we might make more show indeed: My fatherleft behind a small estate, A house and garden near the city - wall. But fairlyquiet now my days, I own; As soldier is my brother gone; My little sister'sdead; the babe to rear Occasion'd me some care and fond annoy; But Iwould go through all again with joy, The darling was to me so dear.Faust

ííííAn angel, sweet, if it resembled thee!

ííííMargaret

ííííI reared it up, and it grew fond of me. After my father's death it saw the day;We gave my mother up for lost, she lay In such a wretched plight, and then atlength So very slowly she regain'd her strength. Weak as she was, 'twas vainfor her to try Herself to suckle the poor babe, so I Reared it on milk andwater all alone; And thus the child became as 'twere my own; Within my armsit stretched itself and grew, And smiling, nestled in my bosom too.Faust

ííííDoubtless the purest happiness was thine.

ííííMargaret

ííííBut many weary hours, in sooth, were also mine. At night its little cradle stoodClose to my bed; so was I wide awake If it but stirred; One while I wasobliged to give it food, Or to my arms the darling take; From bed full oft mustrise, whene'er its cry I heard, And, dancing it, must pace the chamber to andfro; Stand at the wash - tub early; forthwith go To market, and then mind thecooking too To - morrow like to - day, the whole year through. Ah, sir, thusliving, it must be confess'd One's spirits are not always of the best; Yet it arelish gives to food and rest. (They pass on.)Martha

ííííPoor women! we are badly off, I own; A bachelor's conversion's hard,indeed!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííMadam, with one like you it rests alone, To tutor me a better course to lead.Martha

ííííSpeak frankly, sir, none is there you have met? Has your heart ne'er attach'ditself as yet?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííOne's own fire - side and a good wife are gold And pearls of price, so saysthe proverb old.

ííííMartha

ííííI mean, has passion never stirred your breast?Mephistopheles

ííííI've everywhere been well received, I own.

ííííMartha

ííííYet hath your heart no earnest preference known?Mephistopheles

ííííWith ladies one should ne'er presume to jest.

ííííMartha

ííííAh! you mistake!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííI'm sorry I'm so blind But this I know - that you are very kind(They pass on.)

ííííFaust

ííííMe, little angel, didst thou recognize, When in the garden first I came?Margaret

ííííDid you not see it? I cast down my eyes.

ííííFaust

ííííThou dost forgive my boldness, dost not blame The liberty I took that day,When thou from church didst lately wend thy way?Margaret

ííííI was confused. So had it never been; No one of me could any evil say. Alas,thought I, he doubtless in thy mien, Something unmaidenly or bold hath seen?It seemed as if it struck him suddenly, Here's just a girl with whom one maymake free! Yet I must own that then I scarcely knew What in your favourhere began at once to plead; Yet I was angry with myself indeed, That I moreangry could not feel with you.

ííííFaust

ííííSweet love!

ííííMargaret

ííííJust wait awhile!

íííí(She gathers a star - flower and plucks off the leaves one after another.)Faust

ííííA nosegay may that be?

ííííMargaret

ííííNo! It is but a game.

ííííFaust

ííííHow?

ííííMargaret

ííííGo, you'll laugh at me!

íííí(She plucks off the leaves and murmurs to herself.)Faust

ííííWhat murmurest thou?

ííííMargaret (half aloud)

ííííHe loves me - loves me not.

ííííFaust

ííííSweet angel, with thy face of heavenly bliss!

ííííMargaret (continues)

ííííHe loves me - not - he loves me - not

íííí(Plucking off the last leaf with fond joy.)

ííííHe loves me!

ííííFaust

ííííYes!

ííííAnd this flower - language, darling, let it be, A heavenly oracle! He loveththee! Know'st thou the meaning of, He loveth thee? (He seizes both herhands.)

ííííMargaret

ííííI tremble so!

ííííFaust

ííííNay! Do not tremble, love! Let this hand - pressure, let this glance revealFeelings, all power of speech above; To give oneself up wholly and to feel Ajoy that must eternal prove! Eternal! - Yes, its end would be despair. No end!- It cannot end!

íííí(Margaret presses his hand, extricates herself, and runs away. He stands amoment in thought and then follows her).

ííííMartha (approaching)

ííííNight's closing.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííYes, we'll presently away.

ííííMartha

ííííI would entreat you longer yet to stay; But 'tis a wicked place, just hereabout; It is as if the folk had nothing else to do, Nothing to think of too, Butgaping watch their neighbours, who goes in and out; And scandal's busy still,do whatsoe'er one may. And our young couple?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííThey have flown up there. The wanton butterflies!Martha

ííííHe seems to take to her.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííAnd she to him. 'Tis of the world the way!

ííííA Summer-House

íííí(Margaret runs in, hides behind the door, holds the tip of her finger to her lip,and peeps through the crevice.)

ííííMargaret

ííííHe comes!

ííííFaust

ííííAh, little rogue, so thou Think'st to provoke me! I have caught thee now!(He kisses her.)

ííííMargaret

íííí(embracing him, and returning the kiss)

ííííDearest of men! I love thee from my heart!

íííí(Mephistopheles knocks.)

ííííFaust (stamping)

ííííWho's there?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííA friend!

ííííFaust

ííííA brute!

ííííMephistopheles

íííí'Tis time to part.

ííííMartha (comes)

ííííAy, it is late, good sir.

ííííFaust

ííííMayn't I attend you, then?

ííííMargaret

ííííOh no - my mother would - adieu, adieu!

ííííFaust

ííííAnd must I really then take leave of you? Farewell!Martha

ííííGood - bye!

ííííMargaret

ííííEre long to meet again! (Exeunt Faust and Mephistopheles.)Margaret

ííííGood heavens! how all things far and near Must fill his mind, - a man like this!Abash'd before him I appear, And say to all things only, yes. Poor simplechild, I cannot see, What 'tis that he can find in me.(Exit.)

ííííForest And Cavern - Faust And Mephistopheles

ííííFaust (alone)

ííííSpirit sublime! Thou gav'st me, gav'st me all For which I prayed! Not vainlyhast thou turn'd To me thy countenance in flaming fire: Gavest me gloriousnature for my realm, And also power to feel her and enjoy; Not merely with acold and wondering glance, Thou dost permit me in her depths profound, Asin the bosom of a friend to gaze. Before me thou dost lead her living tribes,And dost in silent grove, in air and stream Teach me to know my kindred.And when roars The howling storm - blast through the groaning wood,Wrenching the giant pine, which in its fall Crashing sweeps down its neighbourtrunks and boughs, While hollow thunder from the hill resounds; Then thoudost lead me to some shelter'd cave, Dost there reveal me to myself, andshow Of my own bosom the mysterious depths. And when with soothingbeam, the moon's pale orb Full in my view climbs up the pathless sky, Fromcrag and dewy grove, the silvery forms Of by - gone ages hover, and assuageThe joy austere of contemplative thought.

ííííOh, that naught perfect is assign'd to man, I feel, alas! With this exalted joy,Which lifts me near and nearer to the gods, Thou gav'st me this companion,unto whom I needs must cling, though cold and insolent, He still degrades meto myself, and turns Thy glorious gifts to nothing, with a breath. He in mybosom with malicious zeal For that fair image fans a raging fire; From cravingto enjoyment thus I reel And in enjoyment languish for desire.(Mephistopheles enters.)

ííííMephistopheles

ííííOf this lone life have you not your fill? How for so long can it have charms foryou? 'Tis well enough to try it if you will; But then away again to somethingnew!

ííííFaust

ííííWould you could better occupy your leisure, Than in disturbing thus my hoursof joy.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííWell! Well! I'll leave you to yourself with pleasure, A serious tone you hardlydare employ. To part from one so crazy, harsh, and cross, Were not in truth agrievous loss. The live - long day, for you I toil and fret; Ne'er from hisworship's face a hint I get, What pleases him, or what to let alone.Faust

ííííAy truly! that is just the proper tone! He wearies me, and would with thanksbe paid!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííPoor Son of Earth, without my aid, How would thy weary days have flown?Thee of thy foolish whims I've cured, Thy vain imaginations banished, And butfor me, be well assured, Thou from this sphere must soon have vanished. Inrocky hollows and in caverns drear, Why like an owl sit moping here?Wherefore from dripping stones and moss with ooze embued, Dost suck, likeany toad, thy food? A rare, sweet pastime. Verily! The doctor cleaveth still tothee.

ííííFaust

ííííDost comprehend what bliss without alloy From this wild wand'ring in thedesert springs? Couldst thou but guess the new life - power it brings, Thouwouldst be fiend enough to envy me my joy.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííWhat super - earthly ecstasy! at night, To lie in darkness on the dewy height,Embracing heaven and earth in rapture high, The soul dilating to a deity; Withprescient yearnings pierce the core of earth, Feel in your labouring breast thesix - days' birth, Enjoy, in proud delight what no one knows, While your love- rapture o'er creation flows, The earthly lost in beatific vision, And then thelofty intuition

íííí(With a gesture.)

ííííI need not tell you how - to close!

ííííFaust

ííííFie on you!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííThis displeases you? ""For shame!"" You are forsooth entitled to exclaim; Weto chaste ears it seems must not pronounce What, nathless, the chaste heartcannot renounce. Well, to be brief, the joy as fit occasions rise, I grudge younot, of specious lies. But long this mood thou'lt not retain. Already thou'rtagain outworn, And should this last, thou wilt be torn By frenzy or remorseand pain. Enough of this! Thy true love dwells apart, And all to her seems flatand tame; Alone thine image fills her heart, She loves thee with an all -devouring flame. First came thy passion with o'erpowering rush, Likemountain torrent, swollen by the melted snow; Full in her heart didst pour thesudden gush, Now has thy brooklet ceased to flow. Instead of sitting thronedmidst forests wild, It would become so great a lord To comfort the enamour'dchild, And the young monkey for her love reward. To her the hours seemmiserably long; She from the window sees the clouds float by As o'er the loftycity - walls they fly, ""If I a birdie were!"" so runs her song, Half through thenight and all day long. Cheerful sometimes, more oft at heart full sore; Fairlyoutwept seem now her tears, Anon she tranquil is, or so appears, And love -sick evermore.

ííííFaust

ííííSnake! Serpent vile!

ííííMephistopheles (aside)

ííííGood! If I catch thee with my guile!

ííííFaust

ííííVile reprobate! go get thee hence; Forbear the lovely girl to name! Nor in myhalf - distracted sense, Kindle anew the smouldering flame!Mephistopheles

ííííWhat wouldest thou! She thinks you've taken flight; It seems, she's partly inthe right.

ííííFaust

ííííI'm near her still - and should I distant rove, Her I can ne'er forget, ne'er loseher love; And all things touch'd by those sweet lips of hers, Even the veryHost, my envy stirs.

ííííMephistopheles

íííí'Tis well! I oft have envied you indeed, The twin - pair that among the rosesfeed.

ííííFaust

ííííPander, avaunt!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííGo to! I laugh, the while you rail, The power which fashion'd youth and maid,Well understood the noble trade; So neither shall occasion fail. But hence! -A mighty grief I trow! Unto thy lov'd one's chamber thou And not to deathshouldst go.

ííííFaust

ííííWhat is to me heaven's joy within her arms? What though my life her bosomwarms! Do I not ever feel her woe? The outcast am I not, unhoused, unblest,Inhuman monster, without aim or rest, Who, like the greedy surge, from rockto rock, Sweeps down the dread abyss with desperate shock? While she,within her lowly cot, which graced The Alpine slope, beside the waters wild,Her homely cares in that small world embraced, Secluded lived, a simple,artless child. Was't not enough, in thy delirious whirl To blast the steadfastrocks; Her, and her peace as well, Must I, God - hated one, to ruin hurl!Dost claim this holocaust, remorseless Hell! Fiend, help me to cut short thehours of dread! Let what must happen, happen speedily! Her direful doom fallcrushing on my head, And into ruin let her plunge with me!Mephistopheles

ííííWhy how again it seethes and glows! Away, thou fool! Her torment ease!When such a head no issue sees, It pictures straight the final close. Long lifeto him who boldly dares! A devil's pluck thou'rt wont to show; As for a devilwho despairs, Nothing I find so mawkish here below.Margaret's Room

ííííMargaret (alone at her spinning wheel)

ííííMy peace is gone, My heart is sore, I find it never, And nevermore!Where him I have not, Is the grave; and all The world to me Is turned to gall.My wilder'd brain Is overwrought; My feeble senses Are distraught.My peace is gone, My heart is sore, I find it never, And nevermore!For him from the window I gaze, at home; For him and him only Abroad Iroam.

ííííHis lofty step, His bearing high, The smile of his lip, The power of his eye,His witching words, Their tones of bliss, His hand's fond pressure And ah -his kiss! My peace is gone, My heart is sore, I find it never, And nevermore.My bosom aches To feel him near; Ah, could I clasp And fold him here!Kiss him and kiss him Again would I, And on his kisses I fain would die.Martha's Garden

ííííMargaret and Faust

ííííMargaret

ííííPromise me, Henry!

ííííFaust

ííííWhat I can!

ííííMargaret

ííííHow thy religion fares, I fain would hear. Thou art a good kind - hearted man,Only that way not well - disposed, I fear.

ííííFaust

ííííForbear, my child! Thou feelest thee I love; My heart, my blood I'd give, mylove to prove, And none would of their faith or church bereave.Margaret

ííííThat's not enough, we must ourselves believe!

ííííFaust

ííííMust we?

ííííMargaret

ííííAh, could I but thy soul inspire! Thou honourest not the sacraments, alas!Faust

ííííI honour them.

ííííMargaret

ííííBut yet without desire; 'Tis long since thou hast been either to shrift or mass.Dost thou believe in God?

ííííFaust

ííííMy darling, who dares say, Yes, I in God believe? Question or priest or sage,and they Seem, in the answer you receive, To mock the questioner.Margaret

ííííThen thou dost not believe?

ííííFaust

ííííSweet one! my meaning do not misconceive! Him who dare name? And whoproclaim, Him I believe? Who that can feel, His heart can steel, To say: Ibelieve him not? The All - embracer, All - sustainer, Holds and sustains he notThee, me, himself? Lifts not the Heaven its dome above? Doth not the firm -set earth beneath us lie? And beaming tenderly with looks of love, Climb notthe everlasting stars on high? Do we not gaze into each other's eyes? Nature'simpenetrable agencies, Are they not thronging on thy heart and brain,Viewless, or visible to mortal ken, Around thee weaving their mysteriouschain? Fill thence thy heart, how large soe'er it be; And in the feeling whenthou utterly art blest, Then call it, what thou wilt, Call it Bliss! Heart! Love!God! I have no name for it! 'Tis feeling all; Name is but sound and smokeShrouding the glow of heaven.

ííííMargaret

ííííAll this is doubtless good and fair; Almost the same the parson says, Only inslightly different phrase.

ííííFaust

ííííBeneath Heaven's sunshine, everywhere, This is the utterance of the humanheart; Each in his language doth the like impart; Then why not I in mine?Margaret

ííííWhat thus I hear Sounds plausible, yet I'm not reconciled; There's somethingwrong about it; much I fear That thou art not a Christian.Faust

ííííMy sweet child!

ííííMargaret

ííííAlas! it long hath sorely troubled me, To see thee in such odious company.Faust

ííííHow so?

ííííMargaret

ííííThe man who comes with thee, I hate, Yea, in my spirit's inmost depthsabhor; As his loath'd visage, in my life before, Naught to my heart e'er gave apang so great.

ííííFaust

ííííHim fear not, my sweet love!

ííííMargaret

ííííHis presence chills my blood. Towards all beside I have a kindly mood; Yet,though I yearn to gaze on thee, I feel At sight of him strange horror o'er mesteal; That he's a villain my conviction's strong. May Heaven forgive me, if Ido him wrong!

ííííFaust

ííííYet such strange fellows in the world must be!Margaret

ííííI would not live with such an one as he. If for a moment he but enter here, Helooks around him with a mocking sneer, And malice ill - conceal'd; That hewith naught on earth can sympathize is clear Upon his brow 'tis legiblyrevealed, That to his heart no living soul is dear. So blest I feel, within thinearms, So warm and happy, - free from all alarms; And still my heart dothclose when he comes near.

ííííFaust

ííííForeboding angel! check thy fear!

ííííMargaret

ííííIt so o'ermasters me, that when, Or wheresoe'er, his step I hear, I almostthink, no more I love thee then. Besides, when he is near, I ne'er could pray.This eats into my heart; with thee The same, my Henry, it must be.Faust

ííííThis is antipathy!

ííííMargaret

ííííI must away.

ííííFaust

ííííFor one brief hour then may I never rest, And heart to heart, and soul to soulbe pressed?

ííííMargaret

ííííAh, if I slept alone! To - night The bolt I fain would leave undrawn for thee;But then my mother's sleep is light, Were we surprised by her, ah me! Uponthe spot I should be dead.

ííííFaust

ííííDear angel! there's no cause for dread. Here is a little phial, - if she takeMixed in her drink three drops, 'twill steep Her nature in a deep and soothingsleep.

ííííMargaret

ííííWhat do I not for thy dear sake! To her it will not harmful prove?Faust

ííííShould I advise it else, sweet love?

ííííMargaret

ííííI know not, dearest, when thy face I see, What doth my spirit to thy willconstrain; Already I have done so much for thee, That scarcely more to dodoth now remain.

íííí(Exit.)

ííííMephistopheles (enters)

ííííMephistopheles

ííííThe monkey! Is she gone?

ííííFaust

ííííAgain hast played the spy?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííOf all that pass'd I'm well apprized, I heard the doctor catechised, And trusthe'll profit much thereby! Fain would the girls inquire indeed Touching theirlover's faith and creed, And whether pious in the good old way; They think, ifpliant there, us too he will obey.

ííííFaust

ííííThou monster, does not see that this Pure soul, possessed by ardent love, Fullof the living faith, To her of bliss The only pledge, must holy anguish prove,Holding the man she loves, fore - doomed to endless death!Mephistopheles

ííííMost sensual, supersensualist? The while A damsel leads thee by the nose!Faust

ííííOf filth and fire abortion vile!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííIn physiognomy strange skill she shows; She in my presence feels she knowsnot how; My mask it seems a hidden sense reveals; That I'm a genius shemust needs allow, That I'm the very devil perhaps she feels. So then to - nightFaust

ííííWhat's that to you?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííI've my amusement in it too!

ííííAt The Well

ííííMargaret and Bessy, with pitchers

ííííBessy

ííííOf Barbara hast nothing heard?

ííííMargaret

ííííI rarely go from home, - no, not a word.

ííííBessy

íííí'Tis true: Sybilla told me so to - day! That comes of being proud, methinks;She played the fool at last.

ííííMargaret

ííííHow so?

ííííBessy

ííííThey say That two she feedeth when she eats and drinks.Margaret

ííííAlas!

ííííBessy

ííííShe's rightly served, in sooth, How long she hung upon the youth! Whatpromenades, what jaunts there were, To dancing booth and village fair! Thefirst she everywhere must shine, He always treating her to pastry and to wineOf her good looks she was so vain, So shameless too, that to retain Hispresents, she did not disdain; Sweet words and kisses came anon And thenthe virgin flower was gone.

ííííMargaret

ííííPoor thing!

ííííBessy

ííííForsooth dost pity her? At night, when at our wheels we sat, Abroad ourmothers ne'er would let us stir. Then with her lover she must chat, Or on thebench or in the dusky walk, Thinking the hours too brief for their sweet talk;Her proud head she will have to bow, And in white sheet do penance now!Margaret

ííííBut he will surely marry her?

ííííBessy

ííííNot he! He won't be such a fool! a gallant lad Like him, can roam o'er landand sea, Besides, he's off.

ííííMargaret

ííííThat is not fair!

ííííBessy

ííííIf she should get him, 'twere almost as bad! Her myrtle wreath the boyswould tear; And then we girls would plagued her too, For we chopp'd strawbefore her door would strew!

íííí(Exit.)

ííííMargaret (walking towards home)

ííííHow stoutly once I could inveigh, If a poor maiden went astray; Not wordsenough my tongue could find, 'Gainst others' sin to speak my mind! Black as itseemed, I blacken'd it still more, And strove to make it blacker than before.And did myself securely bless Now my own trespass doth appear! Yet ah! -what urg'd me to transgress, God knows, it was so sweet, so dear!Zwinger

ííííEnclosure between the City - wall and the Gate.(In the niche of the wall a devotional image of the Mater dolorosa, with flower- pots before it)

ííííMargaret (putting fresh flowers in the pots)

ííííAh, rich in sorrow, thou, Stoop thy maternal brow, And mark with pitying eyemy misery! The sword in thy pierced heart, Thou dost with bitter smart, Gazeupwards on thy Son's death agony. To the dear God on high, Ascends thypiteous sigh, Pleading for his and thy sore misery. Ah, who can know Thetorturing woe, The pangs that rack me to the bone? How my poor heart,without relief, Trembles and throbs, its yearning grief Thou knowest, thoualone! Ah, wheresoe'er I go, With woe, with woe, with woe, My anguish'dbreast is aching! When all alone I creep, I weep, I weep, I weep, Alas! myheart is breaking! The flower-pots at my window Were wet with tears ofmine, The while I pluck'd these blossoms, At dawn to deck thy shrine! Whenearly in my chamber Shone bright the rising morn, I sat there on my pallet, Myheart with anguish torn. Help! from disgrace and death deliver me! Ah! rich insorrow, thou, Stoop thy maternal brow, And mark with pitying eye mymisery!

ííííNight. Street Before Margaret's Door

ííííValentine (a soldier, Margaret's brother)

ííííWhen seated 'mong the jovial crowd, Where merry comrades boasting loudEach named with pride his favourite lass, And in her honour drain'd his glass;Upon my elbows I would lean, With easy quiet view the scene, Nor give mytongue the rein until Each swaggering blade had talked his fill. Then smiling Imy beard would stroke, The while, with brimming glass, I spoke; ""Each to histaste! - but to my mind, Where in the country will you find, A maid, as mydear Gretchen fair, Who with my sister can compare?"" Cling! Clang! so rangthe jovial sound! Shouts of assent went circling round; Pride of her sex is she!- cried some; Then were the noisy boasters dumb.And now! - I could tear out my hair, Or dash my brains out in despair! Meevery scurvy knave may twit, With stinging jest and taunting sneer! Likeskulking debtor I must sit, And sweat each casual word to hear! And though Ismash'd them one and all, Yet them I could not liars call.Who comes this way? who's sneaking here? If I mistake not, two draw near.If he be one, have at him; - well I wot Alive he shall not leave this spot!Faust. Mephistopheles

ííííFaust

ííííHow from yon sacristy, athwart the night, Its beams the ever - burning taperthrows, While ever waning, fades the glimmering light, As gathering darknessdoth around it close! So night - like gloom doth in my bosom reign.Mephistopheles

ííííI'm like a tom - cat in a thievish vein, That up fire - ladders tall and steep, Andround the walls doth slyly creep; Virtuous withal, I feel, with, I confess, Atouch of thievish joy and wantonness. Thus through my limbs already burnsThe glorious Walpurgis night! After to - morrow it returns, Then why onewakes, one knows aright!

ííííFaust

ííííMeanwhile, the treasure I see glimmering there, Will it ascend into the openair?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííEre long thou wilt proceed with pleasure, To raise the casket with its treasure;I took a peep, therein are stored, Of lion - dollars a rich hoard.Faust

ííííAnd not a trinket? not a ring? Wherewith my lovely girl to deck?Mephistopheles

ííííI saw among them some such thing, A string of pearls to grace her neck.Faust

íííí'Tis well! I'm always loath to go, Without some gift my love to show.Mephistopheles

ííííSome pleasures gratis to enjoy, Should surely cause you no annoy. Whilebright with stars the heavens appear, I'll sing a masterpiece of art: A moralsong shall charm her ear, More surely to beguile her heart.(Sings to the guitar.)

ííííKathrina say, Why lingering stay At dawn of day Before your lover's door?Maiden, beware, Nor enter there, Lest forth you fare, A maiden never more.Maiden take heed! Reck well my rede! Is't done, the deed? Good night, youpoor, poor thing! The spoiler's lies, His arts despise, Nor yield your prize,Without the marriage ring!

ííííValentine (steps forward)

ííííWhom are you luring here? I'll give it you! Accursed rat - catchers, yourstrains I'll end! First, to the devil the guitar I'll send! Then to the devil with thesinger too!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííThe poor guitar! 'tis done for now.

ííííValentine

ííííYour skull shall follow next, I trow!

ííííMephistopheles (to Faust)

ííííDoctor, stand fast! your strength collect! Be prompt, and do as I direct. Outwith your whisk, keep close, I pray, I'll parry! do you thrust away!Valentine

ííííThen parry that!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííWhy not?

ííííValentine

ííííThat too!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííWith ease!

ííííValentine

ííííThe devil fights for you! Why how is this? my hand's already lamed!Mephistopheles (to Faust)

ííííThrust home!

ííííValentine (falls)

ííííAlas!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííThere! Now the lubber's tamed! But quick, away! We must at once takewing; A cry of murder strikes upon the ear; With the police I know my courseto steer, But with the blood - ban 'tis another thing.Martha (at the window)

ííííWithout! without!

ííííMargaret (at the window)

ííííQuick, bring a light!

ííííMartha (as above)

ííííThey rail and scuffle, scream and fight!

ííííPeople

ííííOne lieth here already dead!

ííííMartha (coming out)

ííííWhere are the murderers? are they fled?

ííííMargaret (coming out)

ííííWho lieth here?

ííííPeople

ííííThy mother's son.

ííííMargaret

ííííAlmighty God! I am undone!

ííííValentine

ííííI'm dying - 'tis a soon - told tale, And sooner done the deed. Why, women,do ye howl and wail? To my last words give heed! (All gather round him.) MyGretchen see! still young art thou, Art not discreet enough, I trow, Thou dostthy matters ill; Let this in confidence be said: Since thou the path of shamedost tread, Tread it with right good will!

ííííMargaret

ííííMy brother! God! what can this mean?

ííííValentine

ííííAbstain, Nor dare God's holy name profane! What's done, alas, is done andpast! Matters will take their course at last; By stealth thou dost begin withone, Others will follow him anon; And when a dozen thee have known,Thou'lt common be to all the town. When infamy is newly born, In secret sheis brought to light, And the mysterious veil of night O'er head and ears isdrawn; The loathsome birth men fain would slay; But soon, full grown, shewaxes bold, And though not fairer to behold, With brazen front insults theday: The more abhorrent to the sight, The more she courts the day's purelight.

ííííThe time already I discern, When thee all honest folk will spurn, And shun thyhated form to meet, As when a corpse infects the street. Thy heart will sink inblank despair, When they shall look thee in the face! A golden chain no morethou'lt wear! Nor near the altar take in church thy place! In fair lace collarsimply dight Thou'lt dance no more with spirits light! In darksome cornersthou wilt bide, Where beggars vile and cripples hide, And e'en though Godthy crime forgive, On earth, a thing accursed, thou'lt live!Martha

ííííYour parting soul to God commend! Your dying breath in slander will youspend?

ííííValentine

ííííCould I but reach thy wither'd frame, Thou wretched beldame, void ofshame! Full measure I might hope to win Of pardon then for every sin.Margaret

ííííBrother! what agonizing pain!

ííííValentine

ííííI tell thee, from vain tears abstain! 'Twas thy dishonour pierced my heart, Thyfall the fatal death - stab gave. Through the death - sleep I now depart ToGod, a soldier true and brave. (dies.)

ííííEvil - Spirit behind Margaret

ííííEvil - Spirit

ííííHow different, Gretchen, was it once with thee, When thou, still full ofinnocence, Here to the altar camest, And from the small and well - conn'dbook Didst lisp thy prayer, Half childish sport, Half God in thy young heart!Gretchen! What thoughts are thine? What deed of shame Lurks in thy sinfulheart? Is thy prayer utter'd for thy mother's soul, Who into long, long tormentslept through thee? Whose blood is on thy threshold? - And stirs there notalready 'neath thy heart Another quick'ning pulse, that even now Torturesitself and thee With its foreboding presence?

ííííMargaret

ííííWoe! Woe! Oh could I free me from the thoughts That hither, thither, crowdupon my brain, Against my will!

ííííChorus

ííííDies irae, dies illa, Solvet saeclum in favilla.(The organ sounds.)

ííííEvil - Spirit

ííííGrim horror seizes thee! The trumpet sounds! The graves are shaken! Andthy heart From ashy rest For torturing flames A new created, Trembles intolife!

ííííMargaret

ííííWould I were hence! It is as if the organ Choked my breath, As if the choirMelted my inmost heart!

ííííChorus

ííííJudex ergo cum sedebit, Quidquid latet adparebit, Nil inultum remanebit.Margaret

ííííI feel oppressed! The pillars of the wall Imprison me! The vaulted roofWeighs down upon me! - air!

ííííEvil - Spirit

ííííWouldst hide thee? sin and shame Remain not hidden! Air! light! Woe's thee!Chorus

ííííQuid sum miser tunc dicturus? Quem patronum rogaturus! Cum vix justus sitsecurus.

ííííWalpurgis - Night

ííííAct four, scene one, ""Walpurgis Night"" theme from the opera ""Faust"" 1859,by Charles Gounod. Over the heather, marshes, meadows, Light as a feather,Eerie shadows, Airily flashing lower, higher, flaming and flashing, glowing fire,they float, they hover, below, above, In fields of clover, In wood and grove,Flames burning brightly, Rays blazing red, Souls drifting lightly, Souls of thedead.

ííííThe Hartz Mountains. District of Schierke and ElendFaust and Mephistopheles

ííííMephistopheles

ííííA broomstick dost thou not at least desire? The roughest he - goat fain wouldI bestride, By this road from our goal we're still far wide.Faust

ííííWhile fresh upon my legs, so long I naught require, Except this knotty staff.Beside, What boots it to abridge a pleasant way? Along the labyrinth of thesevales to creep, Then scale these rocks, whence, in eternal spray, Adown thecliffs the silvery fountains leap: Such is the joy that seasons paths like these!Spring weaves already in the birchen trees; E'en the late pine - grove feels herquickening powers; Should she not work within these limbs of ours?Mephistopheles

ííííNaught of this genial influence do I know! Within me all is wintry. Frost andsnow I should prefer my dismal path to bound. How sadly, yonder, withbelated glow Rises the ruddy moon's imperfect round, Shedding so faint alight, at every tread One's sure to stumble 'gainst a rock or tree! An IgnisFatuus I must call instead. Yonder one burning merrily, I see. Holla! myfriend! may I request your light? Why should you flare away so uselessly? Bekind enough to show us up the height!

ííííIgnis Fatuus

ííííThrough reverence, I hope I may subdue The lightness of my nature; true, Ourcourse is but a zigzag one.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííHo! ho!

ííííSo men, forsooth, he thinks to imitate! Now, in the devil's name, for once gostraight! Or out at once your flickering life I'll blow.Ignis Fatuus

ííííThat you are master here is obvious quite; To do your will, I'll cordially essay;Only reflect! The hill is magic - mad to - night; And if to show the path youchoose a meteor's light, You must not wonder should we go astray.Faust, Mephistopheles, Ignis Fatuus (in alternate song)Through the dream and magic - sphere, As it seems, we now are speeding;Honour win, us rightly leading, That betimes we may appear In yon wide anddesert region!

ííííTrees on trees, a stalwart legion, Swiftly past us are retreating, And the cliffswith lowly greeting; Rocks long - snouted, row on row, How they snort, andhow they blow!

ííííThrough the stones and heather springing, Brook and brooklet haste below;Hark the rustling! Hark the singing! Hearken to love's plaintive lays; Voices ofthose heavenly days What we hope, and what we love! Like a tale of oldentime, Echo's voice prolongs the chime.

ííííTo - whit! To - whoo! It sounds more near; Plover, owl and jay appear, Allawake, around, above? Paunchy salamanders too Peer, long - limbed, thebushes through! And, like snakes, the roots of treesCoil themselves from rock and sand, Stretching many a wondrous band, Usto frighten, us to seize; From rude knots with life embued, Polyp - fangsabroad they spread, To snare the wanderer! 'Neath our tread, Mice, inmyriads, thousand - hued, Through the heath and through the moss! And thefire - flies' glittering throng, Wildering escort, whirls along, Here and there, ourpath across. Tell me, stand we motionless, Or still forward do we press? Allthings round us whirl and fly; Rocks and trees make strange grimaces,Dazzling meteors change their places, How they puff and multiply!Mephistopheles

ííííNow grasp my doublet - we at last A central peak have reached, whichshows, If round a wondering glance we cast, How in the mountain Mammonglows,

ííííFaust

ííííHow through the chasms strangely gleams, A lurid light, like dawn's red glow,Pervading with its quivering beams, The gorges of the gulf below! Herevapours rise, there clouds float by, Here through the mist the light doth shine;Now, like a fount, it bursts on high, Meanders now, a slender line; Farreaching, with a hundred veins, Here through the valley see it glide; Here,where its force the gorge restrains, At once it scatters, far and wide; Anear,like showers of golden sand Strewn broadcast, sputter sparks of light: Andmark yon rocky walls that stand Ablaze, in all their towering height!Mephistopheles

ííííDoth not Sir Mammon for this fete Grandly illume his palace! Thou Art luckyto have seen it; now, The boisterous guests, I feel, are coming straight.Faust

ííííHow through the air the storm doth whirl! Upon my neck it strikes withsudden shock.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííCling to these ancient ribs of granite rock, Else to yon depths profound it youwill hurl. A murky vapour thickens night. Hark! Through the woods thetempests roar! The owlets flit in wild affright. Hark! Splinter'd are the columnsthat upbore The leafy palace, green for aye: The shivered branches whirr andsigh, Yawn the huge trunks with mighty groan. The roots upriven, creak andmoan! In fearful and entangled fall, One crashing ruin whelms them all, Whilethrough the desolate abyss, Sweeping the wreck - strewn precipice, Theraging storm - blasts howl and hiss! Aloft strange voices dost thou hear?Distant now and now more near? Hark! the mountain ridge along, Streametha raving magic - song!

ííííWitches And Wizards Chorus - Visions And DancesWitches (in chorus)

ííííNow to the Brocken the witches hie, The stubble is yellow, the corn is green;Thither the gathering legions fly, And sitting aloft is Sir Urian seen: O'er stickand o'er stone they go whirling along, Witches and he - goats, a motleythrong,

ííííVoices

ííííAlone old Baubo's coming now; She rides upon a farrow sow.Chorus

ííííHonour to her, to whom honour is due! Forward, Dame Baubo! Honour toyou! A goodly sow and mother thereon, The whole witch chorus followsanon.

ííííVoice

ííííWhich way didst come?

ííííVoice

ííííO'er Ilsenstein! There I peep'd in an owlet's nest. With her broad eye shegazed in mine!

ííííVoice

ííííDrive to the devil, thou hellish pest! Why ride so hard?Voice

ííííShe has graz'd my side, Look at the wounds, how deep and how wide!Witches (in chorus)

ííííThe way is broad, the way is long; What mad pursuit! What tumult wild!Scratches the besom and sticks the prong; Crush'd is the mother, and stifledthe child.

ííííWizards (half chorus)

ííííLike house - encumber'd snail we creep; While far ahead the women keep,For when to the devil's house we speed, By a thousand steps they take thelead.

ííííThe Other Half

ííííNot so, precisely do we view it; They with a thousand steps may do it; But letthem hasten as they can, With one long bound 'tis clear'd by man.Voices (above)

ííííCome with us, come with us from Felsensee.

ííííVoices (from below)

ííííAloft to you we would mount with glee! We wash, and free from all stain arewe, Yet barren evermore must be!

ííííBoth Choruses

ííííThe wind is hushed, the stars grow pale, The pensive moon her light doth veil;And whirling on, the magic choir Sputters forth sparks of drizzling fire.Voice (from below)

ííííStay! stay!

ííííVoice (from above)

ííííWhat voice of woe Calls from the cavern'd depths below?Voice (from below)

ííííTake me with you! Oh take me too! Three centuries I climb in vain, And yetcan ne'er the summit gain! To be with my kindred I am fain.Both Choruses

ííííBroom and pitch - fork, goat and prong, Mounted on these we whirl along;Who vainly strives to climb to - night, Is evermore a luckless wight!Demi - Witch (below)

ííííI hobble after, many a day; Already the others are far away! No rest at homecan I obtain Here too my efforts are in vain!

ííííChorus of Witches

ííííSalve gives the witches strength to rise; A rag for a sail does well enough; Agoodly ship is every trough; To - night who flies not, never flies.Both Choruses

ííííAnd when the topmost peak we round, Then alight ye on the ground; Theheath's wide regions cover ye With your mad swarms of witchery!(They let themselves down.)

ííííMephistopleles

ííííThey crowd and jostle, whirl and flutter! They whisper, babble, twirl, andsplutter! They glimmer, sparkle, stink and flare A true witch - element!Beware! Stick close! else we shall severed be. Where art thou?Faust (in the distance)

ííííHere!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííAlready, whirl'd so far away! The master then indeed I needs must play. Giveground! Squire Voland comes! Sweet folk, give ground! Here, doctor, graspme! With a single bound Let us escape this ceaseless jar; Even for me toomad these people are. Hard by there shineth something with peculiar glare,Yon brake allureth me; it is not far; Come, come along with me! we'll slip inthere.

ííííFaust

ííííSpirit of contradiction! Lead! I'll follow straight! 'Twas wisely done, however,to repair On May - night to the Brocken, and when there By our own choiceourselves to isolate!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííMark, of those flames the motley glare! A merry club assembles there. In asmall circle one is not alone.

ííííFaust

ííííI'd rather be above, though, I must own! Already fire and eddying smoke Iview; The impetuous millions to the devil ride; Full many a riddle will be thereuntied.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííAy! and full many a riddle tied anew. But let the great world rave and riot!Here will we house ourselves in quiet. A custom 'tis of ancient date, Ourlesser worlds within the great world to create! Young witches there I see,naked and bare, And old ones, veil'd more prudently. For my sake onlycourteous be! The trouble's small, the sport is rare. Of instruments I hear thecursed din One must get used to it. Come in! come in! There's now no helpfor it. I'll step before And introducing you as my good friend, Confer on youone obligation more. How say you now? 'Tis no such paltry room; Why onlylook, you scarce can see the end. A hundred fires in rows disperse the gloom;They dance, they talk, they cook, make love, and drink: Where could we findaught better, do you think?

ííííFaust

ííííTo introduce us, do you purpose here As devil or as wizard to appear?Mephistopheles

ííííThough I am wont indeed to strict incognito, Yet upon gala - days one mustone's orders show. No garter have I to distinguish me, Nathless the clovenfoot doth here give dignity. Seest thou yonder snail? Crawling this way shehies: With searching feelers, she, no doubt, Hath me already scented out;Here, even if I would, for me there's no disguise. From fire to fire, we'llsaunter at our leisure, The gallant you, I'll cater for your pleasure.(To a party seated round some expiring embers.)Old gentleman, apart, why sit ye moping here? Ye in the midst should be of allthis jovial cheer, Girt round with noise and youthful riot; At home one surelyhas enough of quiet.

ííííGeneral

ííííIn nations put his trust, who may, Whate'er for them one may have done; Forwith the people, as with women, they Honour your rising stars alone!Minister

ííííNow all too far they wander from the right; I praise the good old ways, tothem I hold, Then was the genuine age of gold, When we ourselves wereforemost in men's sight.

ííííParvenu

ííííNe'er were we 'mong your dullards found, And what we ought not, that to dowere fair; Yet now are all things turning round and round, When on firm basiswe would them maintain.

ííííAuthor

ííííWho, as a rule, a treatise now would care To read, of even moderate sense?As for the rising generation, ne'er Has youth displayed such arrogantpretence.

ííííMephistopheles

íííí(suddenly appearing very old)

ííííSince for the last time I the Brocken scale, That folk are ripe for doomsday,now one sees; And just because my cask begins to fail, So the whole world isalso on the lees.

ííííHuckster - Witch

ííííStop, gentlemen, nor pass me by, Of wares I have a choice collection: Prayhonour them with your inspection. Lose not his opportunity! Yet nothing in mybooth you'll find Without its counterpart on earth; there's naught, Which to theworld, and to mankind, Hath not some direful mischief wrought. No daggerhere, which hath not flow'd with blood, No chalice, whence, into somehealthy frame Hath not been poured hot poison's wasting flood. No trinket,but hath wrought some woman's shame, No weapon but hath cut somesacred tie, Or from behind hath stabb'd an enemy.Mephistopheles

ííííGossip! For wares like these the time's gone by, What's done is past! what'spast is done! With novelties your booth supply; Us novelties attract alone.Faust

ííííMay this wild scene my senses spare! This, may in truth be called a fair!Mephistopheles

ííííUpward the eddying concourse throng; Thinking to push, thyself art push'dalong.

ííííFaust

ííííWho's that, pray?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííMark her well! That's Lilith.

ííííFaust

ííííWho?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííAdam's first wife. Of her rich locks beware! That charm in which she'sparallel'd by few; When in its toils a youth she doth ensnare, He will not soonescape, I promise you.

ííííFaust

ííííThere sit a pair, the old one with the young; Already they have bravelydanced and sprung!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííHere there is no repose to - day. Another dance begins; we'll join it, comeaway!

ííííFaust

íííí(dancing with the young one)

ííííOnce a fair vision came to me; There in I saw an apple - tree, Two beauteousapples charmed mine eyes; I climb'd forthwith to reach the prize.The Fair One

ííííApples still fondly ye desire, From paradise it hath been so. Feelings of joymy breast inspire That such too in my garden grow.Mephistopheles (with the old one)

ííííOnce a weird vision came to me; Therein I saw a rifted tree. It had a . . . . . . ;But as it was it pleased me too.

ííííThe Old One

ííííI beg most humbly to salute The gallant with the cloven foot! Let him a . . .have ready here, If he a . . . does not fear.

ííííProctophantasmist

ííííAccursed mob! How dare ye thus to meet? Have I not shown anddemonstrated too, That ghosts stand not on ordinary feet? Yet here ye dance,as other mortals do!

ííííThe Fair One (dancing)

ííííThen at our ball, what doth he here?

ííííFaust (dancing)

ííííOh! He must everywhere appear. He must adjudge, when others dance; If oneach step his say's not said, So is that step as good as never made. He's mostannoyed, so soon as we advance; If ye would circle in one narrow round, Ashe in his old mill, then doubtless he Your dancing would approve, - especiallyIf ye forthwith salute him with respect profound!Proctophantasmist

ííííStill here! what arrogance! unheard of quite! Vanish; we now have fill'd theworld with light! Laws are unheeded by the devil's host; Wise as we are, yetTegel hath its ghost! How long at this conceit I've swept with all my might,Lost is the labour: 'tis unheard of quite!

ííííThe Fair One

ííííCease here to teaze us any more, I pray.

ííííProctophantasmist

ííííSpirits, I plainly to your face declare: No spiritual control myself will bear,Since my own spirit can exert no sway.

íííí(The dancing continues.)

ííííTo - night, I see, I shall in naught succeed; But I'm prepar'd my travels topursue, And hope, before my final step indeed, To triumph over bards anddevils too.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííNow in some puddle will he take his station, Such is his mode of seekingconsolation; Where leeches, feasting on his rump, will drain Spirits alike andspirit from his brain.

íííí(To Faust, who has left the dance.)

ííííBut why the charming damsel leave, I pray, Who to you in the dance sosweetly sang?

ííííFaust

ííííAh, in the very middle of her lay, Out of her mouth a small red mouse theresprang.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííSuppose there did! One must not be too nice. 'Twas well it was not grey, letthat suffice. Who 'mid his pleasures for a trifle cares?Faust

ííííThen saw I

ííííMephistopheles

ííííWhat?

ííííFaust

ííííMephisto, seest thou there Standing far off, a lone child, pale and fair? Slowfrom the spot her drooping form she tears, And seems with shackled feet tomove along; I own, within me the delusion' strong, That she the likeness of myGretchen wears.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííGaze not upon her! 'Tis not good! Forbear! 'Tis lifeless, magical, a shape ofair, An idol. Such to meet with, bodes no good; That rigid look of hers dothfreeze man's blood, And well - nigh petrifies his heart to stone: The story ofMedusa thou hast known.

ííííFaust

ííííAy, verily! a corpse's eyes are those, Which there was no fond loving hand toclose. That is the bosom I so fondly press'd, That my sweet Gretchen's form,so oft caress'd!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííDeluded fool! 'Tis magic, I declare! To each she doth his lov'd one's imagewear.

ííííFaust

ííííWhat bliss! what torture! vainly I essay To turn me from that piteous lookaway. How strangely doth a single crimson line Around that lovely neck itscoil entwine, It shows no broader than a knife's blunt edge!Mephistopheles

ííííQuite right. I see it also, and allege That she beneath her arm her head canbear, Since Perseus cut it off. - But you I swear Are craving for illusion still!Come then, ascend yon little hill! As on the Prater all is gay, And if my sensesare not gone, I see a theatre, - what's going on?Servibilis

ííííThey are about to recommence; - the play Will be the last of seven, and spick- span new 'Tis usual here that number to present. A dilettante did the pieceinvent, And dilettanti will enact it too. Excuse me, gentlemen; to me's assign'dAs dilettante to uplift the curtain.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííYou on the Blocksberg I'm rejoiced to find, That 'tis your most appropriatesphere is certain.

ííííIn misery! despairing! long wandering pitifully on the face of the earth andnow imprisoned! This gentle hapless creature, immured in the dungeon as amalefactor and reserved for horrid tortures! That it should come to this! Tothis! - Perfidious, worthless spirit, and this thou hast concealed from me!Stand! ay, stand! roll in malicious rage thy fiendish eyes! Stand and brave mewith thine insupportable presence! Imprisoned! In hopeless misery! Deliveredover to the power of evil spirits and the judgment of unpitying humanity! Andme, the while, thou wert lulling with tasteless dissipations, concealing from meher growing anguish, and leaving her to perish without help!Mephistopheles

ííííShe is not the first.

ííííFaust

ííííHound! Execrable monster! - Back with him, oh thou infinite spirit! back withthe reptile into his dog's shape, in which it was his wont to scamper before meat eventide, to roll before the feet of the harmless wanderer, and to fasten onhis shoulders when he fell! Change him again into his favourite shape, that hemay crouch on his belly before me in the dust, whilst I spurn him with my foot,the reprobate! - Not the first! - Woe! Woe! By no human soul is itconceivable, that more than one human creature has ever sunk into a depth ofwretchedness like this, or that the first in her writhing death agony should nothave atoned in the sight of all - pardoning Heaven for the guilt of all the rest!The misery of this one pierces me to the very marrow, and harrows up mysoul; thou art grinning calmly over the doom of thousands!Mephistopheles

ííííNow we are once again at our wit's end, just where the reason of you mortalssnaps! Why dost thou seek our fellowship, if thou canst not go through withit? Wilt fly, and art not proof against dizziness? Did we force ourselves onthee, or thou on us?

ííííFaust

ííííCease thus to gnash thy ravenous fangs at me! I loathe thee! - Great andglorious spirit, thou who didst vouchsafe to reveal thyself unto me, thou whodost know my very heart and soul, why hast thou linked me with this baseassociate, who feeds on mischief and revels in destruction?Mephistopheles

ííííHast done?

ííííFaust

ííííSave her! - or woe to thee! The direst of curses on thee for thousands ofyears!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííI cannot loose the bands of the avenger, nor withdraw his bolts. - Save her! -Who was it plunged her into perdition? I or thou?(Faust looks wildly around.)

ííííMephistopheles

ííííWould'st grasp the thunder? Well for you, poor mortals, that 'tis not yours towield! To smite to atoms the being however innocent, who obstructs his path,such is the tyrant's fashion of relieving himself in difficulties!Faust

ííííConvey me thither! She shall be free!

ííííMephistopheles

ííííAnd the danger to which thou dost expose thyself? Know, the guilt of blood,shed by thy hand, lies yet upon the town. Over the place where fell themurdered one, avenging spirits hover and watch for the returning murderer.Faust

ííííThis too from thee? The death and downfall of a world be on thee, monster!Conduct me thither, I say, and set her free!

ííííI will conduct thee. And what I can do, - hear! Have I all power in heavenand upon earth! I'll cloud the senses of the warder, - do thou possess thyselfof the keys and lead her forth with human hand! I will keep watch! The magicsteeds are waiting, I bear thee off. Thus much is in my power.Faust

ííííWhat weave they yonder round the Ravenstone?

ííííMephistopheles

ííííI know not what they shape and brew.

ííííFaust

ííííThey're soaring, swooping, bending, stooping.

ííííMephistopheles

ííííA witche's pack.

ííííThey charm, they strew.

ííííFaust

íííí(with a bunch of keys and a lamp before a small iron door)A fear unwonted o'er my spirit falls; Man's concentrated woe o'erwhelms mehere! She dwells immur'd within these dripping walls; Her only trespass adelusion dear! Thou lingerest at the fatal door, Thou dread'st to see her faceonce more? On! While thou dalliest, draws her death - hour near.(He seizes the lock. Singing within.)

ííííMy mother, the harlot, She took me and slew! My father, the scoundrel, Hatheaten me too! My sweet little sister Hath all my bones laid, Where softbreezes whisper All in the cool shade!

ííííThen became I a wood - bird, and sang on the spray, Fly away! little bird, flyaway! fly away!

ííííFaust (opening the lock)

ííííAh! she forebodes not that her lover's near, The clanking chains, the rustlingstraw, to hear.

ííííMargaret

íííí(hiding her face in the bed of straw)

ííííWoe! woe! they come! on bitter 'tis to die!

ííííFaust (softly)

ííííHush! hush! be still! I come to set thee free!Margaret

íííí(throwing herself at his feet)

ííííIf thou art human, feel my misery!

ííííFaust

ííííThou wilt awake the jailor with thy cry!

íííí(He grasps the chains to unlock them.)

ííííMargaret (on her knees)

ííííWho, headsman, unto thee this power O'er me could give? Thou com'st forme at midnight - hour. Be merciful, and let me live! Is morrow's dawn not timeenough? (She stands up.)

ííííI'm still so young, so young And must so early die! Fair was I too, and thatwas my undoing. My love is now afar, he then was nigh; Torn lies the garland,the fair blossoms strew'd. Nay, seize me not with hand so rude! Spare me!What harm have I e'er done to thee? Oh let me not in vain implore! I ne'erhave seen thee in my life before!

ííííFaust

ííííCan I endure this bitter agony?

ííííMargaret

ííííI now am at thy mercy quite. Let me my babe but suckle once again! Ifondled it the live - long night; They took it from me but to give me pain, Andnow, they say that I my child have slain. Gladness I ne'er again shall know.Then they sing songs about me, - 'tis wicked of the throng An ancient balladendeth so; Who bade them thus apply the song?

ííííFaust

íííí(throwing himself on the ground)

ííííA lover at thy feet bends low, To loose the bonds of wretchedness and woe.Margaret

íííí(throws herself beside him)

ííííOh, let us kneel and move the saints by prayer! Look! look! yon stairs below,Under the threshold there, Hell's flames are all aglow! Beneath the floor, Withhideous noise, The devils roar!

ííííFaust (aloud)

ííííGretchen! Gretchen!

ííííMargaret (listening)

ííííThat was my lov'd one's voice!

íííí(She springs up, the chains fall off.)

ííííWhere is he? I heard him calling me. Free am I! There's none shall hinder me.To his neck will I fly, On his bosom will lie! Gretchen, he called! - On yonthreshold he stood; Amidst all the howling of hell's fiery flood, The scoff andthe scorn of its devilish crew, The tones of his voice, sweet and loving, Iknew.

ííííFaust

íííí'Tis I!

ííííMargaret

íííí'Tis thou! O say so once again!

íííí(embracing him.)

íííí'Tis he! 'Tis he! where's now the torturing pain? Where are the fetters? wherethe dungeon's gloom? 'Tis thou! To save me thou art come! And I am sav'd!Already now the street I see Where the first time I caught a glimpse of thee.There too the pleasant garden shade, Where I and Martha for thy comingstay'd.

ííííFaust

íííí(endeavouring to lead her away)

ííííCome! come away!

ííííMargaret

ííííOh do not haste!

ííííI love to linger where thou stayest. (caressing him.)Faust

ííííAh haste! For if thou still delayest, Our lingering we shall both deplore.Margaret

ííííHow, dearest? canst thou kiss no more! So short a time away from me, andyet, To kiss thou couldst so soon forget! Why on thy neck so anxious do Ifeel When formerly a perfect heaven of bliss From thy dear looks and wordswould o'er me steal? As thou wouldst stifle me thou then didst kiss! Kiss me!Or I'll kiss thee! (She embraces him.) Woe! woe! Thy lips are cold, Aredumb! Thy love where hast thou left? Who hath me of thy love bereft?(She turns away from him.)

ííííFaust

ííííCome! Follow me, my dearest love, be bold! I'll cherish thee with ardourthousand - fold; I but entreat thee now to follow me!Margaret

íííí(turning towards him)

ííííAnd art thou he? and art thou really he?

ííííFaust

íííí'Tis I! O come!

ííííMargaret

ííííThou wilt strike off my chain, And thou wilt take me to thine arms again. Howcomes it that thou dost not shrink from me? And dost thou know, love, whomthou wouldst set free?

ííííFaust

ííííCome! come! already night begins to wane.

ííííMargaret

ííííI sent my mother to her grave, I drown'd my child beneath the wave. Was itnot given to thee and me - thee too? 'Tis thou thyself! I scarce believe it yet.Give me thy hand! It is no dream! 'Tis true! Thine own dear hand! - But howis this? 'Tis wet? Quick, wipe it off! Meseems that yet There's blood thereon.Ah God! what hast thou done? Put up thy sword, I beg of thee!Faust

ííííOh, dearest, let the past forgotten be! Death is in every word.Margaret

ííííNo, thou must linger here in sorrow! The graves I will describe to thee, Andthou to them must see To - morrow: The best place give to my mother, Closeat her side my brother, Me at some distance lay But not too far away! Andthe little one place on my right breast, Nobody else will near me lie! To nestlebeside thee so lovingly, That was a rapture, gracious and sweet! A rapture Inever again shall prove; Methinks I would force myself on thee, love, Andthou dost spurn me, and back retreat Yet 'tis thyself, thy fond kind looks Isee.

ííííFaust

ííííIf thou dost feel 'tis I, then come with me!

ííííMargaret

ííííWhat, there? without?

ííííFaust

ííííYes, forth in the free air.

ííííMargaret

ííííAy, if the grave's without, - If death lurk there! Hence to the everlastingresting - place, And not one step beyond! - Thou'rt leaving me? Oh Henry!would that I could go with thee!

ííííFaust

ííííThou canst! But will it! Open stands the door.Margaret

ííííI dare not go! I've naught to hope for more. What boots it to escape? Theylurk for me! 'Tis wretched to beg, as I must do, And with an evil consciencethereto! 'Tis wretched, in foreign lands to stray; And me they will catch, dowhat I may!

ííííFaust

ííííWith thee will I abide.

ííííMargaret

ííííQuick! Quick! Save thy poor child! Keep to the path The brook along, Overthe bridge To the wood beyond, To the left, where the plank is, In the pond.Seize it at once! It fain would rise, It struggles still! Save it. Oh save!Faust

ííííDear Gretchen, more collected be! One little step, and thou art free!Margaret

ííííWere we but only past the hill! There sits my mother upon a stone My brain,alas, is cold with dread! There sits my mother upon a stone, And to and froshe shakes her head; She winks not, she nods not, her head it droops sore;She slept so long, she waked no more; She slept, that we might taste of bliss:Ah! those were happy times, I wis!

ííííFaust

ííííSince here avails nor argument nor prayer, Thee hence by force I needs mustbear.

ííííMargaret

ííííLoose me! I will not suffer violence! With murderous hand hold not so fast! Ihave done all to please thee in the past!

ííííFaust

ííííDay dawns! My love! My love!

ííííMargaret

ííííYes! day draws near. The day of judgment too will soon appear! It shouldhave been my bridal! No one tell, That thy poor Gretchen thou hast knowntoo well. Woe to my garland! Its bloom is o'er! Though not at the dance Weshall meet once more. The crowd doth gather, in silence it rolls; The squares,the streets, Scarce hold the throng. The staff is broken, - the death - bell tolls,They bind and seize me! I'm hurried along, To the seat of blood already I'mbound! Quivers each neck as the naked steel Quivers on mine the blow todeal The silence of the grave now broods around!Faust

ííííWould I had ne'er been born!

ííííMephistopheles (appears without)

ííííUp! or you're lost. Vain hesitation! Babbling, quaking! My steeds areshivering, Morn is breaking.

ííííMargaret

ííííWhat from the floor ascendeth like a ghost? 'Tis he! 'Tis he! Him from mypresence chase! What would he in this holy place? It is for me he cometh!Faust

ííííThou shalt live!

ííííMargaret

ííííJudgment of God! To thee my soul I give!

ííííCome, come! With her I'll else abandon thee!

ííííby Homer

íííítranslated by Samuel Butler

ííííBOOK I

ííííSing, O goddess, the anger of Achilles son of Peleus, that broughtcountless ills upon the Achaeans. Many a brave soul did it sendhurrying down to Hades, and many a hero did it yield a prey to dogsand vultures, for so were the counsels of Jove fulfilled from theday on which the son of Atreus, king of men, and great Achilles, firstfell out with one another.

ííííAnd which of the gods was it that set them on to quarrel? It was theson of Jove and Leto; for he was angry with the king and sent apestilence upon the host to plague the people, because the son ofAtreus had dishonoured Chryses his priest. Now Chryses had come to theships of the Achaeans to free his daughter, and had brought with him agreat ransom: moreover he bore in his hand the sceptre of Apollowreathed with a suppliant's wreath and he besought the Achaeans, butmost of all the two sons of Atreus, who were their chiefs.

íííí""Sons of Atreus,"" he cried, ""and all other Achaeans, may the godswho dwell in Olympus grant you to sack the city of Priam, and to reachyour homes in safety; but free my daughter, and accept a ransom forher, in reverence to Apollo, son of Jove.""

ííííOn this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were forrespecting the priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but notso Agamemnon, who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away.""Old man,"" said he, ""let me not find you tarrying about our ships, noryet coming hereafter. Your sceptre of the god and your wreath shallprofit you nothing. I will not free her. She shall grow old in myhouse at Argos far from her own home, busying herself with her loomand visiting my couch; so go, and do not provoke me or it shall be theworse for you.""

ííííThe old man feared him and obeyed. Not a word he spoke, but wentby the shore of the sounding sea and prayed apart to King Apollowhom lovely Leto had borne. ""Hear me,"" he cried, ""O god of thesilver bow, that protectest Chryse and holy Cilla and rulest Tenedoswith thy might, hear me oh thou of Sminthe. If I have ever decked yourtemple with garlands, or burned your thigh-bones in fat of bulls orgoats, grant my prayer, and let your arrows avenge these my tears uponthe Danaans.""

ííííThus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He came downfurious from the summits of Olympus, with his bow and his quiverupon his shoulder, and the arrows rattled on his back with the ragethat trembled within him. He sat himself down away from the ships witha face as dark as night, and his silver bow rang death as he shothis arrow in the midst of them. First he smote their mules and theirhounds, but presently he aimed his shafts at the people themselves,and all day long the pyres of the dead were burning.

ííííFor nine whole days he shot his arrows among the people, but uponthe tenth day Achilles called them in assembly- moved thereto by Juno,who saw the Achaeans in their death-throes and had compassion uponthem. Then, when they were got together, he rose and spoke among them.

íííí""Son of Atreus,"" said he, ""I deem that we should now turn rovinghome if we would escape destruction, for we are being cut down bywar and pestilence at once. Let us ask some priest or prophet, or somereader of dreams (for dreams, too, are of Jove) who can tell us whyPhoebus Apollo is so angry, and say whether it is for some vow that wehave broken, or hecatomb that we have not offered, and whether he willaccept the savour of lambs and goats without blemish, so as to takeaway the plague from us.""

ííííWith these words he sat down, and Calchas son of Thestor, wisestof augurs, who knew things past present and to come, rose to speak. Heit was who had guided the Achaeans with their fleet to Ilius,through the prophesyings with which Phoebus Apollo had inspired him.With all sincerity and goodwill he addressed them thus:-

íííí""Achilles, loved of heaven, you bid me tell you about the anger ofKing Apollo, I will therefore do so; but consider first and swear thatyou will stand by me heartily in word and deed, for I know that Ishall offend one who rules the Argives with might, to whom all theAchaeans are in subjection. A plain man cannot stand against the angerof a king, who if he swallow his displeasure now, will yet nurserevenge till he has wreaked it. Consider, therefore, whether or no youwill protect me.""

ííííAnd Achilles answered, ""Fear not, but speak as it is borne in uponyou from heaven, for by Apollo, Calchas, to whom you pray, and whoseoracles you reveal to us, not a Danaan at our ships shall lay his handupon you, while I yet live to look upon the face of the earth- no, notthough you name Agamemnon himself, who is by far the foremost of theAchaeans.""

ííííThereon the seer spoke boldly. ""The god,"" he said, ""is angry neitherabout vow nor hecatomb, but for his priest's sake, whom Agamemnonhas dishonoured, in that he would not free his daughter nor take aransom for her; therefore has he sent these evils upon us, and willyet send others. He will not deliver the Danaans from thispestilence till Agamemnon has restored the girl without fee orransom to her father, and has sent a holy hecatomb to Chryse. Thuswe may perhaps appease him.""

ííííWith these words he sat down, and Agamemnon rose in anger. His heartwas black with rage, and his eyes flashed fire as he scowled onCalchas and said, ""Seer of evil, you never yet prophesied smooththings concerning me, but have ever loved to foretell that which wasevil. You have brought me neither comfort nor performance; and now youcome seeing among Danaans, and saying that Apollo has plagued usbecause I would not take a ransom for this girl, the daughter ofChryses. I have set my heart on keeping her in my own house, for Ilove her better even than my own wife Clytemnestra, whose peer sheis alike in form and feature, in understanding and accomplishments.Still I will give her up if I must, for I would have the peoplelive, not die; but you must find me a prize instead, or I aloneamong the Argives shall be without one. This is not well; for youbehold, all of you, that my prize is to go elsewhither.""

ííííAnd Achilles answered, ""Most noble son of Atreus, covetous beyondall mankind, how shall the Achaeans find you another prize? We have nocommon store from which to take one. Those we took from the citieshave been awarded; we cannot disallow the awards that have been madealready. Give this girl, therefore, to the god, and if ever Jovegrants us to sack the city of Troy we will requite you three andfourfold.""

ííííThen Agamemnon said, ""Achilles, valiant though you be, you shall notthus outwit me. You shall not overreach and you shall not persuade me.Are you to keep your own prize, while I sit tamely under my loss andgive up the girl at your bidding? Let the Achaeans find me a prizein fair exchange to my liking, or I will come and take your own, orthat of Ajax or of Ulysses; and he to whomsoever I may come shallrue my coming. But of this we will take thought hereafter; for thepresent, let us draw a ship into the sea, and find a crew for herexpressly; let us put a hecatomb on board, and let us send Chryseisalso; further, let some chief man among us be in command, either Ajax,or Idomeneus, or yourself, son of Peleus, mighty warrior that you are,that we may offer sacrifice and appease the the anger of the god.""

ííííAchilles scowled at him and answered, ""You are steeped ininsolence and lust of gain. With what heart can any of the Achaeans doyour bidding, either on foray or in open fighting? I came notwarring here for any ill the Trojans had done me. I have no quarrelwith them. They have not raided my cattle nor my horses, nor cutdown my harvests on the rich plains of Phthia; for between me and themthere is a great space, both mountain and sounding sea. We havefollowed you, Sir Insolence! for your pleasure, not ours- to gainsatisfaction from the Trojans for your shameless self and forMenelaus. You forget this, and threaten to rob me of the prize forwhich I have toiled, and which the sons of the Achaeans have given me.Never when the Achaeans sack any rich city of the Trojans do I receiveso good a prize as you do, though it is my hands that do the betterpart of the fighting. When the sharing comes, your share is far thelargest, and I, forsooth, must go back to my ships, take what I canget and be thankful, when my labour of fighting is done. Now,therefore, I shall go back to Phthia; it will be much better for me toreturn home with my ships, for I will not stay here dishonoured togather gold and substance for you.""

ííííAnd Agamemnon answered, ""Fly if you will, I shall make you noprayers to stay you. I have others here who will do me honour, andabove all Jove, the lord of counsel. There is no king here sohateful to me as you are, for you are ever quarrelsome and illaffected. What though you be brave? Was it not heaven that made youso? Go home, then, with your ships and comrades to lord it over theMyrmidons. I care neither for you nor for your anger; and thus willI do: since Phoebus Apollo is taking Chryseis from me, I shall sendher with my ship and my followers, but I shall come to your tent andtake your own prize Briseis, that you may learn how much stronger I amthan you are, and that another may fear to set himself up as equalor comparable with me.""

ííííThe son of Peleus was furious, and his heart within his shaggybreast was divided whether to draw his sword, push the others aside,and kill the son of Atreus, or to restrain himself and check hisanger. While he was thus in two minds, and was drawing his mightysword from its scabbard, Minerva came down from heaven (for Juno hadsent her in the love she bore to them both), and seized the son ofPeleus by his yellow hair, visible to him alone, for of the othersno man could see her. Achilles turned in amaze, and by the fire thatflashed from her eyes at once knew that she was Minerva. ""Why areyou here,"" said he, ""daughter of aegis-bearing Jove? To see thepride of Agamemnon, son of Atreus? Let me tell you- and it shallsurely be- he shall pay for this insolence with his life.""

ííííAnd Minerva said, ""I come from heaven, if you will hear me, to bidyou stay your anger. Juno has sent me, who cares for both of youalike. Cease, then, this brawling, and do not draw your sword; rail athim if you will, and your railing will not be vain, for I tell you-and it shall surely be- that you shall hereafter receive gifts threetimes as splendid by reason of this present insult. Hold, therefore,and obey.""

íííí""Goddess,"" answered Achilles, ""however angry a man may be, he mustdo as you two command him. This will be best, for the gods ever hearthe prayers of him who has obeyed them.""

ííííHe stayed his hand on the silver hilt of his sword, and thrust itback into the scabbard as Minerva bade him. Then she went back toOlympus among the other gods, and to the house of aegis-bearing Jove.

ííííBut the son of Peleus again began railing at the son of Atreus,for he was still in a rage. ""Wine-bibber,"" he cried, ""with the face ofa dog and the heart of a hind, you never dare to go out with thehost in fight, nor yet with our chosen men in ambuscade. You shun thisas you do death itself. You had rather go round and rob his prizesfrom any man who contradicts you. You devour your people, for youare king over a feeble folk; otherwise, son of Atreus, henceforwardyou would insult no man. Therefore I say, and swear it with a greatoath- nay, by this my sceptre which shalt sprout neither leaf norshoot, nor bud anew from the day on which it left its parent stem uponthe mountains- for the axe stripped it of leaf and bark, and now thesons of the Achaeans bear it as judges and guardians of the decrees ofheaven- so surely and solemnly do I swear that hereafter they shalllook fondly for Achilles and shall not find him. In the day of yourdistress, when your men fall dying by the murderous hand of Hector,you shall not know how to help them, and shall rend your heart withrage for the hour when you offered insult to the bravest of theAchaeans.""

ííííWith this the son of Peleus dashed his gold-bestudded sceptre on theground and took his seat, while the son of Atreus was beginningfiercely from his place upon the other side. Then uprosesmooth-tongued Nestor, the facile speaker of the Pylians, and thewords fell from his lips sweeter than honey. Two generations of menborn and bred in Pylos had passed away under his rule, and he wasnow reigning over the third. With all sincerity and goodwill,therefore, he addressed them thus:-

íííí""Of a truth,"" he said, ""a great sorrow has befallen the Achaeanland. Surely Priam with his sons would rejoice, and the Trojans beglad at heart if they could hear this quarrel between you two, who areso excellent in fight and counsel. I am older than either of you;therefore be guided by me. Moreover I have been the familiar friend ofmen even greater than you are, and they did not disregard my counsels.Never again can I behold such men as Pirithous and Dryas shepherd ofhis people, or as Caeneus, Exadius, godlike Polyphemus, and Theseusson of Aegeus, peer of the immortals. These were the mightiest menever born upon this earth: mightiest were they, and when they foughtthe fiercest tribes of mountain savages they utterly overthrew them. Icame from distant Pylos, and went about among them, for they wouldhave me come, and I fought as it was in me to do. Not a man now livingcould withstand them, but they heard my words, and were persuaded bythem. So be it also with yourselves, for this is the more excellentway. Therefore, Agamemnon, though you be strong, take not this girlaway, for the sons of the Achaeans have already given her to Achilles;and you, Achilles, strive not further with the king, for no man who bythe grace of Jove wields a sceptre has like honour with Agamemnon. Youare strong, and have a goddess for your mother; but Agamemnon isstronger than you, for he has more people under him. Son of Atreus,check your anger, I implore you; end this quarrel with Achilles, whoin the day of battle is a tower of strength to the Achaeans.""

ííííAnd Agamemnon answered, ""Sir, all that you have said is true, butthis fellow must needs become our lord and master: he must be lordof all, king of all, and captain of all, and this shall hardly be.Granted that the gods have made him a great warrior, have they alsogiven him the right to speak with railing?""

ííííAchilles interrupted him. ""I should be a mean coward,"" he cried,""were I to give in to you in all things. Order other people about, notme, for I shall obey no longer. Furthermore I say- and lay my sayingto your heart- I shall fight neither you nor any man about thisgirl, for those that take were those also that gave. But of all elsethat is at my ship you shall carry away nothing by force. Try, thatothers may see; if you do, my spear shall be reddened with yourblood.""

ííííWhen they had quarrelled thus angrily, they rose, and broke up theassembly at the ships of the Achaeans. The son of Peleus went backto his tents and ships with the son of Menoetius and his company,while Agamemnon drew a vessel into the water and chose a crew oftwenty oarsmen. He escorted Chryseis on board and sent moreover ahecatomb for the god. And Ulysses went as captain.

ííííThese, then, went on board and sailed their ways over the sea. Butthe son of Atreus bade the people purify themselves; so theypurified themselves and cast their filth into the sea. Then theyoffered hecatombs of bulls and goats without blemish on the sea-shore,and the smoke with the savour of their sacrifice rose curling uptowards heaven.

ííííThus did they busy themselves throughout the host. But Agamemnon didnot forget the threat that he had made Achilles, and called his trustymessengers and squires Talthybius and Eurybates. ""Go,"" said he, ""tothe tent of Achilles, son of Peleus; take Briseis by the hand andbring her hither; if he will not give her I shall come with others andtake her- which will press him harder.""

ííííHe charged them straightly further and dismissed them, whereonthey went their way sorrowfully by the seaside, till they came tothe tents and ships of the Myrmidons. They found Achilles sitting byhis tent and his ships, and ill-pleased he was when he beheld them.They stood fearfully and reverently before him, and never a word didthey speak, but he knew them and said, ""Welcome, heralds, messengersof gods and men; draw near; my quarrel is not with you but withAgamemnon who has sent you for the girl Briseis. Therefore, Patroclus,bring her and give her to them, but let them be witnesses by theblessed gods, by mortal men, and by the fierceness of Agamemnon'sanger, that if ever again there be need of me to save the peoplefrom ruin, they shall seek and they shall not find. Agamemnon is madwith rage and knows not how to look before and after that the Achaeansmay fight by their ships in safety.""

ííííPatroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him. He brought Briseisfrom the tent and gave her over to the heralds, who took her with themto the ships of the Achaeans- and the woman was loth to go. ThenAchilles went all alone by the side of the hoar sea, weeping andlooking out upon the boundless waste of waters. He raised his hands inprayer to his immortal mother, ""Mother,"" he cried, ""you bore me doomedto live but for a little season; surely Jove, who thunders fromOlympus, might have made that little glorious. It is not so.Agamemnon, son of Atreus, has done me dishonour, and has robbed meof my prize by force.""

ííííAs he spoke he wept aloud, and his mother heard him where she wassitting in the depths of the sea hard by the old man her father.Forthwith she rose as it were a grey mist out of the waves, sat downbefore him as he stood weeping, caressed him with her hand, andsaid, ""My son, why are you weeping? What is it that grieves you?Keep it not from me, but tell me, that we may know it together.""

ííííAchilles drew a deep sigh and said, ""You know it; why tell youwhat you know well already? We went to Thebe the strong city ofEetion, sacked it, and brought hither the spoil. The sons of theAchaeans shared it duly among themselves, and chose lovely Chryseis asthe meed of Agamemnon; but Chryses, priest of Apollo, came to theships of the Achaeans to free his daughter, and brought with him agreat ransom: moreover he bore in his hand the sceptre of Apollo,wreathed with a suppliant's wreath, and he besought the Achaeans,but most of all the two sons of Atreus who were their chiefs.

íííí""On this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for respectingthe priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not soAgamemnon, who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. Sohe went back in anger, and Apollo, who loved him dearly, heard hisprayer. Then the god sent a deadly dart upon the Argives, and thepeople died thick on one another, for the arrows went everywhitheramong the wide host of the Achaeans. At last a seer in the fulnessof his knowledge declared to us the oracles of Apollo, and I wasmyself first to say that we should appease him. Whereon the son ofAtreus rose in anger, and threatened that which he has since done. TheAchaeans are now taking the girl in a ship to Chryse, and sendinggifts of sacrifice to the god; but the heralds have just taken from mytent the daughter of Briseus, whom the Achaeans had awarded to myself.

íííí""Help your brave son, therefore, if you are able. Go to Olympus, andif you have ever done him service in word or deed, implore the aidof Jove. Ofttimes in my father's house have I heard you glory inthat you alone of the immortals saved the son of Saturn from ruin,when the others, with Juno, Neptune, and Pallas Minerva would have puthim in bonds. It was you, goddess, who delivered him by calling toOlympus the hundred-handed monster whom gods call Briareus, but menAegaeon, for he is stronger even than his father; when therefore hetook his seat all-glorious beside the son of Saturn, the other godswere afraid, and did not bind him. Go, then, to him, remind him of allthis, clasp his knees, and bid him give succour to the Trojans. Letthe Achaeans be hemmed in at the sterns of their ships, and perishon the sea-shore, that they may reap what joy they may of theirking, and that Agamemnon may rue his blindness in offering insult tothe foremost of the Achaeans.""

ííííThetis wept and answered, ""My son, woe is me that I should haveborne or suckled you. Would indeed that you had lived your span freefrom all sorrow at your ships, for it is all too brief; alas, that youshould be at once short of life and long of sorrow above your peers:woe, therefore, was the hour in which I bore you; nevertheless Iwill go to the snowy heights of Olympus, and tell this tale to Jove,if he will hear our prayer: meanwhile stay where you are with yourships, nurse your anger against the Achaeans, and hold aloof fromfight. For Jove went yesterday to Oceanus, to a feast among theEthiopians, and the other gods went with him. He will return toOlympus twelve days hence; I will then go to his mansion paved withbronze and will beseech him; nor do I doubt that I shall be able topersuade him.""

ííííOn this she left him, still furious at the loss of her that had beentaken from him. Meanwhile Ulysses reached Chryse with the hecatomb.When they had come inside the harbour they furled the sails and laidthem in the ship's hold; they slackened the forestays, lowered themast into its place, and rowed the ship to the place where theywould have her lie; there they cast out their mooring-stones andmade fast the hawsers. They then got out upon the sea-shore and landedthe hecatomb for Apollo; Chryseis also left the ship, and Ulyssesled her to the altar to deliver her into the hands of her father.""Chryses,"" said he, ""King Agamemnon has sent me to bring you back yourchild, and to offer sacrifice to Apollo on behalf of the Danaans, thatwe may propitiate the god, who has now brought sorrow upon theArgives.""

ííííSo saying he gave the girl over to her father, who received hergladly, and they ranged the holy hecatomb all orderly round thealtar of the god. They washed their hands and took up thebarley-meal to sprinkle over the victims, while Chryses lifted uphis hands and prayed aloud on their behalf. ""Hear me,"" he cried, ""Ogod of the silver bow, that protectest Chryse and holy Cilla, andrulest Tenedos with thy might. Even as thou didst hear me aforetimewhen I prayed, and didst press hardly upon the Achaeans, so hear meyet again, and stay this fearful pestilence from the Danaans.""

ííííThus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. When they had donepraying and sprinkling the barley-meal, they drew back the heads ofthe victims and killed and flayed them. They cut out thethigh-bones, wrapped them round in two layers of fat, set somepieces of raw meat on the top of them, and then Chryses laid them onthe wood fire and poured wine over them, while the young men stoodnear him with five-pronged spits in their hands. When thethigh-bones were burned and they had tasted the inward meats, they cutthe rest up small, put the pieces upon the spits, roasted them tillthey were done, and drew them off: then, when they had finishedtheir work and the feast was ready, they ate it, and every man had hisfull share, so that all were satisfied. As soon as they had had enoughto eat and drink, pages filled the mixing-bowl with wine and water andhanded it round, after giving every man his drink-offering.

ííííThus all day long the young men worshipped the god with song,hymning him and chaunting the joyous paean, and the god tookpleasure in their voices; but when the sun went down, and it came ondark, they laid themselves down to sleep by the stern cables of theship, and when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared theyagain set sail for the host of the Achaeans. Apollo sent them a fairwind, so they raised their mast and hoisted their white sails aloft.As the sail bellied with the wind the ship flew through the deepblue water, and the foam hissed against her bows as she sped onward.When they reached the wide-stretching host of the Achaeans, theydrew the vessel ashore, high and dry upon the sands, set her strongprops beneath her, and went their ways to their own tents and ships.

ííííBut Achilles abode at his ships and nursed his anger. He went not tothe honourable assembly, and sallied not forth to fight, but gnawed athis own heart, pining for battle and the war-cry.

ííííNow after twelve days the immortal gods came back in a body toOlympus, and Jove led the way. Thetis was not unmindful of thecharge her son had laid upon her, so she rose from under the sea andwent through great heaven with early morning to Olympus, where shefound the mighty son of Saturn sitting all alone upon its topmostridges. She sat herself down before him, and with her left hand seizedhis knees, while with her right she caught him under the chin, andbesought him, saying-

íííí""Father Jove, if I ever did you service in word or deed among theimmortals, hear my prayer, and do honour to my son, whose life is tobe cut short so early. King Agamemnon has dishonoured him by takinghis prize and keeping her. Honour him then yourself, Olympian lordof counsel, and grant victory to the Trojans, till the Achaeans givemy son his due and load him with riches in requital.""

ííííJove sat for a while silent, and without a word, but Thetis stillkept firm hold of his knees, and besought him a second time.""Incline your head,"" said she, ""and promise me surely, or else denyme- for you have nothing to fear- that I may learn how greatly youdisdain me.""

ííííAt this Jove was much troubled and answered, ""I shall have troubleif you set me quarrelling with Juno, for she will provoke me withher taunting speeches; even now she is always railing at me before theother gods and accusing me of giving aid to the Trojans. Go backnow, lest she should find out. I will consider the matter, and willbring it about as wish. See, I incline my head that you believe me.This is the most solemn that I can give to any god. I never recallmy word, or deceive, or fail to do what I say, when I have nodded myhead.""

ííííAs he spoke the son of Saturn bowed his dark brows, and theambrosial locks swayed on his immortal head, till vast Olympus reeled.

ííííWhen the pair had thus laid their plans, they parted- Jove to hishouse, while the goddess quitted the splendour of Olympus, and plungedinto the depths of the sea. The gods rose from their seats, before thecoming of their sire. Not one of them dared to remain sitting, but allstood up as he came among them. There, then, he took his seat. ButJuno, when she saw him, knew that he and the old merman's daughter,silver-footed Thetis, had been hatching mischief, so she at once beganto upbraid him. ""Trickster,"" she cried, ""which of the gods have youbeen taking into your counsels now? You are always settling matters insecret behind my back, and have never yet told me, if you could helpit, one word of your intentions.""

íííí""Juno,"" replied the sire of gods and men, ""you must not expect to beinformed of all my counsels. You are my wife, but you would find ithard to understand them. When it is proper for you to hear, there isno one, god or man, who will be told sooner, but when I mean to keep amatter to myself, you must not pry nor ask questions.""

íííí""Dread son of Saturn,"" answered Juno, ""what are you talking about?I? Pry and ask questions? Never. I let you have your own way ineverything. Still, I have a strong misgiving that the old merman'sdaughter Thetis has been talking you over, for she was with you andhad hold of your knees this self-same morning. I believe, therefore,that you have been promising her to give glory to Achilles, and tokill much people at the ships of the Achaeans.""

íííí""Wife,"" said Jove, ""I can do nothing but you suspect me and findit out. You will take nothing by it, for I shall only dislike youthe more, and it will go harder with you. Granted that it is as yousay; I mean to have it so; sit down and hold your tongue as I bidyou for if I once begin to lay my hands about you, though all heavenwere on your side it would profit you nothing.""

ííííOn this Juno was frightened, so she curbed her stubborn will and satdown in silence. But the heavenly beings were disquieted throughoutthe house of Jove, till the cunning workman Vulcan began to try andpacify his mother Juno. ""It will be intolerable,"" said he, ""if you twofall to wrangling and setting heaven in an uproar about a pack ofmortals. If such ill counsels are to prevail, we shall have nopleasure at our banquet. Let me then advise my mother- and she mustherself know that it will be better- to make friends with my dearfather Jove, lest he again scold her and disturb our feast. If theOlympian Thunderer wants to hurl us all from our seats, he can doso, for he is far the strongest, so give him fair words, and he willthen soon be in a good humour with us.""

ííííAs he spoke, he took a double cup of nectar, and placed it in hismother's hand. ""Cheer up, my dear mother,"" said he, ""and make the bestof it. I love you dearly, and should be very sorry to see you get athrashing; however grieved I might be, I could not help for there isno standing against Jove. Once before when I was trying to help you,he caught me by the foot and flung me from the heavenly threshold. Allday long from morn till eve, was I falling, till at sunset I came toground in the island of Lemnos, and there I lay, with very little lifeleft in me, till the Sintians came and tended me.""

ííííJuno smiled at this, and as she smiled she took the cup from herson's hands. Then Vulcan drew sweet nectar from the mixing-bowl, andserved it round among the gods, going from left to right; and theblessed gods laughed out a loud applause as they saw him ingbustling about the heavenly mansion.

ííííThus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun theyfeasted, and every one had his full share, so that all were satisfied.Apollo struck his lyre, and the Muses lifted up their sweet voices,calling and answering one another. But when the sun's glorious lighthad faded, they went home to bed, each in his own abode, which lameVulcan with his consummate skill had fashioned for them. So Jove,the Olympian Lord of Thunder, hied him to the bed in which he alwaysslept; and when he had got on to it he went to sleep, with Juno of thegolden throne by his side.

ííííBOOK II

ííííNow the other gods and the armed warriors on the plain sleptsoundly, but Jove was wakeful, for he was thinking how to do honour toAchilles, and destroyed much people at the ships of the Achaeans. Inthe end he deemed it would be best to send a lying dream to KingAgamemnon; so he called one to him and said to it, ""Lying Dream, go tothe ships of the Achaeans, into the tent of Agamemnon, and say tohim word to word as I now bid you. Tell him to get the Achaeansinstantly under arms, for he shall take Troy. There are no longerdivided counsels among the gods; Juno has brought them to her ownmind, and woe betides the Trojans.""

ííííThe dream went when it had heard its message, and soon reached theships of the Achaeans. It sought Agamemnon son of Atreus and found himin his tent, wrapped in a profound slumber. It hovered over his headin the likeness of Nestor, son of Neleus, whom Agamemnon honouredabove all his councillors, and said:-

íííí""You are sleeping, son of Atreus; one who has the welfare of hishost and so much other care upon his shoulders should dock hissleep. Hear me at once, for I come as a messenger from Jove, who,though he be not near, yet takes thought for you and pities you. Hebids you get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for you shall takeTroy. There are no longer divided counsels among the gods; Juno hasbrought them over to her own mind, and woe betides the Trojans atthe hands of Jove. Remember this, and when you wake see that it doesnot escape you.""

ííííThe dream then left him, and he thought of things that were,surely not to be accomplished. He thought that on that same day he wasto take the city of Priam, but he little knew what was in the mindof Jove, who had many another hard-fought fight in store alike forDanaans and Trojans. Then presently he woke, with the divine messagestill ringing in his ears; so he sat upright, and put on his softshirt so fair and new, and over this his heavy cloak. He bound hissandals on to his comely feet, and slung his silver-studded swordabout his shoulders; then he took the imperishable staff of hisfather, and sallied forth to the ships of the Achaeans.

ííííThe goddess Dawn now wended her way to vast Olympus that she mightherald day to Jove and to the other immortals, and Agamemnon sentthe criers round to call the people in assembly; so they called themand the people gathered thereon. But first he summoned a meeting ofthe elders at the ship of Nestor king of Pylos, and when they wereassembled he laid a cunning counsel before them.

íííí""My friends,"" said he, ""I have had a dream from heaven in the deadof night, and its face and figure resembled none but Nestor's. Ithovered over my head and said, 'You are sleeping, son of Atreus; onewho has the welfare of his host and so much other care upon hisshoulders should dock his sleep. Hear me at once, for I am a messengerfrom Jove, who, though he be not near, yet takes thought for you andpities you. He bids you get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for youshall take Troy. There are no longer divided counsels among thegods; Juno has brought them over to her own mind, and woe betidesthe Trojans at the hands of Jove. Remember this.' The dream thenvanished and I awoke. Let us now, therefore, arm the sons of theAchaeans. But it will be well that I should first sound them, and tothis end I will tell them to fly with their ships; but do you othersgo about among the host and prevent their doing so.""

ííííHe then sat down, and Nestor the prince of Pylos with allsincerity and goodwill addressed them thus: ""My friends,"" said he,""princes and councillors of the Argives, if any other man of theAchaeans had told us of this dream we should have declared it false,and would have had nothing to do with it. But he who has seen it isthe foremost man among us; we must therefore set about getting thepeople under arms.""

ííííWith this he led the way from the assembly, and the other sceptredkings rose with him in obedience to the word of Agamemnon; but thepeople pressed forward to hear. They swarmed like bees that sally fromsome hollow cave and flit in countless throng among the springflowers, bunched in knots and clusters; even so did the mightymultitude pour from ships and tents to the assembly, and rangethemselves upon the wide-watered shore, while among them ranWildfire Rumour, messenger of Jove, urging them ever to the fore. Thusthey gathered in a pell-mell of mad confusion, and the earth groanedunder the tramp of men as the people sought their places. Nine heraldswent crying about among them to stay their tumult and bid themlisten to the kings, till at last they were got into their severalplaces and ceased their clamour. Then King Agamemnon rose, holding hissceptre. This was the work of Vulcan, who gave it to Jove the son ofSaturn. Jove gave it to Mercury, slayer of Argus, guide andguardian. King Mercury gave it to Pelops, the mighty charioteer, andPelops to Atreus, shepherd of his people. Atreus, when he died, leftit to Thyestes, rich in flocks, and Thyestes in his turn left it to beborne by Agamemnon, that he might be lord of all Argos and of theisles. Leaning, then, on his sceptre, he addressed the Argives.

íííí""My friends,"" he said, ""heroes, servants of Mars, the hand of heavenhas been laid heavily upon me. Cruel Jove gave me his solemn promisethat I should sack the city of Priam before returning, but he hasplayed me false, and is now bidding me go ingloriously back to Argoswith the loss of much people. Such is the will of Jove, who has laidmany a proud city in the dust, as he will yet lay others, for hispower is above all. It will be a sorry tale hereafter that anAchaean host, at once so great and valiant, battled in vain againstmen fewer in number than themselves; but as yet the end is not insight. Think that the Achaeans and Trojans have sworn to a solemncovenant, and that they have each been numbered- the Trojans by theroll of their householders, and we by companies of ten; thinkfurther that each of our companies desired to have a Trojanhouseholder to pour out their wine; we are so greatly more in numberthat full many a company would have to go without its cup-bearer.But they have in the town allies from other places, and it is thesethat hinder me from being able to sack the rich city of Ilius. Nine ofJove years are gone; the timbers of our ships have rotted; theirtackling is sound no longer. Our wives and little ones at home lookanxiously for our coming, but the work that we came hither to do hasnot been done. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say: let us sailback to our own land, for we shall not take Troy.""

ííííWith these words he moved the hearts of the multitude, so many ofthem as knew not the cunning counsel of Agamemnon. They surged toand fro like the waves of the Icarian Sea, when the east and southwinds break from heaven's clouds to lash them; or as when the westwind sweeps over a field of corn and the ears bow beneath the blast,even so were they swayed as they flew with loud cries towards theships, and the dust from under their feet rose heavenward. Theycheered each other on to draw the ships into the sea; they cleared thechannels in front of them; they began taking away the stays fromunderneath them, and the welkin rang with their glad cries, so eagerwere they to return.

ííííThen surely the Argives would have returned after a fashion that wasnot fated. But Juno said to Minerva, ""Alas, daughter ofaegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, shall the Argives fly home to theirown land over the broad sea, and leave Priam and the Trojans the gloryof still keeping Helen, for whose sake so many of the Achaeans havedied at Troy, far from their homes? Go about at once among the host,and speak fairly to them, man by man, that they draw not their shipsinto the sea.""

ííííMinerva was not slack to do her bidding. Down she darted from thetopmost summits of Olympus, and in a moment she was at the ships ofthe Achaeans. There she found Ulysses, peer of Jove in counsel,standing alone. He had not as yet laid a hand upon his ship, for hewas grieved and sorry; so she went close up to him and said, ""Ulysses,noble son of Laertes, are you going to fling yourselves into yourships and be off home to your own land in this way? Will you leavePriam and the Trojans the glory of still keeping Helen, for whose sakeso many of the Achaeans have died at Troy, far from their homes? Goabout at once among the host, and speak fairly to them, man by man,that they draw not their ships into the sea.""

ííííUlysses knew the voice as that of the goddess: he flung his cloakfrom him and set off to run. His servant Eurybates, a man of Ithaca,who waited on him, took charge of the cloak, whereon Ulysses wentstraight up to Agamemnon and received from him his ancestral,imperishable staff. With this he went about among the ships of theAchaeans.

ííííWhenever he met a king or chieftain, he stood by him and spoke himfairly. ""Sir,"" said he, ""this flight is cowardly and unworthy. Standto your post, and bid your people also keep their places. You do notyet know the full mind of Agamemnon; he was sounding us, and erelong will visit the Achaeans with his displeasure. We were not allof us at the council to hear what he then said; see to it lest he beangry and do us a mischief; for the pride of kings is great, and thehand of Jove is with them.""

ííííBut when he came across any common man who was making a noise, hestruck him with his staff and rebuked him, saying, ""Sirrah, holdyour peace, and listen to better men than yourself. You are a cowardand no soldier; you are nobody either in fight or council; we cannotall be kings; it is not well that there should be many masters; oneman must be supreme- one king to whom the son of scheming Saturn hasgiven the sceptre of sovereignty over you all.""

ííííThus masterfully did he go about among the host, and the peoplehurried back to the council from their tents and ships with a sound asthe thunder of surf when it comes crashing down upon the shore, andall the sea is in an uproar.

ííííThe rest now took their seats and kept to their own severalplaces, but Thersites still went on wagging his unbridled tongue- aman of many words, and those unseemly; a monger of sedition, arailer against all who were in authority, who cared not what hesaid, so that he might set the Achaeans in a laugh. He was the ugliestman of all those that came before Troy- bandy-legged, lame of onefoot, with his two shoulders rounded and hunched over his chest. Hishead ran up to a point, but there was little hair on the top of it.Achilles and Ulysses hated him worst of all, for it was with them thathe was most wont to wrangle; now, however, with a shrill squeaky voicehe began heaping his abuse on Agamemnon. The Achaeans were angry anddisgusted, yet none the less he kept on brawling and bawling at theson of Atreus.

íííí""Agamemnon,"" he cried, ""what ails you now, and what more do youwant? Your tents are filled with bronze and with fair women, forwhenever we take a town we give you the pick of them. Would you haveyet more gold, which some Trojan is to give you as a ransom for hisson, when I or another Achaean has taken him prisoner? or is it someyoung girl to hide and lie with? It is not well that you, the ruler ofthe Achaeans, should bring them into such misery. Weakling cowards,women rather than men, let us sail home, and leave this fellow here atTroy to stew in his own meeds of honour, and discover whether wewere of any service to him or no. Achilles is a much better man thanhe is, and see how he has treated him- robbing him of his prize andkeeping it himself. Achilles takes it meekly and shows no fight; if hedid, son of Atreus, you would never again insult him.""

ííííThus railed Thersites, but Ulysses at once went up to him andrebuked him sternly. ""Check your glib tongue, Thersites,"" said be,""and babble not a word further. Chide not with princes when you havenone to back you. There is no viler creature come before Troy with thesons of Atreus. Drop this chatter about kings, and neither revile themnor keep harping about going home. We do not yet know how things aregoing to be, nor whether the Achaeans are to return with goodsuccess or evil. How dare you gibe at Agamemnon because the Danaanshave awarded him so many prizes? I tell you, therefore- and it shallsurely be- that if I again catch you talking such nonsense, I willeither forfeit my own head and be no more called father of Telemachus,or I will take you, strip you stark naked, and whip you out of theassembly till you go blubbering back to the ships.""

ííííOn this he beat him with his staff about the back and shoulders tillhe dropped and fell a-weeping. The golden sceptre raised a bloody wealon his back, so he sat down frightened and in pain, looking foolish ashe wiped the tears from his eyes. The people were sorry for him, yetthey laughed heartily, and one would turn to his neighbour saying,""Ulysses has done many a good thing ere now in fight and council,but he never did the Argives a better turn than when he stopped thisfellow's mouth from prating further. He will give the kings no more ofhis insolence.""

ííííThus said the people. Then Ulysses rose, sceptre in hand, andMinerva in the likeness of a herald bade the people be still, thatthose who were far off might hear him and consider his council. Hetherefore with all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus:-

íííí""King Agamemnon, the Achaeans are for making you a by-word among allmankind. They forget the promise they made you when they set outfrom Argos, that you should not return till you had sacked the town ofTroy, and, like children or widowed women, they murmur and would setoff homeward. True it is that they have had toil enough to bedisheartened. A man chafes at having to stay away from his wife evenfor a single month, when he is on shipboard, at the mercy of windand sea, but it is now nine long years that we have been kept here;I cannot, therefore, blame the Achaeans if they turn restive; still weshall be shamed if we go home empty after so long a stay- therefore,my friends, be patient yet a little longer that we may learn whetherthe prophesyings of Calchas were false or true.

íííí""All who have not since perished must remember as though it wereyesterday or the day before, how the ships of the Achaeans weredetained in Aulis when we were on our way hither to make war onPriam and the Trojans. We were ranged round about a fountainoffering hecatombs to the gods upon their holy altars, and there was afine plane-tree from beneath which there welled a stream of purewater. Then we saw a prodigy; for Jove sent a fearful serpent out ofthe ground, with blood-red stains upon its back, and it darted fromunder the altar on to the plane-tree. Now there was a brood of youngsparrows, quite small, upon the topmost bough, peeping out fromunder the leaves, eight in all, and their mother that hatched themmade nine. The serpent ate the poor cheeping things, while the oldbird flew about lamenting her little ones; but the serpent threw hiscoils about her and caught her by the wing as she was screaming. Then,when he had eaten both the sparrow and her young, the god who had senthim made him become a sign; for the son of scheming Saturn turnedhim into stone, and we stood there wondering at that which had come topass. Seeing, then, that such a fearful portent had broken in upon ourhecatombs, Calchas forthwith declared to us the oracles of heaven.'Why, Achaeans,' said he, 'are you thus speechless? Jove has sent usthis sign, long in coming, and long ere it be fulfilled, though itsfame shall last for ever. As the serpent ate the eight fledglingsand the sparrow that hatched them, which makes nine, so shall we fightnine years at Troy, but in the tenth shall take the town.' This waswhat he said, and now it is all coming true. Stay here, therefore, allof you, till we take the city of Priam.""

ííííOn this the Argives raised a shout, till the ships rang again withthe uproar. Nestor, knight of Gerene, then addressed them. ""Shame onyou,"" he cried, ""to stay talking here like children, when you shouldfight like men. Where are our covenants now, and where the oathsthat we have taken? Shall our counsels be flung into the fire, withour drink-offerings and the right hands of fellowship wherein wehave put our trust? We waste our time in words, and for all ourtalking here shall be no further forward. Stand, therefore, son ofAtreus, by your own steadfast purpose; lead the Argives on tobattle, and leave this handful of men to rot, who scheme, and schemein vain, to get back to Argos ere they have learned whether Jove betrue or a liar. For the mighty son of Saturn surely promised that weshould succeed, when we Argives set sail to bring death anddestruction upon the Trojans. He showed us favourable signs byflashing his lightning on our right hands; therefore let none makehaste to go till he has first lain with the wife of some Trojan, andavenged the toil and sorrow that he has suffered for the sake ofHelen. Nevertheless, if any man is in such haste to be at homeagain, let him lay his hand to his ship that he may meet his doom inthe sight of all. But, O king, consider and give ear to my counsel,for the word that I say may not be neglected lightly. Divide your men,Agamemnon, into their several tribes and clans, that clans andtribes may stand by and help one another. If you do this, and if theAchaeans obey you, you will find out who, both chiefs and peoples, arebrave, and who are cowards; for they will vie against the other.Thus you shall also learn whether it is through the counsel ofheaven or the cowardice of man that you shall fail to take the town.""

ííííAnd Agamemnon answered, ""Nestor, you have again outdone the sonsof the Achaeans in counsel. Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, andApollo, that I had among them ten more such councillors, for thecity of King Priam would then soon fall beneath our hands, and weshould sack it. But the son of Saturn afflicts me with bootlesswranglings and strife. Achilles and I are quarrelling about this girl,in which matter I was the first to offend; if we can be of one mindagain, the Trojans will not stave off destruction for a day. Now,therefore, get your morning meal, that our hosts join in fight. Whetwell your spears; see well to the ordering of your shields; givegood feeds to your horses, and look your chariots carefully over, thatwe may do battle the livelong day; for we shall have no rest, notfor a moment, till night falls to part us. The bands that bear yourshields shall be wet with the sweat upon your shoulders, your handsshall weary upon your spears, your horses shall steam in front of yourchariots, and if I see any man shirking the fight, or trying to keepout of it at the ships, there shall be no help for him, but he shallbe a prey to dogs and vultures.""

ííííThus he spoke, and the Achaeans roared applause. As when the wavesrun high before the blast of the south wind and break on some loftyheadland, dashing against it and buffeting it without ceasing, asthe storms from every quarter drive them, even so did the Achaeansrise and hurry in all directions to their ships. There they lightedtheir fires at their tents and got dinner, offering sacrifice everyman to one or other of the gods, and praying each one of them thathe might live to come out of the fight. Agamemnon, king of men,sacrificed a fat five-year-old bull to the mighty son of Saturn, andinvited the princes and elders of his host. First he asked Nestorand King Idomeneus, then the two Ajaxes and the son of Tydeus, andsixthly Ulysses, peer of gods in counsel; but Menelaus came of his ownaccord, for he knew how busy his brother then was. They stood roundthe bull with the barley-meal in their hands, and Agamemnon prayed,saying, ""Jove, most glorious, supreme, that dwellest in heaven, andridest upon the storm-cloud, grant that the sun may not go down, northe night fall, till the palace of Priam is laid low, and its gatesare consumed with fire. Grant that my sword may pierce the shirt ofHector about his heart, and that full many of his comrades may bitethe dust as they fall dying round him.""

ííííThus he prayed, but the son of Saturn would not fulfil his prayer.He accepted the sacrifice, yet none the less increased their toilcontinually. When they had done praying and sprinkling the barley-mealupon the victim, they drew back its head, killed it, and then flayedit. They cut out the thigh-bones, wrapped them round in two layersof fat, and set pieces of raw meat on the top of them. These theyburned upon the split logs of firewood, but they spitted the inwardmeats, and held them in the flames to cook. When the thigh-boneswere burned, and they had tasted the inward meats, they cut the restup small, put the pieces upon spits, roasted them till they were done,and drew them off; then, when they had finished their work and thefeast was ready, they ate it, and every man had his full share, sothat all were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough to eat anddrink, Nestor, knight of Gerene, began to speak. ""King Agamemnon,""said he, ""let us not stay talking here, nor be slack in the workthat heaven has put into our hands. Let the heralds summon thepeople to gather at their several ships; we will then go about amongthe host, that we may begin fighting at once.""

ííííThus did he speak, and Agamemnon heeded his words. He at once sentthe criers round to call the people in assembly. So they calledthem, and the people gathered thereon. The chiefs about the son ofAtreus chose their men and marshalled them, while Minerva went amongthem holding her priceless aegis that knows neither age nor death.From it there waved a hundred tassels of pure gold, all deftlywoven, and each one of them worth a hundred oxen. With this she dartedfuriously everywhere among the hosts of the Achaeans, urging themforward, and putting courage into the heart of each, so that hemight fight and do battle without ceasing. Thus war became sweeterin their eyes even than returning home in their ships. As when somegreat forest fire is raging upon a mountain top and its light isseen afar, even so as they marched the gleam of their armour flashedup into the firmament of heaven.

ííííThey were like great flocks of geese, or cranes, or swans on theplain about the waters of Cayster, that wing their way hither andthither, glorying in the pride of flight, and crying as they settletill the fen is alive with their screaming. Even thus did their tribespour from ships and tents on to the plain of the Scamander, and theground rang as brass under the feet of men and horses. They stood asthick upon the flower-bespangled field as leaves that bloom in summer.

ííííAs countless swarms of flies buzz around a herdsman's homestead inthe time of spring when the pails are drenched with milk, even sodid the Achaeans swarm on to the plain to charge the Trojans anddestroy them.

ííííThe chiefs disposed their men this way and that before the fightbegan, drafting them out as easily as goatherds draft their flockswhen they have got mixed while feeding; and among them went KingAgamemnon, with a head and face like Jove the lord of thunder, a waistlike Mars, and a chest like that of Neptune. As some great bull thatlords it over the herds upon the plain, even so did Jove make theson of Atreus stand peerless among the multitude of heroes.

ííííAnd now, O Muses, dwellers in the mansions of Olympus, tell me-for you are goddesses and are in all places so that you see allthings, while we know nothing but by report- who were the chiefs andprinces of the Danaans? As for the common soldiers, they were sothat I could not name every single one of them though I had tentongues, and though my voice failed not and my heart were of bronzewithin me, unless you, O Olympian Muses, daughters of aegis-bearingJove, were to recount them to me. Nevertheless, I will tell thecaptains of the ships and all the fleet together.

ííííPeneleos, Leitus, Arcesilaus, Prothoenor, and Clonius werecaptains of the Boeotians. These were they that dwelt in Hyria androcky Aulis, and who held Schoenus, Scolus, and the highlands ofEteonus, with Thespeia, Graia, and the fair city of Mycalessus. Theyalso held Harma, Eilesium, and Erythrae; and they had Eleon, Hyle, andPeteon; Ocalea and the strong fortress of Medeon; Copae, Eutresis, andThisbe the haunt of doves; Coronea, and the pastures of Haliartus;Plataea and Glisas; the fortress of Thebes the less; holy Onchestuswith its famous grove of Neptune; Arne rich in vineyards; Midea,sacred Nisa, and Anthedon upon the sea. From these there came fiftyships, and in each there were a hundred and twenty young men of theBoeotians.

ííííAscalaphus and Ialmenus, sons of Mars, led the people that dweltin Aspledon and Orchomenus the realm of Minyas. Astyoche a noblemaiden bore them in the house of Actor son of Azeus; for she hadgone with Mars secretly into an upper chamber, and he had lain withher. With these there came thirty ships.

ííííThe Phoceans were led by Schedius and Epistrophus, sons of mightyIphitus the son of Naubolus. These were they that held Cyparissus,rocky Pytho, holy Crisa, Daulis, and Panopeus; they also that dwelt inAnemorea and Hyampolis, and about the waters of the river Cephissus,and Lilaea by the springs of the Cephissus; with their chieftains cameforty ships, and they marshalled the forces of the Phoceans, whichwere stationed next to the Boeotians, on their left.

ííííAjax, the fleet son of Oileus, commanded the Locrians. He was not sogreat, nor nearly so great, as Ajax the son of Telamon. He was alittle man, and his breastplate was made of linen, but in use of thespear he excelled all the Hellenes and the Achaeans. These dwelt inCynus, Opous, Calliarus, Bessa, Scarphe, fair Augeae, Tarphe, andThronium about the river Boagrius. With him there came forty shipsof the Locrians who dwell beyond Euboea.

ííííThe fierce Abantes held Euboea with its cities, Chalcis, Eretria,Histiaea rich in vines, Cerinthus upon the sea, and the rock-perchedtown of Dium; with them were also the men of Carystus and Styra;Elephenor of the race of Mars was in command of these; he was son ofChalcodon, and chief over all the Abantes. With him they came, fleetof foot and wearing their hair long behind, brave warriors, whowould ever strive to tear open the corslets of their foes with theirlong ashen spears. Of these there came fifty ships.

ííííAnd they that held the strong city of Athens, the people of greatErechtheus, who was born of the soil itself, but Jove's daughter,Minerva, fostered him, and established him at Athens in her own richsanctuary. There, year by year, the Athenian youths worship him withsacrifices of bulls and rams. These were commanded by Menestheus,son of Peteos. No man living could equal him in the marshalling ofchariots and foot soldiers. Nestor could alone rival him, for he wasolder. With him there came fifty ships.

ííííAjax brought twelve ships from Salamis, and stationed them alongsidethose of the Athenians.

ííííThe men of Argos, again, and those who held the walls of Tiryns,with Hermione, and Asine upon the gulf; Troezene, Eionae, and thevineyard lands of Epidaurus; the Achaean youths, moreover, who camefrom Aegina and Mases; these were led by Diomed of the loudbattle-cry, and Sthenelus son of famed Capaneus. With them incommand was Euryalus, son of king Mecisteus, son of Talaus; but Diomedwas chief over them all. With these there came eighty ships.

ííííThose who held the strong city of Mycenae, rich Corinth and Cleonae;Orneae, Araethyrea, and Licyon, where Adrastus reigned of old;Hyperesia, high Gonoessa, and Pellene; Aegium and all the coast-landround about Helice; these sent a hundred ships under the command ofKing Agamemnon, son of Atreus. His force was far both finest andmost numerous, and in their midst was the king himself, all gloriousin his armour of gleaming bronze- foremost among the heroes, for hewas the greatest king, and had most men under him.

ííííAnd those that dwelt in Lacedaemon, lying low among the hills,Pharis, Sparta, with Messe the haunt of doves; Bryseae, Augeae,Amyclae, and Helos upon the sea; Laas, moreover, and Oetylus; thesewere led by Menelaus of the loud battle-cry, brother to Agamemnon, andof them there were sixty ships, drawn up apart from the others.Among them went Menelaus himself, strong in zeal, urging his men tofight; for he longed to avenge the toil and sorrow that he hadsuffered for the sake of Helen.

ííííThe men of Pylos and Arene, and Thryum where is the ford of theriver Alpheus; strong Aipy, Cyparisseis, and Amphigenea; Pteleum,Helos, and Dorium, where the Muses met Thamyris, and stilled hisminstrelsy for ever. He was returning from Oechalia, where Eurytuslived and reigned, and boasted that he would surpass even the Muses,daughters of aegis-bearing Jove, if they should sing against him;whereon they were angry, and maimed him. They robbed him of his divinepower of song, and thenceforth he could strike the lyre no more. Thesewere commanded by Nestor, knight of Gerene, and with him there cameninety ships.

ííííAnd those that held Arcadia, under the high mountain of Cyllene,near the tomb of Aepytus, where the people fight hand to hand; the menof Pheneus also, and Orchomenus rich in flocks; of Rhipae, Stratie,and bleak Enispe; of Tegea and fair Mantinea; of Stymphelus andParrhasia; of these King Agapenor son of Ancaeus was commander, andthey had sixty ships. Many Arcadians, good soldiers, came in eachone of them, but Agamemnon found them the ships in which to crossthe sea, for they were not a people that occupied their businessupon the waters.

ííííThe men, moreover, of Buprasium and of Elis, so much of it as isenclosed between Hyrmine, Myrsinus upon the sea-shore, the rockOlene and Alesium. These had four leaders, and each of them had tenships, with many Epeans on board. Their captains were Amphimachusand Thalpius- the one, son of Cteatus, and the other, of Eurytus- bothof the race of Actor. The two others were Diores, son of Amarynces,and Polyxenus, son of King Agasthenes, son of Augeas.

ííííAnd those of Dulichium with the sacred Echinean islands, who dweltbeyond the sea off Elis; these were led by Meges, peer of Mars, andthe son of valiant Phyleus, dear to Jove, who quarrelled with hisfather, and went to settle in Dulichium. With him there came fortyships.

ííííUlysses led the brave Cephallenians, who held Ithaca, Neritum withits forests, Crocylea, rugged Aegilips, Samos and Zacynthus, withthe mainland also that was over against the islands. These were led byUlysses, peer of Jove in counsel, and with him there came twelveships.

ííííThoas, son of Andraemon, commanded the Aetolians, who dwelt inPleuron, Olenus, Pylene, Chalcis by the sea, and rocky Calydon, forthe great king Oeneus had now no sons living, and was himself dead, aswas also golden-haired Meleager, who had been set over the Aetoliansto be their king. And with Thoas there came forty ships.

ííííThe famous spearsman Idomeneus led the Cretans, who held Cnossus,and the well-walled city of Gortys; Lyctus also, Miletus andLycastus that lies upon the chalk; the populous towns of Phaestusand Rhytium, with the other peoples that dwelt in the hundred citiesof Crete. All these were led by Idomeneus, and by Meriones, peer ofmurderous Mars. And with these there came eighty ships.

ííííTlepolemus, son of Hercules, a man both brave and large ofstature, brought nine ships of lordly warriors from Rhodes. Thesedwelt in Rhodes which is divided among the three cities of Lindus,Ielysus, and Cameirus, that lies upon the chalk. These werecommanded by Tlepolemus, son of Hercules by Astyochea, whom he hadcarried off from Ephyra, on the river Selleis, after sacking manycities of valiant warriors. When Tlepolemus grew up, he killed hisfather's uncle Licymnius, who had been a famous warrior in his time,but was then grown old. On this he built himself a fleet, gathered agreat following, and fled beyond the sea, for he was menaced by theother sons and grandsons of Hercules. After a voyage. during whichhe suffered great hardship, he came to Rhodes, where the peopledivided into three communities, according to their tribes, and weredearly loved by Jove, the lord, of gods and men; wherefore the sonof Saturn showered down great riches upon them.

ííííAnd Nireus brought three ships from Syme- Nireus, who was thehandsomest man that came up under Ilius of all the Danaans after theson of Peleus- but he was a man of no substance, and had but a smallfollowing.

ííííAnd those that held Nisyrus, Crapathus, and Casus, with Cos, thecity of Eurypylus, and the Calydnian islands, these were commandedby Pheidippus and Antiphus, two sons of King Thessalus the son ofHercules. And with them there came thirty ships.

ííííThose again who held Pelasgic Argos, Alos, Alope, and Trachis; andthose of Phthia and Hellas the land of fair women, who were calledMyrmidons, Hellenes, and Achaeans; these had fifty ships, over whichAchilles was in command. But they now took no part in the war,inasmuch as there was no one to marshal them; for Achilles stayed byhis ships, furious about the loss of the girl Briseis, whom he hadtaken from Lyrnessus at his own great peril, when he had sackedLyrnessus and Thebe, and had overthrown Mynes and Epistrophus, sons ofking Evenor, son of Selepus. For her sake Achilles was still grieving,but ere long he was again to join them.

ííííAnd those that held Phylace and the flowery meadows of Pyrasus,sanctuary of Ceres; Iton, the mother of sheep; Antrum upon the sea,and Pteleum that lies upon the grass lands. Of these brave Protesilaushad been captain while he was yet alive, but he was now lying underthe earth. He had left a wife behind him in Phylace to tear her cheeksin sorrow, and his house was only half finished, for he was slain by aDardanian warrior while leaping foremost of the Achaeans upon the soilof Troy. Still, though his people mourned their chieftain, they werenot without a leader, for Podarces, of the race of Mars, marshalledthem; he was son of Iphiclus, rich in sheep, who was the son ofPhylacus, and he was own brother to Protesilaus, only younger,Protesilaus being at once the elder and the more valiant. So thepeople were not without a leader, though they mourned him whom theyhad lost. With him there came forty ships.

ííííAnd those that held Pherae by the Boebean lake, with Boebe,Glaphyrae, and the populous city of Iolcus, these with their elevenships were led by Eumelus, son of Admetus, whom Alcestis bore tohim, loveliest of the daughters of Pelias.

ííííAnd those that held Methone and Thaumacia, with Meliboea andrugged Olizon, these were led by the skilful archer Philoctetes, andthey had seven ships, each with fifty oarsmen all of them goodarchers; but Philoctetes was lying in great pain in the Island ofLemnos, where the sons of the Achaeans left him, for he had beenbitten by a poisonous water snake. There he lay sick and sorry, andfull soon did the Argives come to miss him. But his people, thoughthey felt his loss were not leaderless, for Medon, the bastard sonof Oileus by Rhene, set them in array.

ííííThose, again, of Tricca and the stony region of Ithome, and theythat held Oechalia, the city of Oechalian Eurytus, these werecommanded by the two sons of Aesculapius, skilled in the art ofhealing, Podalirius and Machaon. And with them there came thirtyships.

ííííThe men, moreover, of Ormenius, and by the fountain of Hypereia,with those that held Asterius, and the white crests of Titanus,these were led by Eurypylus, the son of Euaemon, and with them therecame forty ships.

ííííThose that held Argissa and Gyrtone, Orthe, Elone, and the whitecity of Oloosson, of these brave Polypoetes was leader. He was sonof Pirithous, who was son of Jove himself, for Hippodameia bore him toPirithous on the day when he took his revenge on the shaggy mountainsavages and drove them from Mt. Pelion to the Aithices. But Polypoeteswas not sole in command, for with him was Leonteus, of the race ofMars, who was son of Coronus, the son of Caeneus. And with these therecame forty ships.

ííííGuneus brought two and twenty ships from Cyphus, and he was followedby the Enienes and the valiant Peraebi, who dwelt about wintry Dodona,and held the lands round the lovely river Titaresius, which sendsits waters into the Peneus. They do not mingle with the silvereddies of the Peneus, but flow on the top of them like oil; for theTitaresius is a branch of dread Orcus and of the river Styx.

ííííOf the Magnetes, Prothous son of Tenthredon was commander. They werethey that dwelt about the river Peneus and Mt. Pelion. Prothous, fleetof foot, was their leader, and with him there came forty ships.

ííííSuch were the chiefs and princes of the Danaans. Who, then, OMuse, was the foremost, whether man or horse, among those thatfollowed after the sons of Atreus?

ííííOf the horses, those of the son of Pheres were by far the finest.They were driven by Eumelus, and were as fleet as birds. They wereof the same age and colour, and perfectly matched in height. Apollo,of the silver bow, had bred them in Perea- both of them mares, andterrible as Mars in battle. Of the men, Ajax, son of Telamon, was muchthe foremost so long as Achilles' anger lasted, for Achillesexcelled him greatly and he had also better horses; but Achilles wasnow holding aloof at his ships by reason of his quarrel withAgamemnon, and his people passed their time upon the sea shore,throwing discs or aiming with spears at a mark, and in archery.Their horses stood each by his own chariot, champing lotus and wildcelery. The chariots were housed under cover, but their owners, forlack of leadership, wandered hither and thither about the host andwent not forth to fight.

ííííThus marched the host like a consuming fire, and the earth groanedbeneath them when the lord of thunder is angry and lashes the landabout Typhoeus among the Arimi, where they say Typhoeus lies. Evenso did the earth groan beneath them as they sped over the plain.

ííííAnd now Iris, fleet as the wind, was sent by Jove to tell the badnews among the Trojans. They were gathered in assembly, old and young,at Priam's gates, and Iris came close up to Priam, speaking with thevoice of Priam's son Polites, who, being fleet of foot, wasstationed as watchman for the Trojans on the tomb of old Aesyetes,to look out for any sally of the Achaeans. In his likeness Iris spoke,saying, ""Old man, you talk idly, as in time of peace, while war isat hand. I have been in many a battle, but never yet saw such a hostas is now advancing. They are crossing the plain to attack the city asthick as leaves or as the sands of the sea. Hector, I charge you aboveall others, do as I say. There are many allies dispersed about thecity of Priam from distant places and speaking divers tongues.Therefore, let each chief give orders to his own people, settingthem severally in array and leading them forth to battle.""

ííííThus she spoke, but Hector knew that it was the goddess, and at oncebroke up the assembly. The men flew to arms; all the gates wereopened, and the people thronged through them, horse and foot, with thetramp as of a great multitude.

ííííNow there is a high mound before the city, rising by itself upon theplain. Men call it Batieia, but the gods know that it is the tomb oflithe Myrine. Here the Trojans and their allies divided their forces.

ííííPriam's son, great Hector of the gleaming helmet, commanded theTrojans, and with him were arrayed by far the greater number andmost valiant of those who were longing for the fray.

ííííThe Dardanians were led by brave Aeneas, whom Venus bore toAnchises, when she, goddess though she was, had lain with him upon themountain slopes of Ida. He was not alone, for with him were the twosons of Antenor, Archilochus and Acamas, both skilled in all thearts of war.

ííííThey that dwelt in Telea under the lowest spurs of Mt. Ida, men ofsubstance, who drink the limpid waters of the Aesepus, and are ofTrojan blood- these were led by Pandarus son of Lycaon, whom Apollohad taught to use the bow.

ííííThey that held Adresteia and the land of Apaesus, with Pityeia,and the high mountain of Tereia- these were led by Adrestus andAmphius, whose breastplate was of linen. These were the sons of Meropsof Percote, who excelled in all kinds of divination. He told themnot to take part in the war, but they gave him no heed, for fate luredthem to destruction.

ííííThey that dwelt about Percote and Practius, with Sestos, Abydos, andArisbe- these were led by Asius, son of Hyrtacus, a brave commander-Asius, the son of Hyrtacus, whom his powerful dark bay steeds, ofthe breed that comes from the river Selleis, had brought from Arisbe.

ííííHippothous led the tribes of Pelasgian spearsmen, who dwelt infertile Larissa- Hippothous, and Pylaeus of the race of Mars, two sonsof the Pelasgian Lethus, son of Teutamus.

ííííAcamas and the warrior Peirous commanded the Thracians and thosethat came from beyond the mighty stream of the Hellespont.

ííííEuphemus, son of Troezenus, the son of Ceos, was captain of theCiconian spearsmen.

ííííPyraechmes led the Paeonian archers from distant Amydon, by thebroad waters of the river Axius, the fairest that flow upon the earth.

ííííThe Paphlagonians were commanded by stout-hearted Pylaemanes fromEnetae, where the mules run wild in herds. These were they that heldCytorus and the country round Sesamus, with the cities by the riverParthenius, Cromna, Aegialus, and lofty Erithini.

ííííOdius and Epistrophus were captains over the Halizoni from distantAlybe, where there are mines of silver.

ííííChromis, and Ennomus the augur, led the Mysians, but his skill inaugury availed not to save him from destruction, for he fell by thehand of the fleet descendant of Aeacus in the river, where he slewothers also of the Trojans.

ííííPhorcys, again, and noble Ascanius led the Phrygians from the farcountry of Ascania, and both were eager for the fray.

ííííMesthles and Antiphus commanded the Meonians, sons of Talaemenes,born to him of the Gygaean lake. These led the Meonians, who dweltunder Mt. Tmolus.

ííííNastes led the Carians, men of a strange speech. These heldMiletus and the wooded mountain of Phthires, with the water of theriver Maeander and the lofty crests of Mt. Mycale. These werecommanded by Nastes and Amphimachus, the brave sons of Nomion. He cameinto the fight with gold about him, like a girl; fool that he was, hisgold was of no avail to save him, for he fell in the river by the handof the fleet descendant of Aeacus, and Achilles bore away his gold.

ííííSarpedon and Glaucus led the Lycians from their distant land, by theeddying waters of the Xanthus.

ííííBOOK III

ííííWhen the companies were thus arrayed, each under its own captain,the Trojans advanced as a flight of wild fowl or cranes that screamoverhead when rain and winter drive them over the flowing waters ofOceanus to bring death and destruction on the Pygmies, and theywrangle in the air as they fly; but the Achaeans marched silently,in high heart, and minded to stand by one another.

ííííAs when the south wind spreads a curtain of mist upon the mountaintops, bad for shepherds but better than night for thieves, and a mancan see no further than he can throw a stone, even so rose the dustfrom under their feet as they made all speed over the plain.

ííííWhen they were close up with one another, Alexandrus came forward aschampion on the Trojan side. On his shoulders he bore the skin of apanther, his bow, and his sword, and he brandished two spears shodwith bronze as a challenge to the bravest of the Achaeans to meethim in single fight. Menelaus saw him thus stride out before theranks, and was glad as a hungry lion that lights on the carcase ofsome goat or horned stag, and devours it there and then, though dogsand youths set upon him. Even thus was Menelaus glad when his eyescaught sight of Alexandrus, for he deemed that now he should berevenged. He sprang, therefore, from his chariot, clad in his suitof armour.

ííííAlexandrus quailed as he saw Menelaus come forward, and shrank infear of his life under cover of his men. As one who starts backaffrighted, trembling and pale, when he comes suddenly upon aserpent in some mountain glade, even so did Alexandrus plunge into thethrong of Trojan warriors, terror-stricken at the sight of the sonAtreus.

ííííThen Hector upbraided him. ""Paris,"" said he, ""evil-hearted Paris,fair to see, but woman-mad, and false of tongue, would that you hadnever been born, or that you had died unwed. Better so, than live tobe disgraced and looked askance at. Will not the Achaeans mock at usand say that we have sent one to champion us who is fair to see butwho has neither wit nor courage? Did you not, such as you are, getyour following together and sail beyond the seas? Did you not fromyour a far country carry off a lovely woman wedded among a people ofwarriors- to bring sorrow upon your father, your city, and yourwhole country, but joy to your enemies, and hang-dog shamefacedness toyourself? And now can you not dare face Menelaus and learn what mannerof man he is whose wife you have stolen? Where indeed would be yourlyre and your love-tricks, your comely locks and your fair favour,when you were lying in the dust before him? The Trojans are aweak-kneed people, or ere this you would have had a shirt of stonesfor the wrongs you have done them.""

ííííAnd Alexandrus answered, ""Hector, your rebuke is just. You arehard as the axe which a shipwright wields at his work, and cleaves thetimber to his liking. As the axe in his hand, so keen is the edge ofyour scorn. Still, taunt me not with the gifts that golden Venus hasgiven me; they are precious; let not a man disdain them, for thegods give them where they are minded, and none can have them for theasking. If you would have me do battle with Menelaus, bid theTrojans and Achaeans take their seats, while he and I fight in theirmidst for Helen and all her wealth. Let him who shall be victoriousand prove to be the better man take the woman and all she has, to bearthem to his home, but let the rest swear to a solemn covenant of peacewhereby you Trojans shall stay here in Troy, while the others gohome to Argos and the land of the Achaeans.""

ííííWhen Hector heard this he was glad, and went about among theTrojan ranks holding his spear by the middle to keep them back, andthey all sat down at his bidding: but the Achaeans still aimed athim with stones and arrows, till Agamemnon shouted to them saying,""Hold, Argives, shoot not, sons of the Achaeans; Hector desires tospeak.""

ííííThey ceased taking aim and were still, whereon Hector spoke. ""Hearfrom my mouth,"" said he, ""Trojans and Achaeans, the saying ofAlexandrus, through whom this quarrel has come about. He bids theTrojans and Achaeans lay their armour upon the ground, while he andMenelaus fight in the midst of you for Helen and all her wealth. Lethim who shall be victorious and prove to be the better man take thewoman and all she has, to bear them to his own home, but let therest swear to a solemn covenant of peace.""

ííííThus he spoke, and they all held their peace, till Menelaus of theloud battle-cry addressed them. ""And now,"" he said, ""hear me too,for it is I who am the most aggrieved. I deem that the parting ofAchaeans and Trojans is at hand, as well it may be, seeing how muchhave suffered for my quarrel with Alexandrus and the wrong he didme. Let him who shall die, die, and let the others fight no more.Bring, then, two lambs, a white ram and a black ewe, for Earth andSun, and we will bring a third for Jove. Moreover, you shall bid Priamcome, that he may swear to the covenant himself; for his sons arehigh-handed and ill to trust, and the oaths of Jove must not betransgressed or taken in vain. Young men's minds are light as air, butwhen an old man comes he looks before and after, deeming that whichshall be fairest upon both sides.""

ííííThe Trojans and Achaeans were glad when they heard this, for theythought that they should now have rest. They backed their chariotstoward the ranks, got out of them, and put off their armour, laying itdown upon the ground; and the hosts were near to one another with alittle space between them. Hector sent two messengers to the city tobring the lambs and to bid Priam come, while Agamemnon told Talthybiusto fetch the other lamb from the ships, and he did as Agamemnon hadsaid.

ííííMeanwhile Iris went to Helen in the form of her sister-in-law,wife of the son of Antenor, for Helicaon, son of Antenor, hadmarried Laodice, the fairest of Priam's daughters. She found her inher own room, working at a great web of purple linen, on which she wasembroidering the battles between Trojans and Achaeans, that Mars hadmade them fight for her sake. Iris then came close up to her and said,""Come hither, child, and see the strange doings of the Trojans andAchaeans till now they have been warring upon the plain, mad with lustof battle, but now they have left off fighting, and are leaning upontheir shields, sitting still with their spears planted beside them.Alexandrus and Menelaus are going to fight about yourself, and you areto the the wife of him who is the victor.""

ííííThus spoke the goddess, and Helen's heart yearned after her formerhusband, her city, and her parents. She threw a white mantle overher head, and hurried from her room, weeping as she went, not alone,but attended by two of her handmaids, Aethrae, daughter of Pittheus,and Clymene. And straightway they were at the Scaean gates.

ííííThe two sages, Ucalegon and Antenor, elders of the people, wereseated by the Scaean gates, with Priam, Panthous, Thymoetes, Lampus,Clytius, and Hiketaon of the race of Mars. These were too old tofight, but they were fluent orators, and sat on the tower like cicalesthat chirrup delicately from the boughs of some high tree in a wood.When they saw Helen coming towards the tower, they said softly toone another, ""Small wonder that Trojans and Achaeans should endureso much and so long, for the sake of a woman so marvellously anddivinely lovely. Still, fair though she be, let them take her andgo, or she will breed sorrow for us and for our children after us.""

ííííBut Priam bade her draw nigh. ""My child,"" said he, ""take your seatin front of me that you may see your former husband, your kinsmenand your friends. I lay no blame upon you, it is the gods, not you whoare to blame. It is they that have brought about this terrible warwith the Achaeans. Tell me, then, who is yonder huge hero so great andgoodly? I have seen men taller by a head, but none so comely and soroyal. Surely he must be a king.""

íííí""Sir,"" answered Helen, ""father of my husband, dear and reverend inmy eyes, would that I had chosen death rather than to have come herewith your son, far from my bridal chamber, my friends, my darlingdaughter, and all the companions of my girlhood. But it was not to be,and my lot is one of tears and sorrow. As for your question, thehero of whom you ask is Agamemnon, son of Atreus, a good king and abrave soldier, brother-in-law as surely as that he lives, to myabhorred and miserable self.""

ííííThe old man marvelled at him and said, ""Happy son of Atreus, childof good fortune. I see that the Achaeans are subject to you in greatmultitudes. When I was in Phrygia I saw much horsemen, the people ofOtreus and of Mygdon, who were camping upon the banks of the riverSangarius; I was their ally, and with them when the Amazons, peersof men, came up against them, but even they were not so many as theAchaeans.""

ííííThe old man next looked upon Ulysses; ""Tell me,"" he said, ""who isthat other, shorter by a head than Agamemnon, but broader across thechest and shoulders? His armour is laid upon the ground, and he stalksin front of the ranks as it were some great woolly ram ordering hisewes.""

ííííAnd Helen answered, ""He is Ulysses, a man of great craft, son ofLaertes. He was born in rugged Ithaca, and excels in all manner ofstratagems and subtle cunning.""

ííííOn this Antenor said, ""Madam, you have spoken truly. Ulysses oncecame here as envoy about yourself, and Menelaus with him. I receivedthem in my own house, and therefore know both of them by sight andconversation. When they stood up in presence of the assembled Trojans,Menelaus was the broader shouldered, but when both were seated Ulysseshad the more royal presence. After a time they delivered theirmessage, and the speech of Menelaus ran trippingly on the tongue; hedid not say much, for he was a man of few words, but he spoke veryclearly and to the point, though he was the younger man of the two;Ulysses, on the other hand, when he rose to speak, was at first silentand kept his eyes fixed upon the ground. There was no play norgraceful movement of his sceptre; he kept it straight and stiff like aman unpractised in oratory- one might have taken him for a merechurl or simpleton; but when he raised his voice, and the words camedriving from his deep chest like winter snow before the wind, thenthere was none to touch him, and no man thought further of what helooked like.""

ííííPriam then caught sight of Ajax and asked, ""Who is that great andgoodly warrior whose head and broad shoulders tower above the restof the Argives?""

íííí""That,"" answered Helen, ""is huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans,and on the other side of him, among the Cretans, stands Idomeneuslooking like a god, and with the captains of the Cretans round him.Often did Menelaus receive him as a guest in our house when he camevisiting us from Crete. I see, moreover, many other Achaeans whosenames I could tell you, but there are two whom I can nowhere find,Castor, breaker of horses, and Pollux the mighty boxer; they arechildren of my mother, and own brothers to myself. Either they havenot left Lacedaemon, or else, though they have brought their ships,they will not show themselves in battle for the shame and disgracethat I have brought upon them.""

ííííShe knew not that both these heroes were already lying under theearth in their own land of Lacedaemon.

ííííMeanwhile the heralds were bringing the holy oath-offeringsthrough the city- two lambs and a goatskin of wine, the gift of earth;and Idaeus brought the mixing bowl and the cups of gold. He went up toPriam and said, ""Son of Laomedon, the princes of the Trojans andAchaeans bid you come down on to the plain and swear to a solemncovenant. Alexandrus and Menelaus are to fight for Helen in singlecombat, that she and all her wealth may go with him who is the victor.We are to swear to a solemn covenant of peace whereby we othersshall dwell here in Troy, while the Achaeans return to Argos and theland of the Achaeans.""

ííííThe old man trembled as he heard, but bade his followers yoke thehorses, and they made all haste to do so. He mounted the chariot,gathered the reins in his hand, and Antenor took his seat besidehim; they then drove through the Scaean gates on to the plain. Whenthey reached the ranks of the Trojans and Achaeans they left thechariot, and with measured pace advanced into the space between thehosts.

ííííAgamemnon and Ulysses both rose to meet them. The attendants broughton the oath-offerings and mixed the wine in the mixing-bowls; theypoured water over the hands of the chieftains, and the son of Atreusdrew the dagger that hung by his sword, and cut wool from the lambs'heads; this the men-servants gave about among the Trojan and Achaeanprinces, and the son of Atreus lifted up his hands in prayer.""Father Jove,"" he cried, ""that rulest in Ida, most glorious inpower, and thou oh Sun, that seest and givest ear to all things, Earthand Rivers, and ye who in the realms below chastise the soul of himthat has broken his oath, witness these rites and guard them, thatthey be not vain. If Alexandrus kills Menelaus, let him keep Helen andall her wealth, while we sail home with our ships; but if Menelauskills Alexandrus, let the Trojans give back Helen and all that shehas; let them moreover pay such fine to the Achaeans as shall beagreed upon, in testimony among those that shall be born hereafter.Aid if Priam and his sons refuse such fine when Alexandrus has fallen,then will I stay here and fight on till I have got satisfaction.""

ííííAs he spoke he drew his knife across the throats of the victims, andlaid them down gasping and dying upon the ground, for the knife hadreft them of their strength. Then they poured wine from themixing-bowl into the cups, and prayed to the everlasting gods, saying,Trojans and Achaeans among one another, ""Jove, most great andglorious, and ye other everlasting gods, grant that the brains of themwho shall first sin against their oaths- of them and their children-may be shed upon the ground even as this wine, and let their wivesbecome the slaves of strangers.""

ííííThus they prayed, but not as yet would Jove grant them their prayer.Then Priam, descendant of Dardanus, spoke, saying, ""Hear me, Trojansand Achaeans, I will now go back to the wind-beaten city of Ilius: Idare not with my own eyes witness this fight between my son andMenelaus, for Jove and the other immortals alone know which shallfall.""

ííííOn this he laid the two lambs on his chariot and took his seat. Hegathered the reins in his hand, and Antenor sat beside him; the twothen went back to Ilius. Hector and Ulysses measured the ground, andcast lots from a helmet of bronze to see which should take aimfirst. Meanwhile the two hosts lifted up their hands and prayedsaying, ""Father Jove, that rulest from Ida, most glorious in power,grant that he who first brought about this war between us may die, andenter the house of Hades, while we others remain at peace and abide byour oaths.""

ííííGreat Hector now turned his head aside while he shook the helmet,and the lot of Paris flew out first. The others took their severalstations, each by his horses and the place where his arms werelying, while Alexandrus, husband of lovely Helen, put on his goodlyarmour. First he greaved his legs with greaves of good make and fittedwith ancle-clasps of silver; after this he donned the cuirass of hisbrother Lycaon, and fitted it to his own body; he hung hissilver-studded sword of bronze about his shoulders, and then hismighty shield. On his comely head he set his helmet, well-wrought,with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it, and hegrasped a redoubtable spear that suited his hands. In like fashionMenelaus also put on his armour.

ííííWhen they had thus armed, each amid his own people, they strodefierce of aspect into the open space, and both Trojans and Achaeanswere struck with awe as they beheld them. They stood near oneanother on the measured ground, brandishing their spears, and eachfurious against the other. Alexandrus aimed first, and struck theround shield of the son of Atreus, but the spear did not pierce it,for the shield turned its point. Menelaus next took aim, praying toFather Jove as he did so. ""King Jove,"" he said, ""grant me revenge onAlexandrus who has wronged me; subdue him under my hand that in agesyet to come a man may shrink from doing ill deeds in the house ofhis host.""

ííííHe poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it at the shield ofAlexandrus. Through shield and cuirass it went, and tore the shirtby his flank, but Alexandrus swerved aside, and thus saved his life.Then the son of Atreus drew his sword, and drove at the projectingpart of his helmet, but the sword fell shivered in three or fourpieces from his hand, and he cried, looking towards Heaven, ""FatherJove, of all gods thou art the most despiteful; I made sure of myrevenge, but the sword has broken in my hand, my spear has been hurledin vain, and I have not killed him.""

ííííWith this he flew at Alexandrus, caught him by the horsehair plumeof his helmet, and began dragging him towards the Achaeans. Thestrap of the helmet that went under his chin was choking him, andMenelaus would have dragged him off to his own great glory had notJove's daughter Venus been quick to mark and to break the strap ofoxhide, so that the empty helmet came away in his hand. This heflung to his comrades among the Achaeans, and was again springing uponAlexandrus to run him through with a spear, but Venus snatched himup in a moment (as a god can do), hid him under a cloud of darkness,and conveyed him to his own bedchamber.

ííííThen she went to call Helen, and found her on a high tower withthe Trojan women crowding round her. She took the form of an old womanwho used to dress wool for her when she was still in Lacedaemon, andof whom she was very fond. Thus disguised she plucked her byperfumed robe and said, ""Come hither; Alexandrus says you are to go tothe house; he is on his bed in his own room, radiant with beauty anddressed in gorgeous apparel. No one would think he had just comefrom fighting, but rather that he was going to a dance, or had donedancing and was sitting down.""

ííííWith these words she moved the heart of Helen to anger. When shemarked the beautiful neck of the goddess, her lovely bosom, andsparkling eyes, she marvelled at her and said, ""Goddess, why do youthus beguile me? Are you going to send me afield still further to someman whom you have taken up in Phrygia or fair Meonia? Menelaus hasjust vanquished Alexandrus, and is to take my hateful self back withhim. You are come here to betray me. Go sit with Alexandrusyourself; henceforth be goddess no longer; never let your feet carryyou back to Olympus; worry about him and look after him till he makeyou his wife, or, for the matter of that, his slave- but me? I shallnot go; I can garnish his bed no longer; I should be a by-word amongall the women of Troy. Besides, I have trouble on my mind.""

ííííVenus was very angry, and said, ""Bold hussy, do not provoke me; ifyou do, I shall leave you to your fate and hate you as much as Ihave loved you. I will stir up fierce hatred between Trojans andAchaeans, and you shall come to a bad end.""

ííííAt this Helen was frightened. She wrapped her mantle about her andwent in silence, following the goddess and unnoticed by the Trojanwomen.

ííííWhen they came to the house of Alexandrus the maid-servants setabout their work, but Helen went into her own room, and thelaughter-loving goddess took a seat and set it for her facingAlexandrus. On this Helen, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, sat down,and with eyes askance began to upbraid her husband.

íííí""So you are come from the fight,"" said she; ""would that you hadfallen rather by the hand of that brave man who was my husband. Youused to brag that you were a better man with hands and spear thanMenelaus. go, but I then, an challenge him again- but I shouldadvise you not to do so, for if you are foolish enough to meet himin single combat, you will soon all by his spear.""

ííííAnd Paris answered, ""Wife, do not vex me with your reproaches.This time, with the help of Minerva, Menelaus has vanquished me;another time I may myself be victor, for I too have gods that willstand by me. Come, let us lie down together and make friends. Neveryet was I so passionately enamoured of you as at this moment- not evenwhen I first carried you off from Lacedaemon and sailed away with you-not even when I had converse with you upon the couch of love in theisland of Cranae was I so enthralled by desire of you as now."" On thishe led her towards the bed, and his wife went with him.

ííííThus they laid themselves on the bed together; but the son of Atreusstrode among the throng, looking everywhere for Alexandrus, and noman, neither of the Trojans nor of the allies, could find him. If theyhad seen him they were in no mind to hide him, for they all of themhated him as they did death itself. Then Agamemnon, king of men,spoke, saying, ""Hear me, Trojans, Dardanians, and allies. Thevictory has been with Menelaus; therefore give back Helen with all herwealth, and pay such fine as shall be agreed upon, in testimonyamong them that shall be born hereafter.""

ííííThus spoke the son of Atreus, and the Achaeans shouted in applause.

ííííBOOK IV

ííííNow the gods were sitting with Jove in council upon the golden floorwhile Hebe went round pouring out nectar for them to drink, and asthey pledged one another in their cups of gold they looked down uponthe town of Troy. The son of Saturn then began to tease Juno,talking at her so as to provoke her. ""Menelaus,"" said he, ""has twogood friends among the goddesses, Juno of Argos, and Minerva ofAlalcomene, but they only sit still and look on, while Venus keepsever by Alexandrus' side to defend him in any danger; indeed she hasjust rescued him when he made sure that it was all over with him-for the victory really did lie with Menelaus. We must consider what weshall do about all this; shall we set them fighting anew or make peacebetween them? If you will agree to this last Menelaus can take backHelen and the city of Priam may remain still inhabited.""

ííííMinerva and Juno muttered their discontent as they sat side byside hatching mischief for the Trojans. Minerva scowled at her father,for she was in a furious passion with him, and said nothing, butJuno could not contain herself. ""Dread son of Saturn,"" said she,""what, pray, is the meaning of all this? Is my trouble, then, to gofor nothing, and the sweat that I have sweated, to say nothing of myhorses, while getting the people together against Priam and hischildren? Do as you will, but we other gods shall not all of usapprove your counsel.""

ííííJove was angry and answered, ""My dear, what harm have Priam andhis sons done you that you are so hotly bent on sacking the city ofIlius? Will nothing do for you but you must within their walls and eatPriam raw, with his sons and all the other Trojans to boot? Have ityour own way then; for I would not have this matter become a bone ofcontention between us. I say further, and lay my saying to your heart,if ever I want to sack a city belonging to friends of yours, youmust not try to stop me; you will have to let me do it, for I amgiving in to you sorely against my will. Of all inhabited cities underthe sun and stars of heaven, there was none that I so much respectedas Ilius with Priam and his whole people. Equitable feasts werenever wanting about my altar, nor the savour of burning fat, whichis honour due to ourselves.""

íííí""My own three favourite cities,"" answered Juno, ""are Argos,Sparta, and Mycenae. Sack them whenever you may be displeased withthem. I shall not defend them and I shall not care. Even if I did, andtried to stay you, I should take nothing by it, for you are muchstronger than I am, but I will not have my own work wasted. I too am agod and of the same race with yourself. I am Saturn's eldest daughter,and am honourable not on this ground only, but also because I amyour wife, and you are king over the gods. Let it be a case, then,of give-and-take between us, and the rest of the gods will followour lead. Tell Minerva to go and take part in the fight at once, andlet her contrive that the Trojans shall be the first to break theiroaths and set upon the Achaeans.""

ííííThe sire of gods and men heeded her words, and said to Minerva,""Go at once into the Trojan and Achaean hosts, and contrive that theTrojans shall be the first to break their oaths and set upon theAchaeans.""

ííííThis was what Minerva was already eager to do, so down she dartedfrom the topmost summits of Olympus. She shot through the sky assome brilliant meteor which the son of scheming Saturn has sent as asign to mariners or to some great army, and a fiery train of lightfollows in its wake. The Trojans and Achaeans were struck with aweas they beheld, and one would turn to his neighbour, saying, ""Eitherwe shall again have war and din of combat, or Jove the lord ofbattle will now make peace between us.""

ííííThus did they converse. Then Minerva took the form of Laodocus,son of Antenor, and went through the ranks of the Trojans to findPandarus, the redoubtable son of Lycaon. She found him standingamong the stalwart heroes who had followed him from the banks of theAesopus, so she went close up to him and said, ""Brave son of Lycaon,will you do as I tell you? If you dare send an arrow at Menelaus youwill win honour and thanks from all the Trojans, and especially fromprince Alexandrus- he would be the first to requite you veryhandsomely if he could see Menelaus mount his funeral pyre, slain byan arrow from your hand. Take your home aim then, and pray to LycianApollo, the famous archer; vow that when you get home to your strongcity of Zelea you will offer a hecatomb of firstling lambs in hishonour.""

ííííHis fool's heart was persuaded, and he took his bow from its case.This bow was made from the horns of a wild ibex which he had killed asit was bounding from a rock; he had stalked it, and it had fallen asthe arrow struck it to the heart. Its horns were sixteen palms long,and a worker in horn had made them into a bow, smoothing them welldown, and giving them tips of gold. When Pandarus had strung his bowhe laid it carefully on the ground, and his brave followers held theirshields before him lest the Achaeans should set upon him before he hadshot Menelaus. Then he opened the lid of his quiver and took out awinged arrow that had yet been shot, fraught with the pangs ofdeath. He laid the arrow on the string and prayed to Lycian Apollo,the famous archer, vowing that when he got home to his strong cityof Zelea he would offer a hecatomb of firstling lambs in his honour.He laid the notch of the arrow on the oxhide bowstring, and drewboth notch and string to his breast till the arrow-head was near thebow; then when the bow was arched into a half-circle he let fly, andthe bow twanged, and the string sang as the arrow flew gladly onover the heads of the throng.

ííííBut the blessed gods did not forget thee, O Menelaus, and Jove'sdaughter, driver of the spoil, was the first to stand before theeand ward off the piercing arrow. She turned it from his skin as amother whisks a fly from off her child when it is sleeping sweetly;she guided it to the part where the golden buckles of the belt thatpassed over his double cuirass were fastened, so the arrow struckthe belt that went tightly round him. It went right through this andthrough the cuirass of cunning workmanship; it also pierced the beltbeneath it, which he wore next his skin to keep out darts or arrows;it was this that served him in the best stead, nevertheless thearrow went through it and grazed the top of the skin, so that bloodbegan flowing from the wound.

ííííAs when some woman of Meonia or Caria strains purple dye on to apiece of ivory that is to be the cheek-piece of a horse, and is tobe laid up in a treasure house- many a knight is fain to bear it,but the king keeps it as an ornament of which both horse and drivermay be proud- even so, O Menelaus, were your shapely thighs and yourlegs down to your fair ancles stained with blood.

ííííWhen King Agamemnon saw the blood flowing from the wound he wasafraid, and so was brave Menelaus himself till he saw that the barbsof the arrow and the thread that bound the arrow-head to the shaftwere still outside the wound. Then he took heart, but Agamemnon heaveda deep sigh as he held Menelaus's hand in his own, and his comradesmade moan in concert. ""Dear brother, ""he cried, ""I have been the deathof you in pledging this covenant and letting you come forward as ourchampion. The Trojans have trampled on their oaths and have woundedyou; nevertheless the oath, the blood of lambs, the drink-offeringsand the right hands of fellowship in which have put our trust shallnot be vain. If he that rules Olympus fulfil it not here and now,he. will yet fulfil it hereafter, and they shall pay dearly with theirlives and with their wives and children. The day will surely come whenmighty Ilius shall be laid low, with Priam and Priam's people, whenthe son of Saturn from his high throne shall overshadow them withhis awful aegis in punishment of their present treachery. This shallsurely be; but how, Menelaus, shall I mourn you, if it be your lot nowto die? I should return to Argos as a by-word, for the Achaeans willat once go home. We shall leave Priam and the Trojans the glory ofstill keeping Helen, and the earth will rot your bones as you lie hereat Troy with your purpose not fulfilled. Then shall some braggartTrojan leap upon your tomb and say, 'Ever thus may Agamemnon wreak hisvengeance; he brought his army in vain; he is gone home to his ownland with empty ships, and has left Menelaus behind him.' Thus willone of them say, and may the earth then swallow me.""

ííííBut Menelaus reassured him and said, ""Take heart, and do not alarmthe people; the arrow has not struck me in a mortal part, for my outerbelt of burnished metal first stayed it, and under this my cuirass andthe belt of mail which the bronze-smiths made me.""

ííííAnd Agamemnon answered, ""I trust, dear Menelaus, that it may be evenso, but the surgeon shall examine your wound and lay herbs upon itto relieve your pain.""

ííííHe then said to Talthybius, ""Talthybius, tell Machaon, son to thegreat physician, Aesculapius, to come and see Menelaus immediately.Some Trojan or Lycian archer has wounded him with an arrow to ourdismay, and to his own great glory.""

ííííTalthybius did as he was told, and went about the host trying tofind Machaon. Presently he found standing amid the brave warriorswho had followed him from Tricca; thereon he went up to him andsaid, ""Son of Aesculapius, King Agamemnon says you are to come and seeMenelaus immediately. Some Trojan or Lycian archer has wounded himwith an arrow to our dismay and to his own great glory.""

ííííThus did he speak, and Machaon was moved to go. They passedthrough the spreading host of the Achaeans and went on till theycame to the place where Menelaus had been wounded and was lying withthe chieftains gathered in a circle round him. Machaon passed into themiddle of the ring and at once drew the arrow from the belt, bendingits barbs back through the force with which he pulled it out. He undidthe burnished belt, and beneath this the cuirass and the belt ofmail which the bronze-smiths had made; then, when he had seen thewound, he wiped away the blood and applied some soothing drugs whichChiron had given to Aesculapius out of the good will he bore him.

ííííWhile they were thus busy about Menelaus, the Trojans came forwardagainst them, for they had put on their armour, and now renewed thefight.

ííííYou would not have then found Agamemnon asleep nor cowardly andunwilling to fight, but eager rather for the fray. He left his chariotrich with bronze and his panting steeds in charge of Eurymedon, son ofPtolemaeus the son of Peiraeus, and bade him hold them in readinessagainst the time his limbs should weary of going about and givingorders to so many, for he went among the ranks on foot. When he sawmen hasting to the front he stood by them and cheered them on.""Argives,"" said he, ""slacken not one whit in your onset; father Jovewill be no helper of liars; the Trojans have been the first to breaktheir oaths and to attack us; therefore they shall be devoured ofvultures; we shall take their city and carry off their wives andchildren in our ships.""

ííííBut he angrily rebuked those whom he saw shirking and disinclined tofight. ""Argives,"" he cried, ""cowardly miserable creatures, have you noshame to stand here like frightened fawns who, when they can no longerscud over the plain, huddle together, but show no fight? You are asdazed and spiritless as deer. Would you wait till the Trojans reachthe sterns of our ships as they lie on the shore, to see, whetherthe son of Saturn will hold his hand over you to protect you?""

ííííThus did he go about giving his orders among the ranks. Passingthrough the crowd, he came presently on the Cretans, arming roundIdomeneus, who was at their head, fierce as a wild boar, whileMeriones was bringing up the battalions that were in the rear.Agamemnon was glad when he saw him, and spoke him fairly. ""Idomeneus,""said he, ""I treat you with greater distinction than I do any others ofthe Achaeans, whether in war or in other things, or at table. When theprinces are mixing my choicest wines in the mixing-bowls, they haveeach of them a fixed allowance, but your cup is kept always fulllike my own, that you may drink whenever you are minded. Go,therefore, into battle, and show yourself the man you have been alwaysproud to be.""

ííííIdomeneus answered, ""I will be a trusty comrade, as I promised youfrom the first I would be. Urge on the other Achaeans, that we mayjoin battle at once, for the Trojans have trampled upon theircovenants. Death and destruction shall be theirs, seeing they havebeen the first to break their oaths and to attack us.""

ííííThe son of Atreus went on, glad at heart, till he came upon thetwo Ajaxes arming themselves amid a host of foot-soldiers. As when agoat-herd from some high post watches a storm drive over the deepbefore the west wind- black as pitch is the offing and a mightywhirlwind draws towards him, so that he is afraid and drives his flockinto a cave- even thus did the ranks of stalwart youths move in a darkmass to battle under the Ajaxes, horrid with shield and spear. Gladwas King Agamemnon when he saw them. ""No need,"" he cried, ""to giveorders to such leaders of the Argives as you are, for of your ownselves you spur your men on to fight with might and main. Would, byfather Jove, Minerva, and Apollo that all were so minded as you are,for the city of Priam would then soon fall beneath our hands, and weshould sack it.""

ííííWith this he left them and went onward to Nestor, the facile speakerof the Pylians, who was marshalling his men and urging them on, incompany with Pelagon, Alastor, Chromius, Haemon, and Bias shepherdof his people. He placed his knights with their chariots and horses inthe front rank, while the foot-soldiers, brave men and many, whom hecould trust, were in the rear. The cowards he drove into the middle,that they might fight whether they would or no. He gave his ordersto the knights first, bidding them hold their horses well in hand,so as to avoid confusion. ""Let no man,"" he said, ""relying on hisstrength or horsemanship, get before the others and engage singly withthe Trojans, nor yet let him lag behind or you will weaken yourattack; but let each when he meets an enemy's chariot throw hisspear from his own; this be much the best; this is how the men ofold took towns and strongholds; in this wise were they minded.""

ííííThus did the old man charge them, for he had been in many a fight,and King Agamemnon was glad. ""I wish,"" he said to him, that your limbswere as supple and your strength as sure as your judgment is; but age,the common enemy of mankind, has laid his hand upon you; would that ithad fallen upon some other, and that you were still young.""

ííííAnd Nestor, knight of Gerene, answered, ""Son of Atreus, I toowould gladly be the man I was when I slew mighty Ereuthalion; butthe gods will not give us everything at one and the same time. I wasthen young, and now I am old; still I can go with my knights andgive them that counsel which old men have a right to give. Thewielding of the spear I leave to those who are younger and strongerthan myself.""

ííííAgamemnon went his way rejoicing, and presently found Menestheus,son of Peteos, tarrying in his place, and with him were theAthenians loud of tongue in battle. Near him also tarried cunningUlysses, with his sturdy Cephallenians round him; they had not yetheard the battle-cry, for the ranks of Trojans and Achaeans had onlyjust begun to move, so they were standing still, waiting for someother columns of the Achaeans to attack the Trojans and begin thefighting. When he saw this Agamemnon rebuked them and said, ""Son ofPeteos, and you other, steeped in cunning, heart of guile, why standyou here cowering and waiting on others? You two should be of allmen foremost when there is hard fighting to be done, for you areever foremost to accept my invitation when we councillors of theAchaeans are holding feast. You are glad enough then to take your fillof roast meats and to drink wine as long as you please, whereas nowyou would not care though you saw ten columns of Achaeans engage theenemy in front of you.""

ííííUlysses glared at him and answered, ""Son of Atreus, what are youtalking about? How can you say that we are slack? When the Achaeansare in full fight with the Trojans, you shall see, if you care to doso, that the father of Telemachus will join battle with the foremostof them. You are talking idly.""

ííííWhen Agamemnon saw that Ulysses was angry, he smiled pleasantly athim and withdrew his words. ""Ulysses,"" said he, ""noble son of Laertes,excellent in all good counsel, I have neither fault to find nor ordersto give you, for I know your heart is right, and that you and I are ofa mind. Enough; I will make you amends for what I have said, and ifany ill has now been spoken may the gods bring it to nothing.""

ííííHe then left them and went on to others. Presently he saw the son ofTydeus, noble Diomed, standing by his chariot and horses, withSthenelus the son of Capaneus beside him; whereon he began toupbraid him. ""Son of Tydeus,"" he said, ""why stand you cowering hereupon the brink of battle? Tydeus did not shrink thus, but was everahead of his men when leading them on against the foe- so, at least,say they that saw him in battle, for I never set eyes upon him myself.They say that there was no man like him. He came once to Mycenae,not as an enemy but as a guest, in company with Polynices to recruithis forces, for they were levying war against the strong city ofThebes, and prayed our people for a body of picked men to help them.The men of Mycenae were willing to let them have one, but Jovedissuaded them by showing them unfavourable omens. Tydeus,therefore, and Polynices went their way. When they had got as farthe deep-meadowed and rush-grown banks of the Aesopus, the Achaeanssent Tydeus as their envoy, and he found the Cadmeans gathered ingreat numbers to a banquet in the house of Eteocles. Stranger thoughhe was, he knew no fear on finding himself single-handed among somany, but challenged them to contests of all kinds, and in each one ofthem was at once victorious, so mightily did Minerva help him. TheCadmeans were incensed at his success, and set a force of fifty youthswith two captains- the godlike hero Maeon, son of Haemon, andPolyphontes, son of Autophonus- at their head, to lie in wait forhim on his return journey; but Tydeus slew every man of them, saveonly Maeon, whom he let go in obedience to heaven's omens. Such wasTydeus of Aetolia. His son can talk more glibly, but he cannot fightas his father did.""

ííííDiomed made no answer, for he was shamed by the rebuke of Agamemnon;but the son of Capaneus took up his words and said, ""Son of Atreus,tell no lies, for you can speak truth if you will. We boastourselves as even better men than our fathers; we took seven-gatedThebes, though the wall was stronger and our men were fewer in number,for we trusted in the omens of the gods and in the help of Jove,whereas they perished through their own sheer folly; hold not, then,our fathers in like honour with us.""

ííííDiomed looked sternly at him and said, ""Hold your peace, myfriend, as I bid you. It is not amiss that Agamemnon should urge theAchaeans forward, for the glory will be his if we take the city, andhis the shame if we are vanquished. Therefore let us acquitourselves with valour.""

ííííAs he spoke he sprang from his chariot, and his armour rang sofiercely about his body that even a brave man might well have beenscared to hear it.

ííííAs when some mighty wave that thunders on the beach when the westwind has lashed it into fury- it has reared its head afar and nowcomes crashing down on the shore; it bows its arching crest highover the jagged rocks and spews its salt foam in all directions-even so did the serried phalanxes of the Danaans march steadfastlyto battle. The chiefs gave orders each to his own people, but themen said never a word; no man would think it, for huge as the hostwas, it seemed as though there was not a tongue among them, sosilent were they in their obedience; and as they marched the armourabout their bodies glistened in the sun. But the clamour of the Trojanranks was as that of many thousand ewes that stand waiting to bemilked in the yards of some rich flockmaster, and bleat incessantly inanswer to the bleating of their lambs; for they had not one speech norlanguage, but their tongues were diverse, and they came from manydifferent places. These were inspired of Mars, but the others byMinerva- and with them came Panic, Rout, and Strife whose fury nevertires, sister and friend of murderous Mars, who, from being at firstbut low in stature, grows till she uprears her head to heaven,though her feet are still on earth. She it was that went about amongthem and flung down discord to the waxing of sorrow with even handbetween them.

ííííWhen they were got together in one place shield clashed withshield and spear with spear in the rage of battle. The bossedshields beat one upon another, and there was a tramp as of a greatmultitude- death-cry and shout of triumph of slain and slayers, andthe earth ran red with blood. As torrents swollen with rain coursemadly down their deep channels till the angry floods meet in somegorge, and the shepherd the hillside hears their roaring from afar-even such was the toil and uproar of the hosts as they joined inbattle.

ííííFirst Antilochus slew an armed warrior of the Trojans, Echepolus,son of Thalysius, fighting in the foremost ranks. He struck at theprojecting part of his helmet and drove the spear into his brow; thepoint of bronze pierced the bone, and darkness veiled his eyes;headlong as a tower he fell amid the press of the fight, and as hedropped King Elephenor, son of Chalcodon and captain of the proudAbantes began dragging him out of reach of the darts that were fallingaround him, in haste to strip him of his armour. But his purpose wasnot for long; Agenor saw him haling the body away, and smote him inthe side with his bronze-shod spear- for as he stooped his side wasleft unprotected by his shield- and thus he perished. Then the fightbetween Trojans and Achaeans grew furious over his body, and they flewupon each other like wolves, man and man crushing one upon the other.

ííííForthwith Ajax, son of Telamon, slew the fair youth Simoeisius,son of Anthemion, whom his mother bore by the banks of the Simois,as she was coming down from Mt. Ida, where she had been with herparents to see their flocks. Therefore he was named Simoeisius, but hedid not live to pay his parents for his rearing, for he was cut offuntimely by the spear of mighty Ajax, who struck him in the breastby the right nipple as he was coming on among the foremost fighters;the spear went right through his shoulder, and he fell as a poplarthat has grown straight and tall in a meadow by some mere, and its topis thick with branches. Then the wheelwright lays his axe to its rootsthat he may fashion a felloe for the wheel of some goodly chariot, andit lies seasoning by the waterside. In such wise did Ajax fell toearth Simoeisius, son of Anthemion. Thereon Antiphus of the gleamingcorslet, son of Priam, hurled a spear at Ajax from amid the crowdand missed him, but he hit Leucus, the brave comrade of Ulysses, inthe groin, as he was dragging the body of Simoeisius over to the otherside; so he fell upon the body and loosed his hold upon it. Ulysseswas furious when he saw Leucus slain, and strode in full armourthrough the front ranks till he was quite close; then he glaredround about him and took aim, and the Trojans fell back as he didso. His dart was not sped in vain, for it struck Democoon, the bastardson of Priam, who had come to him from Abydos, where he had chargeof his father's mares. Ulysses, infuriated by the death of hiscomrade, hit him with his spear on one temple, and the bronze pointcame through on the other side of his forehead. Thereon darknessveiled his eyes, and his armour rang rattling round him as he fellheavily to the ground. Hector, and they that were in front, thengave round while the Argives raised a shout and drew off the dead,pressing further forward as they did so. But Apollo looked down fromPergamus and called aloud to the Trojans, for he was displeased.""Trojans,"" he cried, ""rush on the foe, and do not let yourselves bethus beaten by the Argives. Their skins are not stone nor iron thatwhen hit them you do them no harm. Moreover, Achilles, the son oflovely Thetis, is not fighting, but is nursing his anger at theships.""

ííííThus spoke the mighty god, crying to them from the city, whileJove's redoubtable daughter, the Trito-born, went about among the hostof the Achaeans, and urged them forward whenever she beheld themslackening.

ííííThen fate fell upon Diores, son of Amarynceus, for he was struckby a jagged stone near the ancle of his right leg. He that hurled itwas Peirous, son of Imbrasus, captain of the Thracians, who had comefrom Aenus; the bones and both the tendons were crushed by thepitiless stone. He fell to the ground on his back, and in his deaththroes stretched out his hands towards his comrades. But Peirous,who had wounded him, sprang on him and thrust a spear into hisbelly, so that his bowels came gushing out upon the ground, anddarkness veiled his eyes. As he was leaving the body, Thoas of Aetoliastruck him in the chest near the nipple, and the point fixed itself inhis lungs. Thoas came close up to him, pulled the spear out of hischest, and then drawing his sword, smote him in the middle of thebelly so that he died; but he did not strip him of his armour, for hisThracian comrades, men who wear their hair in a tuft at the top oftheir heads, stood round the body and kept him off with their longspears for all his great stature and valour; so he was driven back.Thus the two corpses lay stretched on earth near to one another, theone captain of the Thracians and the other of the Epeans; and manyanother fell round them.

ííííAnd now no man would have made light of the fighting if he couldhave gone about among it scatheless and unwounded, with Minervaleading him by the hand, and protecting him from the storm of spearsand arrows. For many Trojans and Achaeans on that day lay stretchedside by side face downwards upon the earth.

ííííBOOK V

ííííThen Pallas Minerva put valour into the heart of Diomed, son ofTydeus, that he might excel all the other Argives, and cover himselfwith glory. She made a stream of fire flare from his shield and helmetlike the star that shines most brilliantly in summer after its bath inthe waters of Oceanus- even such a fire did she kindle upon his headand shoulders as she bade him speed into the thickest hurly-burly ofthe fight.

ííííNow there was a certain rich and honourable man among the Trojans,priest of Vulcan, and his name was Dares. He had two sons, Phegeus andIdaeus, both of them skilled in all the arts of war. These two cameforward from the main body of Trojans, and set upon Diomed, he beingon foot, while they fought from their chariot. When they were close upto one another, Phegeus took aim first, but his spear went overDiomed's left shoulder without hitting him. Diomed then threw, and hisspear sped not in vain, for it hit Phegeus on the breast near thenipple, and he fell from his chariot. Idaeus did not dare tobestride his brother's body, but sprang from the chariot and took toflight, or he would have shared his brother's fate; whereon Vulcansaved him by wrapping him in a cloud of darkness, that his oldfather might not be utterly overwhelmed with grief; but the son ofTydeus drove off with the horses, and bade his followers take themto the ships. The Trojans were scared when they saw the two sons ofDares, one of them in fright and the other lying dead by hischariot. Minerva, therefore, took Mars by the hand and said, ""Mars,Mars, bane of men, bloodstained stormer of cities, may we not nowleave the Trojans and Achaeans to fight it out, and see to which ofthe two Jove will vouchsafe the victory? Let us go away, and thusavoid his anger.""

ííííSo saying, she drew Mars out of the battle, and set him down uponthe steep banks of the Scamander. Upon this the Danaans drove theTrojans back, and each one of their chieftains killed his man. FirstKing Agamemnon flung mighty Odius, captain of the Halizoni, from hischariot. The spear of Agamemnon caught him on the broad of his back,just as he was turning in flight; it struck him between theshoulders and went right through his chest, and his armour rangrattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.

ííííThen Idomeneus killed Phaesus, son of Borus the Meonian, who hadcome from Varne. Mighty Idomeneus speared him on the right shoulder ashe was mounting his chariot, and the darkness of death enshroudedhim as he fell heavily from the car.

ííííThe squires of Idomeneus spoiled him of his armour, whileMenelaus, son of Atreus, killed Scamandrius the son of Strophius, amighty huntsman and keen lover of the chase. Diana herself hadtaught him how to kill every kind of wild creature that is bred inmountain forests, but neither she nor his famed skill in archery couldnow save him, for the spear of Menelaus struck him in the back as hewas flying; it struck him between the shoulders and went right throughhis chest, so that he fell headlong and his armour rang rattling roundhim.

ííííMeriones then killed Phereclus the son of Tecton, who was the son ofHermon, a man whose hand was skilled in all manner of cunningworkmanship, for Pallas Minerva had dearly loved him. He it was thatmade the ships for Alexandrus, which were the beginning of allmischief, and brought evil alike both on the Trojans and on Alexandrushimself; for he heeded not the decrees of heaven. Meriones overtookhim as he was flying, and struck him on the right buttock. The pointof the spear went through the bone into the bladder, and death cameupon him as he cried aloud and fell forward on his knees.

ííííMeges, moreover, slew Pedaeus, son of Antenor, who, though he wasa bastard, had been brought up by Theano as one of her own children,for the love she bore her husband. The son of Phyleus got close upto him and drove a spear into the nape of his neck: it went underhis tongue all among his teeth, so he bit the cold bronze, and felldead in the dust.

ííííAnd Eurypylus, son of Euaemon, killed Hypsenor, the son of nobleDolopion, who had been made priest of the river Scamander, and washonoured among the people as though he were a god. Eurypylus gavehim chase as he was flying before him, smote him with his sword uponthe arm, and lopped his strong hand from off it. The bloody handfell to the ground, and the shades of death, with fate that no man canwithstand, came over his eyes.

ííííThus furiously did the battle rage between them. As for the son ofTydeus, you could not say whether he was more among the Achaeans orthe Trojans. He rushed across the plain like a winter torrent that hasburst its barrier in full flood; no dykes, no walls of fruitfulvineyards can embank it when it is swollen with rain from heaven,but in a moment it comes tearing onward, and lays many a field wastethat many a strong man hand has reclaimed- even so were the densephalanxes of the Trojans driven in rout by the son of Tydeus, and manythough they were, they dared not abide his onslaught.

ííííNow when the son of Lycaon saw him scouring the plain and drivingthe Trojans pell-mell before him, he aimed an arrow and hit thefront part of his cuirass near the shoulder: the arrow went rightthrough the metal and pierced the flesh, so that the cuirass wascovered with blood. On this the son of Lycaon shouted in triumph,""Knights Trojans, come on; the bravest of the Achaeans is wounded, andhe will not hold out much longer if King Apollo was indeed with mewhen I sped from Lycia hither.""

ííííThus did he vaunt; but his arrow had not killed Diomed, who withdrewand made for the chariot and horses of Sthenelus, the son of Capaneus.""Dear son of Capaneus,"" said he, ""come down from your chariot, anddraw the arrow out of my shoulder.""

ííííSthenelus sprang from his chariot, and drew the arrow from thewound, whereon the blood came spouting out through the hole that hadbeen made in his shirt. Then Diomed prayed, saying, ""Hear me, daughterof aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, if ever you loved my father welland stood by him in the thick of a fight, do the like now by me; grantme to come within a spear's throw of that man and kill him. He hasbeen too quick for me and has wounded me; and now he is boastingthat I shall not see the light of the sun much longer.""

ííííThus he prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard him; she made his limbssupple and quickened his hands and his feet. Then she went up close tohim and said, ""Fear not, Diomed, to do battle with the Trojans, forI have set in your heart the spirit of your knightly father Tydeus.Moreover, I have withdrawn the veil from your eyes, that you know godsand men apart. If, then, any other god comes here and offers youbattle, do not fight him; but should Jove's daughter Venus come,strike her with your spear and wound her.""

ííííWhen she had said this Minerva went away, and the son of Tydeusagain took his place among the foremost fighters, three times morefierce even than he had been before. He was like a lion that somemountain shepherd has wounded, but not killed, as he is springing overthe wall of a sheep-yard to attack the sheep. The shepherd hasroused the brute to fury but cannot defend his flock, so he takesshelter under cover of the buildings, while the sheep,panic-stricken on being deserted, are smothered in heaps one on top ofthe other, and the angry lion leaps out over the sheep-yard wall. Eventhus did Diomed go furiously about among the Trojans.

ííííHe killed Astynous, and shepherd of his people, the one with athrust of his spear, which struck him above the nipple, the other witha sword- cut on the collar-bone, that severed his shoulder from hisneck and back. He let both of them lie, and went in pursuit of Abasand Polyidus, sons of the old reader of dreams Eurydamas: they nevercame back for him to read them any more dreams, for mighty Diomed madean end of them. He then gave chase to Xanthus and Thoon, the twosons of Phaenops, both of them very dear to him, for he was now wornout with age, and begat no more sons to inherit his possessions. ButDiomed took both their lives and left their father sorrowing bitterly,for he nevermore saw them come home from battle alive, and his kinsmendivided his wealth among themselves.

ííííThen he came upon two sons of Priam, Echemmon and Chromius, asthey were both in one chariot. He sprang upon them as a lion fastenson the neck of some cow or heifer when the herd is feeding in acoppice. For all their vain struggles he flung them both from theirchariot and stripped the armour from their bodies. Then he gavetheir horses to his comrades to take them back to the ships.

ííííWhen Aeneas saw him thus making havoc among the ranks, he wentthrough the fight amid the rain of spears to see if he could findPandarus. When he had found the brave son of Lycaon he said,""Pandarus, where is now your bow, your winged arrows, and yourrenown as an archer, in respect of which no man here can rival you noris there any in Lycia that can beat you? Lift then your hands toJove and send an arrow at this fellow who is going so masterfullyabout, and has done such deadly work among the Trojans. He haskilled many a brave man- unless indeed he is some god who is angrywith the Trojans about their sacrifices, and and has set his handagainst them in his displeasure.""

ííííAnd the son of Lycaon answered, ""Aeneas, I take him for none otherthan the son of Tydeus. I know him by his shield, the visor of hishelmet, and by his horses. It is possible that he may be a god, but ifhe is the man I say he is, he is not making all this havoc withoutheaven's help, but has some god by his side who is shrouded in a cloudof darkness, and who turned my arrow aside when it had hit him. I havetaken aim at him already and hit him on the right shoulder; my arrowwent through the breastpiece of his cuirass; and I made sure Ishould send him hurrying to the world below, but it seems that Ihave not killed him. There must be a god who is angry with me.Moreover I have neither horse nor chariot. In my father's stablesthere are eleven excellent chariots, fresh from the builder, quitenew, with cloths spread over them; and by each of them there stand apair of horses, champing barley and rye; my old father Lycaon urged meagain and again when I was at home and on the point of starting, totake chariots and horses with me that I might lead the Trojans inbattle, but I would not listen to him; it would have been muchbetter if I had done so, but I was thinking about the horses, whichhad been used to eat their fill, and I was afraid that in such a greatgathering of men they might be ill-fed, so I left them at home andcame on foot to Ilius armed only with my bow and arrows. These itseems, are of no use, for I have already hit two chieftains, thesons of Atreus and of Tydeus, and though I drew blood surely enough, Ihave only made them still more furious. I did ill to take my bowdown from its peg on the day I led my band of Trojans to Ilius inHector's service, and if ever I get home again to set eyes on mynative place, my wife, and the greatness of my house, may some one cutmy head off then and there if I do not break the bow and set it on ahot fire- such pranks as it plays me.""

ííííAeneas answered, ""Say no more. Things will not mend till we two goagainst this man with chariot and horses and bring him to a trial ofarms. Mount my chariot, and note how cleverly the horses of Tros canspeed hither and thither over the plain in pursuit or flight. IfJove again vouchsafes glory to the son of Tydeus they will carry ussafely back to the city. Take hold, then, of the whip and reinswhile I stand upon the car to fight, or else do you wait this man'sonset while I look after the horses.""

íííí""Aeneas."" replied the son of Lycaon, ""take the reins and drive; ifwe have to fly before the son of Tydeus the horses will go betterfor their own driver. If they miss the sound of your voice when theyexpect it they may be frightened, and refuse to take us out of thefight. The son of Tydeus will then kill both of us and take thehorses. Therefore drive them yourself and I will be ready for him withmy spear.""

ííííThey then mounted the chariot and drove full-speed towards the sonof Tydeus. Sthenelus, son of Capaneus, saw them coming and said toDiomed, ""Diomed, son of Tydeus, man after my own heart, I see twoheroes speeding towards you, both of them men of might the one askilful archer, Pandarus son of Lycaon, the other, Aeneas, whosesire is Anchises, while his mother is Venus. Mount the chariot and letus retreat. Do not, I pray you, press so furiously forward, or you mayget killed.""

ííííDiomed looked angrily at him and answered: ""Talk not of flight,for I shall not listen to you: I am of a race that knows neitherflight nor fear, and my limbs are as yet unwearied. I am in no mind tomount, but will go against them even as I am; Pallas Minerva bids mebe afraid of no man, and even though one of them escape, theirsteeds shall not take both back again. I say further, and lay mysaying to your heart- if Minerva sees fit to vouchsafe me the glory ofkilling both, stay your horses here and make the reins fast to the rimof the chariot; then be sure you spring Aeneas' horses and drivethem from the Trojan to the Achaean ranks. They are of the stockthat great Jove gave to Tros in payment for his son Ganymede, andare the finest that live and move under the sun. King Anchises stolethe blood by putting his mares to them without Laomedon's knowledge,and they bore him six foals. Four are still in his stables, but hegave the other two to Aeneas. We shall win great glory if we cantake them.""

ííííThus did they converse, but the other two had now driven close up tothem, and the son of Lycaon spoke first. ""Great and mighty son,""said he, ""of noble Tydeus, my arrow failed to lay you low, so I willnow try with my spear.""

ííííHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it from him. It struckthe shield of the son of Tydeus; the bronze point pierced it andpassed on till it reached the breastplate. Thereon the son of Lycaonshouted out and said, ""You are hit clean through the belly; you willnot stand out for long, and the glory of the fight is mine.""

ííííBut Diomed all undismayed made answer, ""You have missed, not hit,and before you two see the end of this matter one or other of youshall glut tough-shielded Mars with his blood.""

ííííWith this he hurled his spear, and Minerva guided it on toPandarus's nose near the eye. It went crashing in among his whiteteeth; the bronze point cut through the root of his to tongue,coming out under his chin, and his glistening armour rang rattlinground him as he fell heavily to the ground. The horses started asidefor fear, and he was reft of life and strength.

ííííAeneas sprang from his chariot armed with shield and spear,fearing lest the Achaeans should carry off the body. He bestrode it asa lion in the pride of strength, with shield and on spear before himand a cry of battle on his lips resolute to kill the first that shoulddare face him. But the son of Tydeus caught up a mighty stone, so hugeand great that as men now are it would take two to lift it;nevertheless he bore it aloft with ease unaided, and with this hestruck Aeneas on the groin where the hip turns in the joint that iscalled the ""cup-bone."" The stone crushed this joint, and broke boththe sinews, while its jagged edges tore away all the flesh. The herofell on his knees, and propped himself with his hand resting on theground till the darkness of night fell upon his eyes. And nowAeneas, king of men, would have perished then and there, had not hismother, Jove's daughter Venus, who had conceived him by Anchiseswhen he was herding cattle, been quick to mark, and thrown her twowhite arms about the body of her dear son. She protected him bycovering him with a fold of her own fair garment, lest some Danaanshould drive a spear into his breast and kill him.

ííííThus, then, did she bear her dear son out of the fight. But theson of Capaneus was not unmindful of the orders that Diomed hadgiven him. He made his own horses fast, away from the hurly-burly,by binding the reins to the rim of the chariot. Then he sprang uponAeneas's horses and drove them from the Trojan to the Achaean ranks.When he had so done he gave them over to his chosen comradeDeipylus, whom he valued above all others as the one who was mostlike-minded with himself, to take them on to the ships. He thenremounted his own chariot, seized the reins, and drove with allspeed in search of the son of Tydeus.

ííííNow the son of Tydeus was in pursuit of the Cyprian goddess, spearin hand, for he knew her to be feeble and not one of those goddessesthat can lord it among men in battle like Minerva or Enyo the wasterof cities, and when at last after a long chase he caught her up, heflew at her and thrust his spear into the flesh of her delicatehand. The point tore through the ambrosial robe which the Graces hadwoven for her, and pierced the skin between her wrist and the palmof her hand, so that the immortal blood, or ichor, that flows in theveins of the blessed gods, came pouring from the wound; for the godsdo not eat bread nor drink wine, hence they have no blood such asours, and are immortal. Venus screamed aloud, and let her son fall,but Phoebus Apollo caught him in his arms, and hid him in a cloud ofdarkness, lest some Danaan should drive a spear into his breast andkill him; and Diomed shouted out as he left her, ""Daughter of Jove,leave war and battle alone, can you not be contented with beguilingsilly women? If you meddle with fighting you will get what will makeyou shudder at the very name of war.""

ííííThe goddess went dazed and discomfited away, and Iris, fleet asthe wind, drew her from the throng, in pain and with her fair skin allbesmirched. She found fierce Mars waiting on the left of the battle,with his spear and his two fleet steeds resting on a cloud; whereonshe fell on her knees before her brother and implored him to let herhave his horses. ""Dear brother,"" she cried, ""save me, and give me yourhorses to take me to Olympus where the gods dwell. I am badlywounded by a mortal, the son of Tydeus, who would now fight evenwith father Jove.""

ííííThus she spoke, and Mars gave her his gold-bedizened steeds. Shemounted the chariot sick and sorry at heart, while Iris sat beside herand took the reins in her hand. She lashed her horses on and they flewforward nothing loth, till in a trice they were at high Olympus, wherethe gods have their dwelling. There she stayed them, unloosed themfrom the chariot, and gave them their ambrosial forage; but Venusflung herself on to the lap of her mother Dione, who threw her armsabout her and caressed her, saying, ""Which of the heavenly beingshas been treating you in this way, as though you had been doingsomething wrong in the face of day?""

ííííAnd laughter-loving Venus answered, ""Proud Diomed, the son ofTydeus, wounded me because I was bearing my dear son Aeneas, whom Ilove best of all mankind, out of the fight. The war is no longer onebetween Trojans and Achaeans, for the Danaans have now taken tofighting with the immortals.""

íííí""Bear it, my child,"" replied Dione, ""and make the best of it. Wedwellers in Olympus have to put up with much at the hands of men,and we lay much suffering on one another. Mars had to suffer when Otusand Ephialtes, children of Aloeus, bound him in cruel bonds, so thathe lay thirteen months imprisoned in a vessel of bronze. Mars wouldhave then perished had not fair Eeriboea, stepmother to the sons ofAloeus, told Mercury, who stole him away when he was already well-nighworn out by the severity of his bondage. Juno, again, suffered whenthe mighty son of Amphitryon wounded her on the right breast with athree-barbed arrow, and nothing could assuage her pain. So, also,did huge Hades, when this same man, the son of aegis-bearing Jove, hithim with an arrow even at the gates of hell, and hurt him badly.Thereon Hades went to the house of Jove on great Olympus, angry andfull of pain; and the arrow in his brawny shoulder caused him greatanguish till Paeeon healed him by spreading soothing herbs on thewound, for Hades was not of mortal mould. Daring, head-strong,evildoer who recked not of his sin in shooting the gods that dwellin Olympus. And now Minerva has egged this son of Tydeus on againstyourself, fool that he is for not reflecting that no man who fightswith gods will live long or hear his children prattling about hisknees when he returns from battle. Let, then, the son of Tydeus seethat he does not have to fight with one who is stronger than youare. Then shall his brave wife Aegialeia, daughter of Adrestus,rouse her whole house from sleep, wailing for the loss of her weddedlord, Diomed the bravest of the Achaeans.""

ííííSo saying, she wiped the ichor from the wrist of her daughter withboth hands, whereon the pain left her, and her hand was healed. ButMinerva and Juno, who were looking on, began to taunt Jove withtheir mocking talk, and Minerva was first to speak. ""Father Jove,""said she, ""do not be angry with me, but I think the Cyprian musthave been persuading some one of the Achaean women to go with theTrojans of whom she is so very fond, and while caressing one orother of them she must have torn her delicate hand with the gold pinof the woman's brooch.""

ííííThe sire of gods and men smiled, and called golden Venus to hisside. ""My child,"" said he, ""it has not been given you to be a warrior.Attend, henceforth, to your own delightful matrimonial duties, andleave all this fighting to Mars and to Minerva.""

ííííThus did they converse. But Diomed sprang upon Aeneas, though heknew him to be in the very arms of Apollo. Not one whit did he fearthe mighty god, so set was he on killing Aeneas and stripping him ofhis armour. Thrice did he spring forward with might and main to slayhim, and thrice did Apollo beat back his gleaming shield. When hewas coming on for the fourth time, as though he were a god, Apolloshouted to him with an awful voice and said, ""Take heed, son ofTydeus, and draw off; think not to match yourself against gods, formen that walk the earth cannot hold their own with the immortals.""

ííííThe son of Tydeus then gave way for a little space, to avoid theanger of the god, while Apollo took Aeneas out of the crowd and sethim in sacred Pergamus, where his temple stood. There, within themighty sanctuary, Latona and Diana healed him and made him glorious tobehold, while Apollo of the silver bow fashioned a wraith in thelikeness of Aeneas, and armed as he was. Round this the Trojans andAchaeans hacked at the bucklers about one another's breasts, hewingeach other's round shields and light hide-covered targets. ThenPhoebus Apollo said to Mars, ""Mars, Mars, bane of men, blood-stainedstormer of cities, can you not go to this man, the son of Tydeus,who would now fight even with father Jove, and draw him out of thebattle? He first went up to the Cyprian and wounded her in the handnear her wrist, and afterwards sprang upon me too, as though he were agod.""

ííííHe then took his seat on the top of Pergamus, while murderous Marswent about among the ranks of the Trojans, cheering them on, in thelikeness of fleet Acamas chief of the Thracians. ""Sons of Priam,"" saidhe, ""how long will you let your people be thus slaughtered by theAchaeans? Would you wait till they are at the walls of Troy? Aeneasthe son of Anchises has fallen, he whom we held in as high honour asHector himself. Help me, then, to rescue our brave comrade from thestress of the fight.""

ííííWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. ThenSarpedon rebuked Hector very sternly. ""Hector,"" said he, ""where isyour prowess now? You used to say that though you had neither peoplenor allies you could hold the town alone with your brothers andbrothers-in-law. I see not one of them here; they cower as houndsbefore a lion; it is we, your allies, who bear the brunt of thebattle. I have come from afar, even from Lycia and the banks of theriver Xanthus, where I have left my wife, my infant son, and muchwealth to tempt whoever is needy; nevertheless, I head my Lyciansoldiers and stand my ground against any who would fight me though Ihave nothing here for the Achaeans to plunder, while you look on,without even bidding your men stand firm in defence of their wives.See that you fall not into the hands of your foes as men caught in themeshes of a net, and they sack your fair city forthwith. Keep thisbefore your mind night and day, and beseech the captains of yourallies to hold on without flinching, and thus put away theirreproaches from you.""

ííííSo spoke Sarpedon, and Hector smarted under his words. He sprangfrom his chariot clad in his suit of armour, and went about amongthe host brandishing his two spears, exhorting the men to fight andraising the terrible cry of battle. Then they rallied and againfaced the Achaeans, but the Argives stood compact and firm, and werenot driven back. As the breezes sport with the chaff upon somegoodly threshing-floor, when men are winnowing- while yellow Ceresblows with the wind to sift the chaff from the grain, and the chaff-heaps grow whiter and whiter- even so did the Achaeans whiten in thedust which the horses' hoofs raised to the firmament of heaven, astheir drivers turned them back to battle, and they bore down withmight upon the foe. Fierce Mars, to help the Trojans, covered themin a veil of darkness, and went about everywhere among them,inasmuch as Phoebus Apollo had told him that when he saw Pallas,Minerva leave the fray he was to put courage into the hearts of theTrojans- for it was she who was helping the Danaans. Then Apollosent Aeneas forth from his rich sanctuary, and filled his heart withvalour, whereon he took his place among his comrades, who wereoverjoyed at seeing him alive, sound, and of a good courage; butthey could not ask him how it had all happened, for they were too busywith the turmoil raised by Mars and by Strife, who raged insatiably intheir midst.

ííííThe two Ajaxes, Ulysses and Diomed, cheered the Danaans on, fearlessof the fury and onset of the Trojans. They stood as still as cloudswhich the son of Saturn has spread upon the mountain tops when thereis no air and fierce Boreas sleeps with the other boisterous windswhose shrill blasts scatter the clouds in all directions- even sodid the Danaans stand firm and unflinching against the Trojans. Theson of Atreus went about among them and exhorted them. ""My friends,""said he, ""quit yourselves like brave men, and shun dishonour in oneanother's eyes amid the stress of battle. They that shun dishonourmore often live than get killed, but they that fly save neither lifenor name.""

ííííAs he spoke he hurled his spear and hit one of those who were in thefront rank, the comrade of Aeneas, Deicoon son of Pergasus, whom theTrojans held in no less honour than the sons of Priam, for he was everquick to place himself among the foremost. The spear of King Agamemnonstruck his shield and went right through it, for the shield stayedit not. It drove through his belt into the lower part of his belly,and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to theground.

ííííThen Aeneas killed two champions of the Danaans, Crethon andOrsilochus. Their father was a rich man who lived in the strong cityof Phere and was descended from the river Alpheus, whose broadstream flows through the land of the Pylians. The river begatOrsilochus, who ruled over much people and was father to Diocles,who in his turn begat twin sons, Crethon and Orsilochus, wellskilled in all the arts of war. These, when they grew up, went toIlius with the Argive fleet in the cause of Menelaus and Agamemnonsons of Atreus, and there they both of them fell. As two lions whomtheir dam has reared in the depths of some mountain forest toplunder homesteads and carry off sheep and cattle till they get killedby the hand of man, so were these two vanquished by Aeneas, and felllike high pine-trees to the ground.

ííííBrave Menelaus pitied them in their fall, and made his way to thefront, clad in gleaming bronze and brandishing his spear, for Marsegged him on to do so with intent that he should be killed byAeneas; but Antilochus the son of Nestor saw him and sprang forward,fearing that the king might come to harm and thus bring all theirlabour to nothing; when, therefore Aeneas and Menelaus were settingtheir hands and spears against one another eager to do battle,Antilochus placed himself by the side of Menelaus. Aeneas, bold thoughhe was, drew back on seeing the two heroes side by side in front ofhim, so they drew the bodies of Crethon and Orsilochus to the ranks ofthe Achaeans and committed the two poor fellows into the hands oftheir comrades. They then turned back and fought in the front ranks.

ííííThey killed Pylaemenes peer of Mars, leader of the Paphlagonianwarriors. Menelaus struck him on the collar-bone as he was standing onhis chariot, while Antilochus hit his charioteer and squire Mydon, theson of Atymnius, who was turning his horses in flight. He hit him witha stone upon the elbow, and the reins, enriched with white ivory, fellfrom his hands into the dust. Antilochus rushed towards him and struckhim on the temples with his sword, whereon he fell head first from thechariot to the ground. There he stood for a while with his head andshoulders buried deep in the dust- for he had fallen on sandy soiltill his horses kicked him and laid him flat on the ground, asAntilochus lashed them and drove them off to the host of the Achaeans.

ííííBut Hector marked them from across the ranks, and with a loud cryrushed towards them, followed by the strong battalions of the Trojans.Mars and dread Enyo led them on, she fraught with ruthless turmoilof battle, while Mars wielded a monstrous spear, and went about, nowin front of Hector and now behind him.

ííííDiomed shook with passion as he saw them. As a man crossing a wideplain is dismayed to find himself on the brink of some great riverrolling swiftly to the sea- he sees its boiling waters and starts backin fear- even so did the son of Tydeus give ground. Then he said tohis men, ""My friends, how can we wonder that Hector wields the spearso well? Some god is ever by his side to protect him, and now Marsis with him in the likeness of mortal man. Keep your faces thereforetowards the Trojans, but give ground backwards, for we dare notfight with gods.""

ííííAs he spoke the Trojans drew close up, and Hector killed two men,both in one chariot, Menesthes and Anchialus, heroes well versed inwar. Ajax son of Telamon pitied them in their fall; he came close upand hurled his spear, hitting Amphius the son of Selagus, a man ofgreat wealth who lived in Paesus and owned much corn-growing land, buthis lot had led him to come to the aid of Priam and his sons. Ajaxstruck him in the belt; the spear pierced the lower part of his belly,and he fell heavily to the ground. Then Ajax ran towards him tostrip him of his armour, but the Trojans rained spears upon him,many of which fell upon his shield. He planted his heel upon thebody and drew out his spear, but the darts pressed so heavily upon himthat he could not strip the goodly armour from his shoulders. TheTrojan chieftains, moreover, many and valiant, came about him withtheir spears, so that he dared not stay; great, brave and valiantthough he was, they drove him from them and he was beaten back.

ííííThus, then, did the battle rage between them. Presently the stronghand of fate impelled Tlepolemus, the son of Hercules, a man bothbrave and of great stature, to fight Sarpedon; so the two, son andgrandson of great Jove, drew near to one another, and Tlepolemus spokefirst. ""Sarpedon,"" said he, ""councillor of the Lycians, why should youcome skulking here you who are a man of peace? They lie who call youson of aegis-bearing Jove, for you are little like those who were ofold his children. Far other was Hercules, my own brave andlion-hearted father, who came here for the horses of Laomedon, andthough he had six ships only, and few men to follow him, sacked thecity of Ilius and made a wilderness of her highways. You are a coward,and your people are falling from you. For all your strength, and allyour coming from Lycia, you will be no help to the Trojans but willpass the gates of Hades vanquished by my hand.""

ííííAnd Sarpedon, captain of the Lycians, answered, ""Tlepolemus, yourfather overthrew Ilius by reason of Laomedon's folly in refusingpayment to one who had served him well. He would not give yourfather the horses which he had come so far to fetch. As foryourself, you shall meet death by my spear. You shall yield glory tomyself, and your soul to Hades of the noble steeds.""

ííííThus spoke Sarpedon, and Tlepolemus upraised his spear. They threwat the same moment, and Sarpedon struck his foe in the middle of histhroat; the spear went right through, and the darkness of death fellupon his eyes. Tlepolemus's spear struck Sarpedon on the left thighwith such force that it tore through the flesh and grazed the bone,but his father as yet warded off destruction from him.

ííííHis comrades bore Sarpedon out of the fight, in great pain by theweight of the spear that was dragging from his wound. They were insuch haste and stress as they bore him that no one thought ofdrawing the spear from his thigh so as to let him walk uprightly.Meanwhile the Achaeans carried off the body of Tlepolemus, whereonUlysses was moved to pity, and panted for the fray as he beheldthem. He doubted whether to pursue the son of Jove, or to makeslaughter of the Lycian rank and file; it was not decreed, however,that he should slay the son of Jove; Minerva, therefore, turned himagainst the main body of the Lycians. He killed Coeranus, Alastor,Chromius, Alcandrus, Halius, Noemon, and Prytanis, and would haveslain yet more, had not great Hector marked him, and sped to the frontof the fight clad in his suit of mail, filling the Danaans withterror. Sarpedon was glad when he saw him coming, and besought him,saying, ""Son of Priam, let me not he here to fall into the hands ofthe Danaans. Help me, and since I may not return home to gladden thehearts of my wife and of my infant son, let me die within the walls ofyour city.""

ííííHector made him no answer, but rushed onward to fall at once uponthe Achaeans and. kill many among them. His comrades then boreSarpedon away and laid him beneath Jove's spreading oak tree. Pelagon,his friend and comrade drew the spear out of his thigh, but Sarpedonfainted and a mist came over his eyes. Presently he came to himselfagain, for the breath of the north wind as it played upon him gave himnew life, and brought him out of the deep swoon into which he hadfallen.

ííííMeanwhile the Argives were neither driven towards their ships byMars and Hector, nor yet did they attack them; when they knew thatMars was with the Trojans they retreated, but kept their faces stillturned towards the foe. Who, then, was first and who last to beslain by Mars and Hector? They were valiant Teuthras, and Orestesthe renowned charioteer, Trechus the Aetolian warrior, Oenomaus,Helenus the son of Oenops, and Oresbius of the gleaming girdle, whowas possessed of great wealth, and dwelt by the Cephisian lake withthe other Boeotians who lived near him, owners of a fertile country.

ííííNow when the goddess Juno saw the Argives thus falling, she saidto Minerva, ""Alas, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, thepromise we made Menelaus that he should not return till he hadsacked the city of Ilius will be of none effect if we let Mars ragethus furiously. Let us go into the fray at once.""

ííííMinerva did not gainsay her. Thereon the august goddess, daughter ofgreat Saturn, began to harness her gold-bedizened steeds. Hebe withall speed fitted on the eight-spoked wheels of bronze that were oneither side of the iron axle-tree. The felloes of the wheels were ofgold, imperishable, and over these there was a tire of bronze,wondrous to behold. The naves of the wheels were silver, turning roundthe axle upon either side. The car itself was made with plaitedbands of gold and silver, and it had a double top-rail running allround it. From the body of the car there went a pole of silver, onto the end of which she bound the golden yoke, with the bands ofgold that were to go under the necks of the horses Then Juno put hersteeds under the yoke, eager for battle and the war-cry.

ííííMeanwhile Minerva flung her richly embroidered vesture, made withher own hands, on to her father's threshold, and donned the shirt ofJove, arming herself for battle. She threw her tasselled aegisabout. her shoulders, wreathed round with Rout as with a fringe, andon it were Strife, and Strength, and Panic whose blood runs cold;moreover there was the head of the dread monster Gorgon,, grim andawful to behold, portent of aegis-bearing Jove. On her head she sether helmet of gold, with four plumes, and coming to a peak both infront and behind- decked with the emblems of a hundred cities; thenshe stepped into her flaming chariot and grasped the spear, so stoutand sturdy and strong, with which she quells the ranks of heroes whohave displeased her. Juno lashed the horses on, and the gates ofheaven bellowed as they flew open of their own accord -gates overwhich the flours preside, in whose hands are Heaven and Olympus,either to open the dense cloud that hides them, or to close it.Through these the goddesses drove their obedient steeds, and found theson of Saturn sitting all alone on the topmost ridges of Olympus.There Juno stayed her horses, and spoke to Jove the son of Saturn,lord of all. ""Father Jove,"" said she, ""are you not angry with Mars forthese high doings? how great and goodly a host of the Achaeans hehas destroyed to my great grief, and without either right or reason,while the Cyprian and Apollo are enjoying it all at their ease andsetting this unrighteous madman on to do further mischief. I hope,Father Jove, that you will not be angry if I hit Mars hard, andchase him out of the battle.""

ííííAnd Jove answered, ""Set Minerva on to him, for she punishes him moreoften than any one else does.""

ííííJuno did as he had said. She lashed her horses, and they flewforward nothing loth midway betwixt earth and sky. As far as a man cansee when he looks out upon the sea from some high beacon, so far canthe loud-neighing horses of the gods spring at a single bound. Whenthey reached Troy and the place where its two flowing streams Simoisand Scamander meet, there Juno stayed them and took them from thechariot. She hid them in a thick cloud, and Simois made ambrosiaspring up for them to eat; the two goddesses then went on, flying liketurtledoves in their eagerness to help the Argives. When they cameto the part where the bravest and most in number were gathered aboutmighty Diomed, fighting like lions or wild boars of great strength andendurance, there Juno stood still and raised a shout like that ofbrazen-voiced Stentor, whose cry was as loud as that of fifty mentogether. ""Argives,"" she cried; ""shame on cowardly creatures, brave insemblance only; as long as Achilles was fighting, fi his spear wasso deadly that the Trojans dared not show themselves outside theDardanian gates, but now they sally far from the city and fight evenat your ships.""

ííííWith these words she put heart and soul into them all, while Minervasprang to the side of the son of Tydeus, whom she found near hischariot and horses, cooling the wound that Pandarus had given him. Forthe sweat caused by the hand that bore the weight of his shieldirritated the hurt: his arm was weary with pain, and he was lifting upthe strap to wipe away the blood. The goddess laid her hand on theyoke of his horses and said, ""The son of Tydeus is not such another ashis father. Tydeus was a little man, but he could fight, and rushedmadly into the fray even when I told him not to do so. When he wentall unattended as envoy to the city of Thebes among the Cadmeans, Ibade him feast in their houses and be at peace; but with that highspirit which was ever present with him, he challenged the youth of theCadmeans, and at once beat them in all that he attempted, somightily did I help him. I stand by you too to protect you, and Ibid you be instant in fighting the Trojans; but either you are tiredout, or you are afraid and out of heart, and in that case I say thatyou are no true son of Tydeus the son of Oeneus.""

ííííDiomed answered, ""I know you, goddess, daughter of aegis-bearingJove, and will hide nothing from you. I am not afraid nor out ofheart, nor is there any slackness in me. I am only following yourown instructions; you told me not to fight any of the blessed gods;but if Jove's daughter Venus came into battle I was to wound herwith my spear. Therefore I am retreating, and bidding the otherArgives gather in this place, for I know that Mars is now lording itin the field.""

íííí""Diomed, son of Tydeus,"" replied Minerva, ""man after my own heart,fear neither Mars nor any other of the immortals, for I willbefriend you. Nay, drive straight at Mars, and smite him in closecombat; fear not this raging madman, villain incarnate, first on oneside and then on the other. But now he was holding talk with Junoand myself, saying he would help the Argives and attack the Trojans;nevertheless he is with the Trojans, and has forgotten the Argives.""

ííííWith this she caught hold of Sthenelus and lifted him off thechariot on to the ground. In a second he was on the ground,whereupon the goddess mounted the car and placed herself by the sideof Diomed. The oaken axle groaned aloud under the burden of theawful goddess and the hero; Pallas Minerva took the whip and reins,and drove straight at Mars. He was in the act of stripping hugePeriphas, son of Ochesius and bravest of the Aetolians. Bloody Marswas stripping him of his armour, and Minerva donned the helmet ofHades, that he might not see her; when, therefore, he saw Diomed, hemade straight for him and let Periphas lie where he had fallen. Assoon as they were at close quarters he let fly with his bronze spearover the reins and yoke, thinking to take Diomed's life, but Minervacaught the spear in her hand and made it fly harmlessly over thechariot. Diomed then threw, and Pallas Minerva drove the spear intothe pit of Mars's stomach where his under-girdle went round him. ThereDiomed wounded him, tearing his fair flesh and then drawing hisspear out again. Mars roared as loudly as nine or ten thousand menin the thick of a fight, and the Achaeans and Trojans were struck withpanic, so terrible was the cry he raised.

ííííAs a dark cloud in the sky when it comes on to blow after heat, evenso did Diomed son of Tydeus see Mars ascend into the broad heavens.With all speed he reached high Olympus, home of the gods, and in greatpain sat down beside Jove the son of Saturn. He showed Jove theimmortal blood that was flowing from his wound, and spoke piteously,saying, ""Father Jove, are you not angered by such doings? We godsare continually suffering in the most cruel manner at one another'shands while helping mortals; and we all owe you a grudge for havingbegotten that mad termagant of a daughter, who is always committingoutrage of some kind. We other gods must all do as you bid us, but heryou neither scold nor punish; you encourage her because thepestilent creature is your daughter. See how she has been incitingproud Diomed to vent his rage on the immortal gods. First he went upto the Cyprian and wounded her in the hand near her wrist, and then hesprang upon me too as though he were a god. Had I not run for it Imust either have lain there for long enough in torments among theghastly corpes, or have been eaten alive with spears till I had nomore strength left in me.""

ííííJove looked angrily at him and said, ""Do not come whining here,Sir Facing-bothways. I hate you worst of all the gods in Olympus,for you are ever fighting and making mischief. You have theintolerable and stubborn spirit of your mother Juno: it is all I cando to manage her, and it is her doing that you are now in this plight:still, I cannot let you remain longer in such great pain; you are myown off-spring, and it was by me that your mother conceived you; if,however, you had been the son of any other god, you are so destructivethat by this time you should have been lying lower than the Titans.""

ííííHe then bade Paeeon heal him, whereon Paeeon spread pain-killingherbs upon his wound and cured him, for he was not of mortal mould. Asthe juice of the fig-tree curdles milk, and thickens it in a momentthough it is liquid, even so instantly did Paeeon cure fierce Mars.Then Hebe washed him, and clothed him in goodly raiment, and he tookhis seat by his father Jove all glorious to behold.

ííííBut Juno of Argos and Minerva of Alalcomene, now that they had put astop to the murderous doings of Mars, went back again to the houseof Jove.

ííííBOOK VI

ííííTHE fight between Trojans and Achaeans was now left to rage as itwould, and the tide of war surged hither and thither over the plain asthey aimed their bronze-shod spears at one another between the streamsof Simois and Xanthus.

ííííFirst, Ajax son of Telamon, tower of strength to the Achaeans, brokea phalanx of the Trojans, and came to the assistance of his comradesby killing Acamas son of Eussorus, the best man among the Thracians,being both brave and of great stature. The spear struck the projectingpeak of his helmet: its bronze point then went through his foreheadinto the brain, and darkness veiled his eyes.

ííííThen Diomed killed Axylus son of Teuthranus, a rich man who lived inthe strong city of Arisbe, and was beloved by all men; for he had ahouse by the roadside, and entertained every one who passed; howbeitnot one of his guests stood before him to save his life, and Diomedkilled both him and his squire Calesius, who was then hischarioteer- so the pair passed beneath the earth.

ííííEuryalus killed Dresus and Opheltius, and then went in pursuit ofAesepus and Pedasus, whom the naiad nymph Abarbarea had borne to nobleBucolion. Bucolion was eldest son to Laomedon, but he was a bastard.While tending his sheep he had converse with the nymph, and sheconceived twin sons; these the son of Mecisteus now slew, and hestripped the armour from their shoulders. Polypoetes then killedAstyalus, Ulysses Pidytes of Percote, and Teucer Aretaon. Ablerus fellby the spear of Nestor's son Antilochus, and Agamemnon, king of men,killed Elatus who dwelt in Pedasus by the banks of the riverSatnioeis. Leitus killed Phylacus as he was flying, and Eurypylus slewMelanthus.

ííííThen Menelaus of the loud war-cry took Adrestus alive, for hishorses ran into a tamarisk bush, as they were flying wildly over theplain, and broke the pole from the car; they went on towards thecity along with the others in full flight, but Adrestus rolled out,and fell in the dust flat on his face by the wheel of his chariot;Menelaus came up to him spear in hand, but Adrestus caught him bythe knees begging for his life. ""Take me alive,"" he cried, ""son ofAtreus, and you shall have a full ransom for me: my father is rich andhas much treasure of gold, bronze, and wrought iron laid by in hishouse. From this store he will give you a large ransom should hehear of my being alive and at the ships of the Achaeans.""

ííííThus did he plead, and Menelaus was for yielding and giving him to asquire to take to the ships of the Achaeans, but Agamemnon camerunning up to him and rebuked him. ""My good Menelaus,"" said he,""this is no time for giving quarter. Has, then, your house fared sowell at the hands of the Trojans? Let us not spare a single one ofthem- not even the child unborn and in its mother's womb; let not aman of them be left alive, but let all in Ilius perish, unheeded andforgotten.""

ííííThus did he speak, and his brother was persuaded by him, for hiswords were just. Menelaus, therefore, thrust Adrestus from him,whereon King Agamemnon struck him in the flank, and he fell: thenthe son of Atreus planted his foot upon his breast to draw his spearfrom the body.

ííííMeanwhile Nestor shouted to the Argives, saying, ""My friends, Danaanwarriors, servants of Mars, let no man lag that he may spoil the dead,and bring back much booty to the ships. Let us kill as many as we can;the bodies will lie upon the plain, and you can despoil them laterat your leisure.""

ííííWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. And now theTrojans would have been routed and driven back into Ilius, had notPriam's son Helenus, wisest of augurs, said to Hector and Aeneas,""Hector and Aeneas, you two are the mainstays of the Trojans andLycians, for you are foremost at all times, alike in fight andcounsel; hold your ground here, and go about among the host to rallythem in front of the gates, or they will fling themselves into thearms of their wives, to the great joy of our foes. Then, when you haveput heart into all our companies, we will stand firm here and fightthe Danaans however hard they press us, for there is nothing else tobe done. Meanwhile do you, Hector, go to the city and tell ourmother what is happening. Tell her to bid the matrons gather at thetemple of Minerva in the acropolis; let her then take her key and openthe doors of the sacred building; there, upon the knees of Minerva,let her lay the largest, fairest robe she has in her house- the oneshe sets most store by; let her, moreover, promise to sacrifice twelveyearling heifers that have never yet felt the goad, in the temple ofthe goddess, if she will take pity on the town, with the wives andlittle ones of the Trojans, and keep the son of Tydeus from falling onthe goodly city of Ilius; for he fights with fury and fills men'ssouls with panic. I hold him mightiest of them all; we did not feareven their great champion Achilles, son of a goddess though he be,as we do this man: his rage is beyond all bounds, and there is nonecan vie with him in prowess""

ííííHector did as his brother bade him. He sprang from his chariot,and went about everywhere among the host, brandishing his spears,urging the men on to fight, and raising the dread cry of battle.Thereon they rallied and again faced the Achaeans, who gave ground andceased their murderous onset, for they deemed that some one of theimmortals had come down from starry heaven to help the Trojans, sostrangely had they rallied. And Hector shouted to the Trojans,""Trojans and allies, be men, my friends, and fight with might andmain, while I go to Ilius and tell the old men of our council andour wives to pray to the gods and vow hecatombs in their honour.""

ííííWith this he went his way, and the black rim of hide that went roundhis shield beat against his neck and his ancles.

ííííThen Glaucus son of Hippolochus, and the son of Tydeus went into theopen space between the hosts to fight in single combat. When they wereclose up to one another Diomed of the loud war-cry was the first tospeak. ""Who, my good sir,"" said he, ""who are you among men? I havenever seen you in battle until now, but you are daring beyond allothers if you abide my onset. Woe to those fathers whose sons facemy might. If, however, you are one of the immortals and have come downfrom heaven, I will not fight you; for even valiant Lycurgus, son ofDryas, did not live long when he took to fighting with the gods. He itwas that drove the nursing women who were in charge of frenziedBacchus through the land of Nysa, and they flung their thyrsi on theground as murderous Lycurgus beat them with his oxgoad. Bacchushimself plunged terror-stricken into the sea, and Thetis took him toher bosom to comfort him, for he was scared by the fury with which theman reviled him. Thereon the gods who live at ease were angry withLycurgus and the son of Saturn struck him blind, nor did he livemuch longer after he had become hateful to the immortals. ThereforeI will not fight with the blessed gods; but if you are of them thateat the fruit of the ground, draw near and meet your doom.""

ííííAnd the son of Hippolochus answered, son of Tydeus, why ask me of mylineage? Men come and go as leaves year by year upon the trees.Those of autumn the wind sheds upon the ground, but when springreturns the forest buds forth with fresh vines. Even so is it with thegenerations of mankind, the new spring up as the old are passing away.If, then, you would learn my descent, it is one that is well knownto many. There is a city in the heart of Argos, pasture land ofhorses, called Ephyra, where Sisyphus lived, who was the craftiestof all mankind. He was the son of Aeolus, and had a son named Glaucus,who was father to Bellerophon, whom heaven endowed with the mostsurpassing comeliness and beauty. But Proetus devised his ruin, andbeing stronger than he, drove him from the land of the Argives, overwhich Jove had made him ruler. For Antea, wife of Proetus, lustedafter him, and would have had him lie with her in secret; butBellerophon was an honourable man and would not, so she told liesabout him to Proteus. 'Proetus,' said she, 'kill Bellerophon or die,for he would have had converse with me against my will.' The kingwas angered, but shrank from killing Bellerophon, so he sent him toLycia with lying letters of introduction, written on a foldedtablet, and containing much ill against the bearer. He badeBellerophon show these letters to his father-in-law, to the end thathe might thus perish; Bellerophon therefore went to Lycia, and thegods convoyed him safely.

íííí""When he reached the river Xanthus, which is in Lycia, the kingreceived him with all goodwill, feasted him nine days, and killed nineheifers in his honour, but when rosy-fingered morning appeared uponthe tenth day, he questioned him and desired to see the letter fromhis son-in-law Proetus. When he had received the wicked letter hefirst commanded Bellerophon to kill that savage monster, the Chimaera,who was not a human being, but a goddess, for she had the head of alion and the tail of a serpent, while her body was that of a goat, andshe breathed forth flames of fire; but Bellerophon slew her, for hewas guided by signs from heaven. He next fought the far-famedSolymi, and this, he said, was the hardest of all his battles.Thirdly, he killed the Amazons, women who were the peers of men, andas he was returning thence the king devised yet another plan for hisdestruction; he picked the bravest warriors in all Lycia, and placedthem in ambuscade, but not a man ever came back, for Bellerophonkilled every one of them. Then the king knew that he must be thevaliant offspring of a god, so he kept him in Lycia, gave him hisdaughter in marriage, and made him of equal honour in the kingdom withhimself; and the Lycians gave him a piece of land, the best in all thecountry, fair with vineyards and tilled fields, to have and to hold.

íííí""The king's daughter bore Bellerophon three children, Isander,Hippolochus, and Laodameia. Jove, the lord of counsel, lay withLaodameia, and she bore him noble Sarpedon; but when Bellerophoncame to be hated by all the gods, he wandered all desolate anddismayed upon the Alean plain, gnawing at his own heart, andshunning the path of man. Mars, insatiate of battle, killed his sonIsander while he was fighting the Solymi; his daughter was killed byDiana of the golden reins, for she was angered with her; butHippolochus was father to myself, and when he sent me to Troy he urgedme again and again to fight ever among the foremost and outvie mypeers, so as not to shame the blood of my fathers who were the noblestin Ephyra and in all Lycia. This, then, is the descent I claim.""

ííííThus did he speak, and the heart of Diomed was glad. He plantedhis spear in the ground, and spoke to him with friendly words. ""Then,""he said, you are an old friend of my father's house. Great Oeneus onceentertained Bellerophon for twenty days, and the two exchangedpresents. Oeneus gave a belt rich with purple, and Bellerophon adouble cup, which I left at home when I set out for Troy. I do notremember Tydeus, for he was taken from us while I was yet a child,when the army of the Achaeans was cut to pieces before Thebes.Henceforth, however, I must be your host in middle Argos, and you minein Lycia, if I should ever go there; let us avoid one another's spearseven during a general engagement; there are many noble Trojans andallies whom I can kill, if I overtake them and heaven delivers theminto my hand; so again with yourself, there are many Achaeans whoselives you may take if you can; we two, then, will exchange armour,that all present may know of the old ties that subsist between us.""

ííííWith these words they sprang from their chariots, grasped oneanother's hands, and plighted friendship. But the son of Saturn madeGlaucus take leave of his wits, for he exchanged golden armour forbronze, the worth of a hundred head of cattle for the worth of nine.

ííííNow when Hector reached the Scaean gates and the oak tree, the wivesand daughters of the Trojans came running towards him to ask aftertheir sons, brothers, kinsmen, and husbands: he told them to set aboutpraying to the gods, and many were made sorrowful as they heard him.

ííííPresently he reached the splendid palace of King Priam, adorned withcolonnades of hewn stone. In it there were fifty bedchambers- all ofhewn stone- built near one another, where the sons of Priam slept,each with his wedded wife. Opposite these, on the other side thecourtyard, there were twelve upper rooms also of hewn stone forPriam's daughters, built near one another, where his sons-in-law sleptwith their wives. When Hector got there, his fond mother came up tohim with Laodice the fairest of her daughters. She took his handwithin her own and said, ""My son, why have you left the battle to comehither? Are the Achaeans, woe betide them, pressing you hard about thecity that you have thought fit to come and uplift your hands to Jovefrom the citadel? Wait till I can bring you wine that you may makeoffering to Jove and to the other immortals, and may then drink and berefreshed. Wine gives a man fresh strength when he is wearied, asyou now are with fighting on behalf of your kinsmen.""

ííííAnd Hector answered, ""Honoured mother, bring no wine, lest you unmanme and I forget my strength. I dare not make a drink-offering toJove with unwashed hands; one who is bespattered with blood andfilth may not pray to the son of Saturn. Get the matrons together, andgo with offerings to the temple of Minerva driver of the spoil; there,upon the knees of Minerva, lay the largest and fairest robe you havein your house- the one you set most store by; promise, moreover, tosacrifice twelve yearling heifers that have never yet felt the goad,in the temple of the goddess if she will take pity on the town, withthe wives and little ones of the Trojans, and keep the son of Tydeusfrom off the goodly city of Ilius, for he fights with fury, andfills men's souls with panic. Go, then, to the temple of Minerva,while I seek Paris and exhort him, if he will hear my words. Wouldthat the earth might open her jaws and swallow him, for Jove bredhim to be the bane of the Trojans, and of Priam and Priam's sons.Could I but see him go down into the house of Hades, my heart wouldforget its heaviness.""

ííííHis mother went into the house and called her waiting-women whogathered the matrons throughout the city. She then went down intoher fragrant store-room, where her embroidered robes were kept, thework of Sidonian women, whom Alexandrus had brought over from Sidonwhen he sailed the seas upon that voyage during which he carried offHelen. Hecuba took out the largest robe, and the one that was mostbeautifully enriched with embroidery, as an offering to Minerva: itglittered like a star, and lay at the very bottom of the chest. Withthis she went on her way and many matrons with her.

ííííWhen they reached the temple of Minerva, lovely Theano, daughterof Cisseus and wife of Antenor, opened the doors, for the Trojanshad made her priestess of Minerva. The women lifted up their handsto the goddess with a loud cry, and Theano took the robe to lay itupon the knees of Minerva, praying the while to the daughter ofgreat Jove. ""Holy Minerva,"" she cried, ""protectress of our city,mighty goddess, break the spear of Diomed and lay him low before theScaean gates. Do this, and we will sacrifice twelve heifers thathave never yet known the goad, in your temple, if you will have pityupon the town, with the wives and little ones If the Trojans."" Thusshe prayed, but Pallas Minerva granted not her prayer.

ííííWhile they were thus praying to the daughter of great Jove, Hectorwent to the fair house of Alexandrus, which he had built for him bythe foremost builders in the land. They had built him his house,storehouse, and courtyard near those of Priam and Hector on theacropolis. Here Hector entered, with a spear eleven cubits long in hishand; the bronze point gleamed in front of him, and was fastened tothe shaft of the spear by a ring of gold. He found Alexandrus withinthe house, busied about his armour, his shield and cuirass, andhandling his curved bow; there, too, sat Argive Helen with herwomen, setting them their several tasks; and as Hector saw him herebuked him with words of scorn. ""Sir,"" said he, ""you do ill tonurse this rancour; the people perish fighting round this our town;you would yourself chide one whom you saw shirking his part in thecombat. Up then, or ere long the city will be in a blaze.""

ííííAnd Alexandrus answered, ""Hector, your rebuke is just; listentherefore, and believe me when I tell you that I am not here so muchthrough rancour or ill-will towards the Trojans, as from a desire toindulge my grief. My wife was even now gently urging me to battle, andI hold it better that I should go, for victory is ever fickle. Wait,then, while I put on my armour, or go first and I will follow. I shallbe sure to overtake you.""

ííííHector made no answer, but Helen tried to soothe him. ""Brother,""said she, ""to my abhorred and sinful self, would that a whirlwindhad caught me up on the day my mother brought me forth, and hadborne me to some mountain or to the waves of the roaring sea thatshould have swept me away ere this mischief had come about. But, sincethe gods have devised these evils, would, at any rate, that I had beenwife to a better man- to one who could smart under dishonour and men'sevil speeches. This fellow was never yet to be depended upon, nornever will be, and he will surely reap what he has sown. Still,brother, come in and rest upon this seat, for it is you who bear thebrunt of that toil that has been caused by my hateful self and bythe sin of Alexandrus- both of whom Jove has doomed to be a theme ofsong among those that shall be born hereafter.""

ííííAnd Hector answered, ""Bid me not be seated, Helen, for all thegoodwill you bear me. I cannot stay. I am in haste to help theTrojans, who miss me greatly when I am not among them; but urge yourhusband, and of his own self also let him make haste to overtake mebefore I am out of the city. I must go home to see my household, mywife and my little son, for I know not whether I shall ever againreturn to them, or whether the gods will cause me to fill by the handsof the Achaeans.""

ííííThen Hector left her, and forthwith was at his own house. He did notfind Andromache, for she was on the wall with her child and one of hermaids, weeping bitterly. Seeing, then, that she was not within, hestood on the threshold of the women's rooms and said, ""Women, tell me,and tell me true, where did Andromache go when she left the house? Wasit to my sisters, or to my brothers' wives? or is she at the temple ofMinerva where the other women are propitiating the awful goddess?""

ííííHis good housekeeper answered, ""Hector, since you bid me tell youtruly, she did not go to your sisters nor to your brothers' wives, noryet to the temple of Minerva, where the other women are propitiatingthe awful goddess, but she is on the high wall of Ilius, for she hadheard the Trojans were being hard pressed, and that the Achaeanswere in great force: she went to the wall in frenzied haste, and thenurse went with her carrying the child.""

ííííHector hurried from the house when she had done speaking, and wentdown the streets by the same way that he had come. When he had gonethrough the city and had reached the Scaean gates through which hewould go out on to the plain, his wife came running towards him,Andromache, daughter of great Eetion who ruled in Thebe under thewooded slopes of Mt. Placus, and was king of the Cilicians. Hisdaughter had married Hector, and now came to meet him with a nurse whocarried his little child in her bosom- a mere babe. Hector's darlingson, and lovely as a star. Hector had named him Scamandrius, but thepeople called him Astyanax, for his father stood alone as chiefguardian of Ilius. Hector smiled as he looked upon the boy, but he didnot speak, and Andromache stood by him weeping and taking his handin her own. ""Dear husband,"" said she, ""your valour will bring you todestruction; think on your infant son, and on my hapless self whoere long shall be your widow- for the Achaeans will set upon you ina body and kill you. It would be better for me, should I lose you,to lie dead and buried, for I shall have nothing left to comfort mewhen you are gone, save only sorrow. I have neither father normother now. Achilles slew my father when he sacked Thebe the goodlycity of the Cilicians. He slew him, but did not for very shame despoilhim; when he had burned him in his wondrous armour, he raised a barrowover his ashes and the mountain nymphs, daughters of aegis-bearingJove, planted a grove of elms about his tomb. I had seven brothersin my father's house, but on the same day they all went within thehouse of Hades. Achilles killed them as they were with their sheep andcattle. My mother- her who had been queen of all the land under Mt.Placus- he brought hither with the spoil, and freed her for a greatsum, but the archer- queen Diana took her in the house of your father.Nay- Hector- you who to me are father, mother, brother, and dearhusband- have mercy upon me; stay here upon this wall; make not yourchild fatherless, and your wife a widow; as for the host, place themnear the fig-tree, where the city can be best scaled, and the wallis weakest. Thrice have the bravest of them come thither andassailed it, under the two Ajaxes, Idomeneus, the sons of Atreus,and the brave son of Tydeus, either of their own bidding, or becausesome soothsayer had told them.""

ííííAnd Hector answered, ""Wife, I too have thought upon all this, butwith what face should I look upon the Trojans, men or women, if Ishirked battle like a coward? I cannot do so: I know nothing save tofight bravely in the forefront of the Trojan host and win renown alikefor my father and myself. Well do I know that the day will surely comewhen mighty Ilius shall be destroyed with Priam and Priam's people,but I grieve for none of these- not even for Hecuba, nor King Priam,nor for my brothers many and brave who may fall in the dust beforetheir foes- for none of these do I grieve as for yourself when the dayshall come on which some one of the Achaeans shall rob you for ever ofyour freedom, and bear you weeping away. It may be that you willhave to ply the loom in Argos at the bidding of a mistress, or tofetch water from the springs Messeis or Hypereia, treated brutallyby some cruel task-master; then will one say who sees you weeping,'She was wife to Hector, the bravest warrior among the Trojansduring the war before Ilius.' On this your tears will break forth anewfor him who would have put away the day of captivity from you. May Ilie dead under the barrow that is heaped over my body ere I hearyour cry as they carry you into bondage.""

ííííHe stretched his arms towards his child, but the boy cried andnestled in his nurse's bosom, scared at the sight of his father'sarmour, and at the horse-hair plume that nodded fiercely from hishelmet. His father and mother laughed to see him, but Hector tookthe helmet from his head and laid it all gleaming upon the ground.Then he took his darling child, kissed him, and dandled him in hisarms, praying over him the while to Jove and to all the gods.""Jove,"" he cried, ""grant that this my child may be even as myself,chief among the Trojans; let him be not less excellent in strength,and let him rule Ilius with his might. Then may one say of him as hecomes from battle, 'The son is far better than the father.' May hebring back the blood-stained spoils of him whom he has laid low, andlet his mother's heart be glad.'""

ííííWith this he laid the child again in the arms of his wife, whotook him to her own soft bosom, smiling through her tears. As herhusband watched her his heart yearned towards her and he caressedher fondly, saying, ""My own wife, do not take these things toobitterly to heart. No one can hurry me down to Hades before my time,but if a man's hour is come, be he brave or be he coward, there isno escape for him when he has once been born. Go, then, within thehouse, and busy yourself with your daily duties, your loom, yourdistaff, and the ordering of your servants; for war is man's matter,and mine above all others of them that have been born in Ilius.""

ííííHe took his plumed helmet from the ground, and his wife went backagain to her house, weeping bitterly and often looking back towardshim. When she reached her home she found her maidens within, andbade them all join in her lament; so they mourned Hector in his ownhouse though he was yet alive, for they deemed that they shouldnever see him return safe from battle, and from the furious hands ofthe Achaeans.

ííííParis did not remain long in his house. He donned his goodlyarmour overlaid with bronze, and hasted through the city as fast ashis feet could take him. As a horse, stabled and fed, breaks loose andgallops gloriously over the plain to the place where he is wont tobathe in the fair-flowing river- he holds his head high, and hismane streams upon his shoulders as he exults in his strength and flieslike the wind to the haunts and feeding ground of the mares- even sowent forth Paris from high Pergamus, gleaming like sunlight in hisarmour, and he laughed aloud as he sped swiftly on his way.Forthwith he came upon his brother Hector, who was then turning awayfrom the place where he had held converse with his wife, and he washimself the first to speak. ""Sir,"" said he, ""I fear that I have keptyou waiting when you are in haste, and have not come as quickly as youbade me.""

íííí""My good brother,"" answered Hector, you fight bravely, and no manwith any justice can make light of your doings in battle. But youare careless and wilfully remiss. It grieves me to the heart to hearthe ill that the Trojans speak about you, for they have sufferedmuch on your account. Let us be going, and we will make things righthereafter, should Jove vouchsafe us to set the cup of ourdeliverance before ever-living gods of heaven in our own homes, whenwe have chased the Achaeans from Troy.""

ííííBOOK VII

ííííWITH these words Hector passed through the gates, and his brotherAlexandrus with him, both eager for the fray. As when heaven sends abreeze to sailors who have long looked for one in vain, and havelaboured at their oars till they are faint with toil, even sowelcome was the sight of these two heroes to the Trojans.

ííííThereon Alexandrus killed Menesthius the son of Areithous; helived in Ame, and was son of Areithous the Mace-man, and ofPhylomedusa. Hector threw a spear at Eioneus and struck him deadwith a wound in the neck under the bronze rim of his helmet.Glaucus, moreover, son of Hippolochus, captain of the Lycians, in hardhand-to-hand fight smote Iphinous son of Dexius on the shoulder, as hewas springing on to his chariot behind his fleet mares; so he fellto earth from the car, and there was no life left in him.

ííííWhen, therefore, Minerva saw these men making havoc of theArgives, she darted down to Ilius from the summits of Olympus, andApollo, who was looking on from Pergamus, went out to meet her; for hewanted the Trojans to be victorious. The pair met by the oak tree, andKing Apollo son of Jove was first to speak. ""What would you havesaid he, ""daughter of great Jove, that your proud spirit has sentyou hither from Olympus? Have you no pity upon the Trojans, andwould you incline the scales of victory in favour of the Danaans?Let me persuade you- for it will be better thus- stay the combat forto-day, but let them renew the fight hereafter till they compass thedoom of Ilius, since you goddesses have made up your minds todestroy the city.""

ííííAnd Minerva answered, ""So be it, Far-Darter; it was in this mindthat I came down from Olympus to the Trojans and Achaeans. Tell me,then, how do you propose to end this present fighting?""

ííííApollo, son of Jove, replied, ""Let us incite great Hector tochallenge some one of the Danaans in single combat; on this theAchaeans will be shamed into finding a man who will fight him.""

ííííMinerva assented, and Helenus son of Priam divined the counsel ofthe gods; he therefore went up to Hector and said, ""Hector son ofPriam, peer of gods in counsel, I am your brother, let me thenpersuade you. Bid the other Trojans and Achaeans all of them taketheir seats, and challenge the best man among the Achaeans to meet youin single combat. I have heard the voice of the ever-living gods,and the hour of your doom is not yet come.""

ííííHector was glad when he heard this saying, and went in among theTrojans, grasping his spear by the middle to hold them back, andthey all sat down. Agamemnon also bade the Achaeans be seated. ButMinerva and Apollo, in the likeness of vultures, perched on fatherJove's high oak tree, proud of their men; and the ranks sat closeranged together, bristling with shield and helmet and spear. As whenthe rising west wind furs the face of the sea and the waters grow darkbeneath it, so sat the companies of Trojans and Achaeans upon theplain. And Hector spoke thus:-

íííí""Hear me, Trojans and Achaeans, that I may speak even as I amminded; Jove on his high throne has brought our oaths and covenants tonothing, and foreshadows ill for both of us, till you either takethe towers of Troy, or are yourselves vanquished at your ships. Theprinces of the Achaeans are here present in the midst of you; let him,then, that will fight me stand forward as your champion againstHector. Thus I say, and may Jove be witness between us. If yourchampion slay me, let him strip me of my armour and take it to yourships, but let him send my body home that the Trojans and theirwives may give me my dues of fire when I am dead. In like manner, ifApollo vouchsafe me glory and I slay your champion, I will strip himof his armour and take it to the city of Ilius, where I will hang itin the temple of Apollo, but I will give up his body, that theAchaeans may bury him at their ships, and the build him a mound by thewide waters of the Hellespont. Then will one say hereafter as he sailshis ship over the sea, 'This is the monument of one who died longsince a champion who was slain by mighty Hector.' Thus will one say,and my fame shall not be lost.""

ííííThus did he speak, but they all held their peace, ashamed to declinethe challenge, yet fearing to accept it, till at last Menelaus roseand rebuked them, for he was angry. ""Alas,"" he cried, ""vain braggarts,women forsooth not men, double-dyed indeed will be the stain upon usif no man of the Danaans will now face Hector. May you be turned everyman of you into earth and water as you sit spiritless and ingloriousin your places. I will myself go out against this man, but theupshot of the fight will be from on high in the hands of theimmortal gods.""

ííííWith these words he put on his armour; and then, O Menelaus, yourlife would have come to an end at the hands of hands of Hector, for hewas far better the man, had not the princes of the Achaeans sprungupon you and checked you. King Agamemnon caught him by the righthand and said, ""Menelaus, you are mad; a truce to this folly. Bepatient in spite of passion, do not think of fighting a man so muchstronger than yourself as Hector son of Priam, who is feared by manyanother as well as you. Even Achilles, who is far more doughty thanyou are, shrank from meeting him in battle. Sit down your ownpeople, and the Achaeans will send some other champion to fightHector; fearless and fond of battle though he be, I ween his kneeswill bend gladly under him if he comes out alive from thehurly-burly of this fight.""

ííííWith these words of reasonable counsel he persuaded his brother,whereon his squires gladly stripped the armour from off his shoulders.Then Nestor rose and spoke, ""Of a truth,"" said he, ""the Achaean landis fallen upon evil times. The old knight Peleus, counsellor andorator among the Myrmidons, loved when I was in his house toquestion me concerning the race and lineage of all the Argives. Howwould it not grieve him could he hear of them as now quailing beforeHector? Many a time would he lift his hands in prayer that his soulmight leave his body and go down within the house of Hades. Would,by father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that I were still young andstrong as when the Pylians and Arcadians were gathered in fight by therapid river Celadon under the walls of Pheia, and round about thewaters of the river Iardanus. The godlike hero Ereuthalion stoodforward as their champion, with the armour of King Areithous uponhis shoulders- Areithous whom men and women had surnamed 'theMace-man,' because he fought neither with bow nor spear, but broke thebattalions of the foe with his iron mace. Lycurgus killed him, notin fair fight, but by entrapping him in a narrow way where his maceserved him in no stead; for Lycurgus was too quick for him and spearedhim through the middle, so he fell to earth on his back. Lycurgus thenspoiled him of the armour which Mars had given him, and bore it inbattle thenceforward; but when he grew old and stayed at home, he gaveit to his faithful squire Ereuthalion, who in this same armourchallenged the foremost men among us. The others quaked and quailed,but my high spirit bade me fight him though none other wouldventure; I was the youngest man of them all; but when I fought himMinerva vouchsafed me victory. He was the biggest and strongest manthat ever I killed, and covered much ground as he lay sprawling uponthe earth. Would that I were still young and strong as I then was, forthe son of Priam would then soon find one who would face him. But you,foremost among the whole host though you be, have none of you anystomach for fighting Hector.""

ííííThus did the old man rebuke them, and forthwith nine men startedto their feet. Foremost of all uprose King Agamemnon, and after himbrave Diomed the son of Tydeus. Next were the two Ajaxes, menclothed in valour as with a garment, and then Idomeneus, andMeriones his brother in arms. After these Eurypylus son of Euaemon,Thoas the son of Andraemon, and Ulysses also rose. Then Nestorknight of Gerene again spoke, saying: ""Cast lots among you to seewho shall be chosen. If he come alive out of this fight he will havedone good service alike to his own soul and to the Achaeans.""

ííííThus he spoke, and when each of them had marked his lot, and hadthrown it into the helmet of Agamemnon son of Atreus, the peoplelifted their hands in prayer, and thus would one of them say as helooked into the vault of heaven, ""Father Jove, grant that the lot fallon Ajax, or on the son of Tydeus, or upon the king of rich Mycenehimself.""

ííííAs they were speaking, Nestor knight of Gerene shook the helmet, andfrom it there fell the very lot which they wanted- the lot of Ajax.The herald bore it about and showed it to all the chieftains of theAchaeans, going from left to right; but they none of of them owned it.When, however, in due course he reached the man who had written uponit and had put it into the helmet, brave Ajax held out his hand, andthe herald gave him the lot. When Ajax saw him mark he knew it and wasglad; he threw it to the ground and said, ""My friends, the lot ismine, and I rejoice, for I shall vanquish Hector. I will put on myarmour; meanwhile, pray to King Jove in silence among yourselvesthat the Trojans may not hear you- or aloud if you will, for we fearno man. None shall overcome me, neither by force nor cunning, for Iwas born and bred in Salamis, and can hold my own in all things.""

ííííWith this they fell praying to King Jove the son of Saturn, and thuswould one of them say as he looked into the vault of heaven, ""FatherJove that rulest from Ida, most glorious in power, vouchsafe victoryto Ajax, and let him win great glory: but if you wish well to Hectoralso and would protect him, grant to each of them equal fame andprowess.

ííííThus they prayed, and Ajax armed himself in his suit of gleamingbronze. When he was in full array he sprang forward as monstrousMars when he takes part among men whom Jove has set fighting withone another- even so did huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans, springforward with a grim smile on his face as he brandished his longspear and strode onward. The Argives were elated as they beheld him,but the Trojans trembled in every limb, and the heart even of Hectorbeat quickly, but he could not now retreat and withdraw into the ranksbehind him, for he had been the challenger. Ajax came up bearing hisshield in front of him like a wall- a shield of bronze with sevenfolds of oxhide- the work of Tychius, who lived in Hyle and was by farthe best worker in leather. He had made it with the hides of sevenfull-fed bulls, and over these he had set an eighth layer of bronze.Holding this shield before him, Ajax son of Telamon came close up toHector, and menaced him saying, ""Hector, you shall now learn, man toman, what kind of champions the Danaans have among them even besideslion-hearted Achilles cleaver of the ranks of men. He now abides atthe ships in anger with Agamemnon shepherd of his people, but thereare many of us who are well able to face you; therefore begin thefight.""

ííííAnd Hector answered, ""Noble Ajax, son of Telamon, captain of thehost, treat me not as though I were some puny boy or woman that cannotfight. I have been long used to the blood and butcheries of battle.I am quick to turn my leathern shield either to right or left, forthis I deem the main thing in battle. I can charge among thechariots and horsemen, and in hand to hand fighting can delight theheart of Mars; howbeit I would not take such a man as you are offhis guard- but I will smite you openly if I can.""

ííííHe poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it from him. It struckthe sevenfold shield in its outermost layer- the eighth, which wasof bronze- and went through six of the layers but in the seventhhide it stayed. Then Ajax threw in his turn, and struck the roundshield of the son of Priam. The terrible spear went through hisgleaming shield, and pressed onward through his cuirass of cunningworkmanship; it pierced the shirt against his side, but he swerved andthus saved his life. They then each of them drew out the spear fromhis shield, and fell on one another like savage lions or wild boars ofgreat strength and endurance: the son of Priam struck the middle ofAjax's shield, but the bronze did not break, and the point of his dartwas turned. Ajax then sprang forward and pierced the shield of Hector;the spear went through it and staggered him as he was springingforward to attack; it gashed his neck and the blood came pouringfrom the wound, but even so Hector did not cease fighting; he gaveground, and with his brawny hand seized a stone, rugged and huge, thatwas lying upon the plain; with this he struck the shield of Ajax onthe boss that was in its middle, so that the bronze rang again. ButAjax in turn caught up a far larger stone, swung it aloft, andhurled it with prodigious force. This millstone of a rock brokeHector's shield inwards and threw him down on his back with the shieldcrushing him under it, but Apollo raised him at once. Thereon theywould have hacked at one another in close combat with their swords,had not heralds, messengers of gods and men, come forward, one fromthe Trojans and the other from the Achaeans- Talthybius and Idaeusboth of them honourable men; these parted them with their staves,and the good herald Idaeus said, ""My sons, fight no longer, you areboth of you valiant, and both are dear to Jove; we know this; butnight is now falling, and the behests of night may not be wellgainsaid.""

ííííAjax son of Telamon answered, ""Idaeus, bid Hector say so, for it washe that challenged our princes. Let him speak first and I willaccept his saying.""

ííííThen Hector said, ""Ajax, heaven has vouchsafed you stature andstrength, and judgement; and in wielding the spear you excel allothers of the Achaeans. Let us for this day cease fighting;hereafter we will fight anew till heaven decide between us, and givevictory to one or to the other; night is now falling, and thebehests of night may not be well gainsaid. Gladden, then, the heartsof the Achaeans at your ships, and more especially those of your ownfollowers and clansmen, while I, in the great city of King Priam,bring comfort to the Trojans and their women, who vie with one anotherin their prayers on my behalf. Let us, moreover, exchange presentsthat it may be said among the Achaeans and Trojans, 'They foughtwith might and main, but were reconciled and parted in friendship.'

ííííOn this he gave Ajax a silver-studded sword with its sheath andleathern baldric, and in return Ajax gave him a girdle dyed withpurple. Thus they parted, the one going to the host of the Achaeans,and the other to that of the Trojans, who rejoiced when they saw theirhero come to them safe and unharmed from the strong hands of mightyAjax. They led him, therefore, to the city as one that had beensaved beyond their hopes. On the other side the Achaeans broughtAjax elated with victory to Agamemnon.

ííííWhen they reached the quarters of the son of Atreus, Agamemnonsacrificed for them a five-year-old bull in honour of Jove the sonof Saturn. They flayed the carcass, made it ready, and divided it intojoints; these they cut carefully up into smaller pieces, puttingthem on the spits, roasting them sufficiently, and then drawing themoff. When they had done all this and had prepared the feast, theyate it, and every man had his full and equal share, so that all weresatisfied, and King Agamemnon gave Ajax some slices cut lengthwaysdown the loin, as a mark of special honour. As soon as they had hadenough to cat and drink, old Nestor whose counsel was ever truestbegan to speak; with all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, headdressed them thus:-

íííí""Son of Atreus, and other chieftains, inasmuch as many of theAchaeans are now dead, whose blood Mars has shed by the banks of theScamander, and their souls have gone down to the house of Hades, itwill be well when morning comes that we should cease fighting; we willthen wheel our dead together with oxen and mules and burn them not farfrom the ships, that when we sail hence we may take the bones of ourcomrades home to their children. Hard by the funeral pyre we willbuild a barrow that shall be raised from the plain for all incommon; near this let us set about building a high wall, to shelterourselves and our ships, and let it have well-made gates that theremay be a way through them for our chariots. Close outside we willdig a deep trench all round it to keep off both horse and foot, thatthe Trojan chieftains may not bear hard upon us.""

ííííThus he spoke, and the princess shouted in applause. Meanwhile theTrojans held a council, angry and full of discord, on the acropolis bythe gates of King Priam's palace; and wise Antenor spoke. ""Hear mehe said, ""Trojans, Dardanians, and allies, that I may speak even asI am minded. Let us give up Argive Helen and her wealth to the sons ofAtreus, for we are now fighting in violation of our solemncovenants, and shall not prosper till we have done as I say.""

ííííHe then sat down and Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen rose tospeak. ""Antenor,"" said he, ""your words are not to my liking; you canfind a better saying than this if you will; if, however, you havespoken in good earnest, then indeed has heaven robbed you of yourreason. I will speak plainly, and hereby notify to the Trojans thatI will not give up the woman; but the wealth that I brought homewith her from Argos I will restore, and will add yet further of myown.""

ííííOn this, when Paris had spoken and taken his seat, Priam of the raceof Dardanus, peer of gods in council, rose and with all sincerityand goodwill addressed them thus: ""Hear me, Trojans, Dardanians, andallies, that I may speak even as I am minded. Get your suppers nowas hitherto throughout the city, but keep your watches and be wakeful.At daybreak let Idaeus go to the ships, and tell Agamemnon andMenelaus sons of Atreus the saying of Alexandrus through whom thisquarrel has come about; and let him also be instant with them thatthey now cease fighting till we burn our dead; hereafter we will fightanew, till heaven decide between us and give victory to one or tothe other.""

ííííThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. They tooksupper in their companies and at daybreak Idaeus went his wa to theships. He found the Danaans, servants of Mars, in council at the sternof Agamemnon's ship, and took his place in the midst of them. ""Sonof Atreus,"" he said, ""and princes of the Achaean host, Priam and theother noble Trojans have sent me to tell you the saying ofAlexandrus through whom this quarrel has come about, if so be that youmay find it acceptable. All the treasure he took with him in his shipsto Troy- would that he had sooner perished- he will restore, andwill add yet further of his own, but he will not give up the weddedwife of Menelaus, though the Trojans would have him do so. Priambade me inquire further if you will cease fighting till we burn ourdead; hereafter we will fight anew, till heaven decide between usand give victory to one or to the other.""

ííííThey all held their peace, but presently Diomed of the loudwar-cry spoke, saying, ""Let there be no taking, neither treasure,nor yet Helen, for even a child may see that the doom of the Trojansis at hand.""

ííííThe sons of the Achaeans shouted applause at the words that Diomedhad spoken, and thereon King Agamemnon said to Idaeus, ""Idaeus, youhave heard the answer the Achaeans make you-and I with them. But asconcerning the dead, I give you leave to burn them, for when men areonce dead there should be no grudging them the rites of fire. Let Jovethe mighty husband of Juno be witness to this covenant.""

ííííAs he spoke he upheld his sceptre in the sight of all the gods,and Idaeus went back to the strong city of Ilius. The Trojans andDardanians were gathered in council waiting his return; when hecame, he stood in their midst and delivered his message. As soon asthey heard it they set about their twofold labour, some to gatherthe corpses, and others to bring in wood. The Argives on their partalso hastened from their ships, some to gather the corpses, and othersto bring in wood.

ííííThe sun was beginning to beat upon the fields, fresh risen intothe vault of heaven from the slow still currents of deep Oceanus, whenthe two armies met. They could hardly recognise their dead, but theywashed the clotted gore from off them, shed tears over them, andlifted them upon their waggons. Priam had forbidden the Trojans towail aloud, so they heaped their dead sadly and silently upon thepyre, and having burned them went back to the city of Ilius. TheAchaeans in like manner heaped their dead sadly and silently on thepyre, and having burned them went back to their ships.

ííííNow in the twilight when it was not yet dawn, chosen bands of theAchaeans were gathered round the pyre and built one barrow that wasraised in common for all, and hard by this they built a high wall toshelter themselves and their ships; they gave it strong gates thatthere might be a way through them for their chariots, and closeoutside it they dug a trench deep and wide, and they planted it withinwith stakes.

ííííThus did the Achaeans toil, and the gods, seated by the side of Jovethe lord of lightning, marvelled at their great work; but Neptune,lord of the earthquake, spoke, saying, ""Father Jove, what mortal inthe whole world will again take the gods into his counsel? See you nothow the Achaeans have built a wall about their ships and driven atrench all round it, without offering hecatombs to the gods? The Thefame of this wall will reach as far as dawn itself, and men will nolonger think anything of the one which Phoebus Apollo and myself builtwith so much labour for Laomedon.""

ííííJove was displeased and answered, ""What, O shaker of the earth,are you talking about? A god less powerful than yourself might bealarmed at what they are doing, but your fame reaches as far as dawnitself. Surely when the Achaeans have gone home with their ships,you can shatter their wall and Ring it into the sea; you can cover thebeach with sand again, and the great wall of the Achaeans will then beutterly effaced.""

ííííThus did they converse, and by sunset the work of the Achaeans wascompleted; they then slaughtered oxen at their tents and got theirsupper. Many ships had come with wine from Lemnos, sent by Euneusthe son of Jason, born to him by Hypsipyle. The son of Jason freightedthem with ten thousand measures of wine, which he sent specially tothe sons of Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaus. From this supply theAchaeans bought their wine, some with bronze, some with iron, somewith hides, some with whole heifers, and some again with captives.They spread a goodly banquet and feasted the whole night through, asalso did the Trojans and their allies in the city. But all the timeJove boded them ill and roared with his portentous thunder. Palefear got hold upon them, and they spilled the wine from their cupson to the ground, nor did any dare drink till he had made offerings tothe most mighty son of Saturn. Then they laid themselves down torest and enjoyed the boon of sleep.

ííííBOOK VIII

ííííNOW when Morning, clad in her robe of saffron, had begun to suffuselight over the earth, Jove called the gods in council on the topmostcrest of serrated Olympus. Then he spoke and all the other gods gaveear. ""Hear me,"" said he, ""gods and goddesses, that I may speak even asI am minded. Let none of you neither goddess nor god try to crossme, but obey me every one of you that I may bring this matter to anend. If I see anyone acting apart and helping either Trojans orDanaans, he shall be beaten inordinately ere he come back again toOlympus; or I will hurl him down into dark Tartarus far into thedeepest pit under the earth, where the gates are iron and the floorbronze, as far beneath Hades as heaven is high above the earth, thatyou may learn how much the mightiest I am among you. Try me and findout for yourselves. Hangs me a golden chain from heaven, and layhold of it all of you, gods and goddesses together- tug as you will,you will not drag Jove the supreme counsellor from heaven to earth;but were I to pull at it myself I should draw you up with earth andsea into the bargain, then would I bind the chain about somepinnacle of Olympus and leave you all dangling in the mid firmament.So far am I above all others either of gods or men.""

ííííThey were frightened and all of them of held their peace, for he hadspoken masterfully; but at last Minerva answered, ""Father, son ofSaturn, king of kings, we all know that your might is not to begainsaid, but we are also sorry for the Danaan warriors, who areperishing and coming to a bad end. We will, however, since you sobid us, refrain from actual fighting, but we will make serviceablesuggestions to the Argives that they may not all of them perish inyour displeasure.""

ííííJove smiled at her and answered, ""Take heart, my child,Trito-born; I am not really in earnest, and I wish to be kind to you.""

ííííWith this he yoked his fleet horses, with hoofs of bronze andmanes of glittering gold. He girded himself also with gold about thebody, seized his gold whip and took his seat in his chariot. Thereonhe lashed his horses and they flew forward nothing loth midway twixtearth and starry heaven. After a while he reached many-fountained Ida,mother of wild beasts, and Gargarus, where are his grove andfragrant altar. There the father of gods and men stayed his horses,took them from the chariot, and hid them in a thick cloud; then hetook his seat all glorious upon the topmost crests, looking downupon the city of Troy and the ships of the Achaeans.

ííííThe Achaeans took their morning meal hastily at the ships, andafterwards put on their armour. The Trojans on the other hand likewisearmed themselves throughout the city, fewer in numbers butnevertheless eager perforce to do battle for their wives and children.All the gates were flung wide open, and horse and foot sallied forthwith the tramp as of a great multitude.

ííííWhen they were got together in one place, shield clashed withshield, and spear with spear, in the conflict of mail-clad men. Mightywas the din as the bossed shields pressed hard on one another-death- cry and shout of triumph of slain and slayers, and the earthran red with blood.

ííííNow so long as the day waxed and it was still morning theirweapons beat against one another, and the people fell, but when thesun had reached mid-heaven, the sire of all balanced his goldenscales, and put two fates of death within them, one for the Trojansand the other for the Achaeans. He took the balance by the middle, andwhen he lifted it up the day of the Achaeans sank; the death-fraughtscale of the Achaeans settled down upon the ground, while that ofthe Trojans rose heavenwards. Then he thundered aloud from Ida, andsent the glare of his lightning upon the Achaeans; when they saw this,pale fear fell upon them and they were sore afraid.

ííííIdomeneus dared not stay nor yet Agamemnon, nor did the twoAjaxes, servants of Mars, hold their ground. Nestor knight of Gerenealone stood firm, bulwark of the Achaeans, not of his own will, butone of his horses was disabled. Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen hadhit it with an arrow just on the top of its head where the mane beginsto grow away from the skull, a very deadly place. The horse bounded inhis anguish as the arrow pierced his brain, and his struggles threwothers into confusion. The old man instantly began cutting thetraces with his sword, but Hector's fleet horses bore down upon himthrough the rout with their bold charioteer, even Hector himself,and the old man would have perished there and then had not Diomed beenquick to mark, and with a loud cry called Ulysses to help him.

íííí""Ulysses,"" he cried, ""noble son of Laertes where are you flyingto, with your back turned like a coward? See that you are not struckwith a spear between the shoulders. Stay here and help me to defendNestor from this man's furious onset.""

ííííUlysses would not give ear, but sped onward to the ships of theAchaeans, and the son of Tydeus flinging himself alone into thethick of the fight took his stand before the horses of the son ofNeleus. ""Sir,"" said he, ""these young warriors are pressing you hard,your force is spent, and age is heavy upon you, your squire is naught,and your horses are slow to move. Mount my chariot and see what thehorses of Tros can do- how cleverly they can scud hither and thitherover the plain either in flight or in pursuit. I took them from thehero Aeneas. Let our squires attend to your own steeds, but let usdrive mine straight at the Trojans, that Hector may learn howfuriously I too can wield my spear.""

ííííNestor knight of Gerene hearkened to his words. Thereon thedoughty squires, Sthenelus and kind-hearted Eurymedon, saw to Nestor'shorses, while the two both mounted Diomed's chariot. Nestor took thereins in his hands and lashed the horses on; they were soon close upwith Hector, and the son of Tydeus aimed a spear at him as he wascharging full speed towards them. He missed him, but struck hischarioteer and squire Eniopeus son of noble Thebaeus in the breastby the nipple while the reins were in his hands, so that he died thereand then, and the horses swerved as he fell headlong from the chariot.Hector was greatly grieved at the loss of his charioteer, but lethim lie for all his sorrow, while he went in quest of anotherdriver; nor did his steeds have to go long without one, for hepresently found brave Archeptolemus the son of Iphitus, and made himget up behind the horses, giving the reins into his hand.

ííííAll had then been lost and no help for it, for they would havebeen penned up in Ilius like sheep, had not the sire of gods and menbeen quick to mark, and hurled a fiery flaming thunderbolt whichfell just in front of Diomed's horses with a flare of burningbrimstone. The horses were frightened and tried to back beneath thecar, while the reins dropped from Nestor's hands. Then he was afraidand said to Diomed, ""Son of Tydeus, turn your horses in flight; seeyou not that the hand of Jove is against you? To-day he vouchsafesvictory to Hector; to-morrow, if it so please him, he will again grantit to ourselves; no man, however brave, may thwart the purpose ofJove, for he is far stronger than any.""

ííííDiomed answered, ""All that you have said is true; there is a griefhowever which pierces me to the very heart, for Hector will talk amongthe Trojans and say, 'The son of Tydeus fled before me to theships.' This is the vaunt he will make, and may earth then swallowme.""

íííí""Son of Tydeus,"" replied Nestor, ""what mean you? Though Hector saythat you are a coward the Trojans and Dardanians will not believe him,nor yet the wives of the mighty warriors whom you have laid low.""

ííííSo saying he turned the horses back through the thick of the battle,and with a cry that rent the air the Trojans and Hector rained theirdarts after them. Hector shouted to him and said, ""Son of Tydeus,the Danaans have done you honour hitherto as regards your place attable, the meals they give you, and the filling of your cup with wine.Henceforth they will despise you, for you are become no better thana woman. Be off, girl and coward that you are, you shall not scale ourwalls through any Hinching upon my part; neither shall you carry offour wives in your ships, for I shall kill you with my own hand.""

ííííThe son of Tydeus was in two minds whether or no to turn hishorses round again and fight him. Thrice did he doubt, and thricedid Jove thunder from the heights of. Ida in token to the Trojans thathe would turn the battle in their favour. Hector then shouted tothem and said, ""Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians, lovers of closefighting, be men, my friends, and fight with might and with main; Isee that Jove is minded to vouchsafe victory and great glory tomyself, while he will deal destruction upon the Danaans. Fools, forhaving thought of building this weak and worthless wall. It shallnot stay my fury; my horses will spring lightly over their trench, andwhen I am BOOK at their ships forget not to bring me fire that I mayburn them, while I slaughter the Argives who will be all dazed andbewildered by the smoke.""

ííííThen he cried to his horses, ""Xanthus and Podargus, and you Aethonand goodly Lampus, pay me for your keep now and for all thehoney-sweet corn with which Andromache daughter of great Eetion hasfed you, and for she has mixed wine and water for you to drinkwhenever you would, before doing so even for me who am her ownhusband. Haste in pursuit, that we may take the shield of Nestor,the fame of which ascends to heaven, for it is of solid gold, arm-rodsand all, and that we may strip from the shoulders of Diomed. thecuirass which Vulcan made him. Could we take these two things, theAchaeans would set sail in their ships this self-same night.""

ííííThus did he vaunt, but Queen Juno made high Olympus quake as sheshook with rage upon her throne. Then said she to the mighty god ofNeptune, ""What now, wide ruling lord of the earthquake? Can you findno compassion in your heart for the dying Danaans, who bring youmany a welcome offering to Helice and to Aegae? Wish them well then.If all of us who are with the Danaans were to drive the Trojans backand keep Jove from helping them, he would have to sit there sulkingalone on Ida.""

ííííKing Neptune was greatly troubled and answered, ""Juno, rash oftongue, what are you talking about? We other gods must not setourselves against Jove, for he is far stronger than we are.""

ííííThus did they converse; but the whole space enclosed by the ditch,from the ships even to the wall, was filled with horses andwarriors, who were pent up there by Hector son of Priam, now thatthe hand of Jove was with him. He would even have set fire to theships and burned them, had not Queen Juno put it into the mind ofAgamemnon, to bestir himself and to encourage the Achaeans. To thisend he went round the ships and tents carrying a great purple cloak,and took his stand by the huge black hull of Ulysses' ship, whichwas middlemost of all; it was from this place that his voice wouldcarry farthest, on the one hand towards the tents of Ajax son ofTelamon, and on the other towards those of Achilles- for these twoheroes, well assured of their own strength, had valorously drawn uptheir ships at the two ends of the line. From this spot then, with avoice that could be heard afar, he shouted to the Danaans, saying,""Argives, shame on you cowardly creatures, brave in semblance only;where are now our vaunts that we should prove victorious- the vauntswe made so vaingloriously in Lemnos, when we ate the flesh of hornedcattle and filled our mixing-bowls to the brim? You vowed that youwould each of you stand against a hundred or two hundred men, andnow you prove no match even for one- for Hector, who will be erelong setting our ships in a blaze. Father Jove, did you ever so ruin agreat king and rob him so utterly of his greatness? yet, when to mysorrow I was coming hither, I never let my ship pass your altarswithout offering the fat and thigh-bones of heifers upon every oneof them, so eager was I to sack the city of Troy. Vouchsafe me thenthis prayer- suffer us to escape at any rate with our lives, and letnot the Achaeans be so utterly vanquished by the Trojans.""

ííííThus did he pray, and father Jove pitying his tears vouchsafed himthat his people should live, not die; forthwith he sent them an eagle,most unfailingly portentous of all birds, with a young fawn in itstalons; the eagle dropped the fawn by the altar on which theAchaeans sacrificed to Jove the lord of omens; When, therefore, thepeople saw that the bird had come from Jove, they sprang more fiercelyupon the Trojans and fought more boldly.

ííííThere was no man of all the many Danaans who could then boast thathe had driven his horses over the trench and gone forth to fightsooner than the son of Tydeus; long before any one else could do so heslew an armed warrior of the Trojans, Agelaus the son of Phradmon.He had turned his horses in flight, but the spear struck him in theback midway between his shoulders and went right through his chest,and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell forward from hischariot.

ííííAfter him came Agamemnon and Menelaus, sons of Atreus, the twoAjaxes clothed in valour as with a garment, Idomeneus and hiscompanion in arms Meriones, peer of murderous Mars, and Eurypylusthe brave son of Euaemon. Ninth came Teucer with his bow, and took hisplace under cover of the shield of Ajax son of Telamon. When Ajaxlifted his shield Teucer would peer round, and when he had hit any onein the throng, the man would fall dead; then Teucer would hie backto Ajax as a child to its mother, and again duck down under hisshield.

ííííWhich of the Trojans did brave Teucer first kill? Orsilochus, andthen Ormenus and Ophelestes, Daetor, Chromius, and godlikeLycophontes, Amopaon son of Polyaemon, and Melanippus. these in turndid he lay low upon the earth, and King Agamemnon was glad when he sawhim making havoc of the Trojans with his mighty bow. He went up to himand said, ""Teucer, man after my own heart, son of Telamon, captainamong the host, shoot on, and be at once the saving of the Danaans andthe glory of your father Telamon, who brought you up and took careof you in his own house when you were a child, bastard though youwere. Cover him with glory though he is far off; I will promise andI will assuredly perform; if aegis-bearing Jove and Minerva grant meto sack the city of Ilius, you shall have the next best meed of honourafter my own- a tripod, or two horses with their chariot, or a womanwho shall go up into your bed.""

ííííAnd Teucer answered, ""Most noble son of Atreus, you need not urgeme; from the moment we began to drive them back to Ilius, I have neverceased so far as in me lies to look out for men whom I can shoot andkill; I have shot eight barbed shafts, and all of them have beenburied in the flesh of warlike youths, but this mad dog I cannot hit.""

ííííAs he spoke he aimed another arrow straight at Hector, for he wasbent on hitting him; nevertheless he missed him, and the arrow hitPriam's brave son Gorgythion in the breast. His mother, fairCastianeira, lovely as a goddess, had been married from Aesyme, andnow he bowed his head as a garden poppy in full bloom when it isweighed down by showers in spring- even thus heavy bowed his headbeneath the weight of his helmet.

ííííAgain he aimed at Hector, for he was longing to hit him, and againhis arrow missed, for Apollo turned it aside; but he hit Hector'sbrave charioteer Archeptolemus in the breast, by the nipple, as he wasdriving furiously into the fight. The horses swerved aside as hefell headlong from the chariot, and there was no life left in him.Hector was greatly grieved at the loss of his charioteer, but forall his sorrow he let him lie where he fell, and bade his brotherCebriones, who was hard by, take the reins. Cebriones did as he hadsaid. Hector thereon with a loud cry sprang from his chariot to theground, and seizing a great stone made straight for Teucer with intentkill him. Teucer had just taken an arrow from his quiver and hadlaid it upon the bow-string, but Hector struck him with the jaggedstone as he was taking aim and drawing the string to his shoulder;he hit him just where the collar-bone divides the neck from the chest,a very deadly place, and broke the sinew of his arm so that hiswrist was less, and the bow dropped from his hand as he fell forwardon his knees. Ajax saw that his brother had fallen, and runningtowards him bestrode him and sheltered him with his shield.Meanwhile his two trusty squires, Mecisteus son of Echius, andAlastor, came up and bore him to the ships groaning in his great pain.glad when he saw

ííííJove now again put heart into the Trojans, and they drove theAchaeans to their deep trench with Hector in all his glory at theirhead. As a hound grips a wild boar or lion in flank or buttock when hegives him chase, and watches warily for his wheeling, even so didHector follow close upon the Achaeans, ever killing the hindmost asthey rushed panic-stricken onwards. When they had fled through the setstakes and trench and many Achaeans had been laid low at the handsof the Trojans, they halted at their ships, calling upon one anotherand praying every man instantly as they lifted up their hands to thegods; but Hector wheeled his horses this way and that, his eyesglaring like those of Gorgo or murderous Mars.

ííííJuno when she saw them had pity upon them, and at once said toMinerva, ""Alas, child of aegis-bearing Jove, shall you and I take nomore thought for the dying Danaans, though it be the last time we everdo so? See how they perish and come to a bad end before the onset ofbut a single man. Hector the son of Priam rages with intolerable fury,and has already done great mischief.""

ííííMinerva answered, ""Would, indeed, this fellow might die in his ownland, and fall by the hands of the Achaeans; but my father Jove is madwith spleen, ever foiling me, ever headstrong and unjust. He forgetshow often I saved his son when he was worn out by the laboursEurystheus had laid on him. He would weep till his cry came up toheaven, and then Jove would send me down to help him; if I had had thesense to foresee all this, when Eurystheus sent him to the house ofHades, to fetch the hell-hound from Erebus, he would never have comeback alive out of the deep waters of the river Styx. And now Jovehates me, while he lets Thetis have her way because she kissed hisknees and took hold of his beard, when she was begging him to dohonour to Achilles. I shall know what to do next time he beginscalling me his grey-eyed darling. Get our horses ready, while I gowithin the house of aegis-bearing Jove and put on my armour; weshall then find out whether Priam's son Hector will be glad to meet usin the highways of battle, or whether the Trojans will glut hounds andvultures with the fat of their flesh as they he dead by the ships ofthe Achaeans.""

ííííThus did she speak and white-armed Juno, daughter of great Saturn,obeyed her words; she set about harnessing her gold-bedizenedsteeds, while Minerva daughter of aegis-bearing Jove flung herrichly vesture, made with her own hands, on to the threshold of herfather, and donned the shirt of Jove, arming herself for battle.Then she stepped into her flaming chariot, and grasped the spear sostout and sturdy and strong with which she quells the ranks ofheroes who have displeased her. Juno lashed her horses, and thegates of heaven bellowed as they flew open of their own accord-gates over which the Hours preside, in whose hands are heaven andOlympus, either to open the dense cloud that hides them or to closeit. Through these the goddesses drove their obedient steeds.

ííííBut father Jove when he saw them from Ida was very angry, and sentwinged Iris with a message to them. ""Go,"" said he, ""fleet Iris, turnthem back, and see that they do not come near me, for if we come tofighting there will be mischief. This is what I say, and this iswhat I mean to do. I will lame their horses for them; I will hurl themfrom their chariot, and will break it in pieces. It will take them allten years to heal the wounds my lightning shall inflict upon them;my grey-eyed daughter will then learn what quarrelling with her fathermeans. I am less surprised and angry with Juno, for whatever I say shealways contradicts me.""

ííííWith this Iris went her way, fleet as the wind, from the heightsof Ida to the lofty summits of Olympus. She met the goddesses at theouter gates of its many valleys and gave them her message. ""What,""said she, ""are you about? Are you mad? The son of Saturn forbidsgoing. This is what he says, and this is he means to do, he willlame your horses for you, he will hurl you from your chariot, and willbreak it in pieces. It will take you all ten years to heal thewounds his lightning will inflict upon you, that you may learn,grey-eyed goddess, what quarrelling with your father means. He is lesshurt and angry with Juno, for whatever he says she alwayscontradicts him but you, bold bold hussy, will you really dare toraise your huge spear in defiance of Jove?""

ííííWith this she left them, and Juno said to Minerva, ""Of a truth,child of aegis-bearing Jove, I am not for fighting men's battlesfurther in defiance of Jove. Let them live or die as luck will haveit, and let Jove mete out his judgements upon the Trojans andDanaans according to his own pleasure.""

ííííShe turned her steeds; the Hours presently unyoked them, made themfast to their ambrosial mangers, and leaned the chariot against theend wall of the courtyard. The two goddesses then sat down upontheir golden thrones, amid the company of the other gods; but theywere very angry.

ííííPresently father Jove drove his chariot to Olympus, and enteredthe assembly of gods. The mighty lord of the earthquake unyoked hishorses for him, set the car upon its stand, and threw a cloth over it.Jove then sat down upon his golden throne and Olympus reeled beneathhim. Minerva and Juno sat alone, apart from Jove, and neither spokenor asked him questions, but Jove knew what they meant, and said,""Minerva and Juno, why are you so angry? Are you fatigued with killingso many of your dear friends the Trojans? Be this as it may, such isthe might of my hands that all the gods in Olympus cannot turn me; youwere both of you trembling all over ere ever you saw the fight and itsterrible doings. I tell you therefore-and it would have surely been- Ishould have struck you with lighting, and your chariots would neverhave brought you back again to Olympus.""

ííííMinerva and Juno groaned in spirit as they sat side by side andbrooded mischief for the Trojans. Minerva sat silent without a word,for she was in a furious passion and bitterly incensed against herfather; but Juno could not contain herself and said, ""What, dreadson of Saturn, are you talking about? We know how great your power is,nevertheless we have compassion upon the Danaan warriors who areperishing and coming to a bad end. We will, however, since you sobid us, refrain from actual fighting, but we will make serviceablesuggestions to the Argives, that they may not all of them perish inyour displeasure.""

ííííAnd Jove answered, ""To-morrow morning, Juno, if you choose to do so,you will see the son of Saturn destroying large numbers of theArgives, for fierce Hector shall not cease fighting till he has rousedthe son of Peleus when they are fighting in dire straits at theirships' sterns about the body of Patroclus. Like it or no, this ishow it is decreed; for aught I care, you may go to the lowest depthsbeneath earth and sea, where Iapetus and Saturn dwell in lone Tartaruswith neither ray of light nor breath of wind to cheer them. You may goon and on till you get there, and I shall not care one whit for yourdispleasure; you are the greatest vixen living.""

ííííJuno made him no answer. The sun's glorious orb now sank intoOceanus and drew down night over the land. Sorry indeed were theTrojans when light failed them, but welcome and thrice prayed fordid darkness fall upon the Achaeans.

ííííThen Hector led the Trojans back from the ships, and held acouncil on the open space near the river, where there was a spot earcorpses. They left their chariots and sat down on the ground to hearthe speech he made them. He grasped a spear eleven cubits long, thebronze point of which gleamed in front of it, while the ring round thespear-head was of gold Spear in hand he spoke. ""Hear me,"" said he,""Trojans, Dardanians, and allies. I deemed but now that I shoulddestroy the ships and all the Achaeans with them ere I went back toIlius, but darkness came on too soon. It was this alone that savedthem and their ships upon the seashore. Now, therefore, let us obeythe behests of night, and prepare our suppers. Take your horses out oftheir chariots and give them their feeds of corn; then make speed tobring sheep and cattle from the city; bring wine also and corn foryour horses and gather much wood, that from dark till dawn we may burnwatchfires whose flare may reach to heaven. For the Achaeans may tryto fly beyond the sea by night, and they must not embark scathelessand unmolested; many a man among them must take a dart with him tonurse at home, hit with spear or arrow as he is leaping on board hisship, that others may fear to bring war and weeping upon theTrojans. Moreover let the heralds tell it about the city that thegrowing youths and grey-bearded men are to camp upon itsheaven-built walls. Let the women each of them light a great fire inher house, and let watch be safely kept lest the town be entered bysurprise while the host is outside. See to it, brave Trojans, as Ihave said, and let this suffice for the moment; at daybreak I willinstruct you further. I pray in hope to Jove and to the gods that wemay then drive those fate-sped hounds from our land, for 'tis thefates that have borne them and their ships hither. This night,therefore, let us keep watch, but with early morning let us put on ourarmour and rouse fierce war at the ships of the Achaeans; I shall thenknow whether brave Diomed the son of Tydeus will drive me back fromthe ships to the wall, or whether I shall myself slay him and carryoff his bloodstained spoils. To-morrow let him show his mettle,abide my spear if he dare. I ween that at break of day, he shall beamong the first to fall and many another of his comrades round him.Would that I were as sure of being immortal and never growing old, andof being worshipped like Minerva and Apollo, as I am that this daywill bring evil to the Argives.""

ííííThus spoke Hector and the Trojans shouted applause. They tooktheir sweating steeds from under the yoke, and made them fast eachby his own chariot. They made haste to bring sheep and cattle from thecity, they brought wine also and corn from their houses and gatheredmuch wood. They then offered unblemished hecatombs to the immortals,and the wind carried the sweet savour of sacrifice to heaven- butthe blessed gods partook not thereof, for they bitterly hated Iliuswith Priam and Priam's people. Thus high in hope they sat throughthe livelong night by the highways of war, and many a watchfire didthey kindle. As when the stars shine clear, and the moon is bright-there is not a breath of air, not a peak nor glade nor juttingheadland but it stands out in the ineffable radiance that breaksfrom the serene of heaven; the stars can all of them be told and theheart of the shepherd is glad- even thus shone the watchfires of theTrojans before Ilius midway between the ships and the river Xanthus. Athousand camp-fires gleamed upon the plain, and in the glow of eachthere sat fifty men, while the horses, champing oats and corn besidetheir chariots, waited till dawn should come.

ííííBOOK IX

ííííTHUS did the Trojans watch. But Panic, comrade of blood-stainedRout, had taken fast hold of the Achaeans and their princes were allof them in despair. As when the two winds that blow from Thrace- thenorth and the northwest- spring up of a sudden and rouse the fury ofthe main- in a moment the dark waves uprear their heads and scattertheir sea-wrack in all directions- even thus troubled were thehearts of the Achaeans.

ííííThe son of Atreus in dismay bade the heralds call the people to acouncil man by man, but not to cry the matter aloud; he made hastealso himself to call them, and they sat sorry at heart in theirassembly. Agamemnon shed tears as it were a running stream or cataracton the side of some sheer cliff; and thus, with many a heavy sigh hespoke to the Achaeans. ""My friends,"" said he, ""princes and councillorsOf the Argives, the hand of heaven has been laid heavily upon me.Cruel Jove gave me his solemn promise that I should sack the city ofTroy before returning, but he has played me false, and is nowbidding me go ingloriously back to Argos with the loss of much people.Such is the will of Jove, who has laid many a proud city in the dustas he will yet lay others, for his power is above all. Now, therefore,let us all do as I say and sail back to our own country, for weshall not take Troy.""

ííííThus he spoke, and the sons of the Achaeans for a long while satsorrowful there, but they all held their peace, till at last Diomed ofthe loud battle-cry made answer saying, ""Son of Atreus, I will chideyour folly, as is my right in council. Be not then aggrieved that Ishould do so. In the first place you attacked me before all theDanaans and said that I was a coward and no soldier. The Argives youngand old know that you did so. But the son of scheming Saturn endowedyou by halves only. He gave you honour as the chief ruler over us, butvalour, which is the highest both right and might he did not give you.Sir, think you that the sons of the Achaeans are indeed as unwarlikeand cowardly as you say they are? If your own mind is set upon goinghome- go- the way is open to you; the many ships that followed youfrom Mycene stand ranged upon the seashore; but the rest of us stayhere till we have sacked Troy. Nay though these too should turnhomeward with their ships, Sthenelus and myself will still fight ontill we reach the goal of Ilius, for for heaven was with us when wecame.""

ííííThe sons of the Achaeans shouted applause at the words of Diomed,and presently Nestor rose to speak. ""Son of Tydeus,"" said he, ""inwar your prowess is beyond question, and in council you excel allwho are of your own years; no one of the Achaeans can make light ofwhat you say nor gainsay it, but you have not yet come to the end ofthe whole matter. You are still young- you might be the youngest of myown children- still you have spoken wisely and have counselled thechief of the Achaeans not without discretion; nevertheless I amolder than you and I will tell you every"" thing; therefore let no man,not even King Agamemnon, disregard my saying, for he that fomentscivil discord is a clanless, hearthless outlaw.

íííí""Now, however, let us obey the behests of night and get our suppers,but let the sentinels every man of them camp by the trench that iswithout the wall. I am giving these instructions to the young men;when they have been attended to, do you, son of Atreus, give yourorders, for you are the most royal among us all. Prepare a feast foryour councillors; it is right and reasonable that you should do so;there is abundance of wine in your tents, which the ships of theAchaeans bring from Thrace daily. You have everything at your disposalwherewith to entertain guests, and you have many subjects. When manyare got together, you can be guided by him whose counsel is wisest-and sorely do we need shrewd and prudent counsel, for the foe haslit his watchfires hard by our ships. Who can be other thandismayed? This night will either be the ruin of our host, or save it.""

ííííThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. The sentinelswent out in their armour under command of Nestor's son Thrasymedes,a captain of the host, and of the bold warriors Ascalaphus andIalmenus: there were also Meriones, Aphareus and Deipyrus, and the sonof Creion, noble Lycomedes. There were seven captains of thesentinels, and with each there went a hundred youths armed with longspears: they took their places midway between the trench and the wall,and when they had done so they lit their fires and got every man hissupper.

ííííThe son of Atreus then bade many councillors of the Achaeans tohis quarters prepared a great feast in their honour. They laid theirhands on the good things that were before them, and as soon as theyhad enough to eat and drink, old Nestor, whose counsel was evertruest, was the first to lay his mind before them. He, therefore, withall sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus.

íííí""With yourself, most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon,will I both begin my speech and end it, for you are king over muchpeople. Jove, moreover, has vouchsafed you to wield the sceptre and touphold righteousness, that you may take thought for your peopleunder you; therefore it behooves you above all others both to speakand to give ear, and to out the counsel of another who shall have beenminded to speak wisely. All turns on you and on your commands,therefore I will say what I think will be best. No man will be of atruer mind than that which has been mine from the hour when you,sir, angered Achilles by taking the girl Briseis from his tent againstmy judgment. I urged you not to do so, but you yielded to your ownpride, and dishonoured a hero whom heaven itself had honoured- for youstill hold the prize that had been awarded to him. Now, however, letus think how we may appease him, both with presents and fairspeeches that may conciliate him.""

ííííAnd King Agamemnon answered, ""Sir, you have reproved my follyjustly. I was wrong. I own it. One whom heaven befriends is in himselfa host, and Jove has shown that he befriends this man by destroyingmuch people of the Achaeans. I was blinded with passion and yielded tomy worser mind; therefore I will make amends, and will give himgreat gifts by way of atonement. I will tell them in the presence ofyou all. I will give him seven tripods that have never yet been on thefire, and ten talents of gold. I will give him twenty iron cauldronsand twelve strong horses that have won races and carried off prizes.Rich, indeed, both in land and gold is he that has as many prizes asmy horses have won me. I will give him seven excellent workwomen,Lesbians, whom I chose for myself when he took Lesbos- all ofsurpassing beauty. I will give him these, and with them her whom Ierewhile took from him, the daughter of Briseus; and I swear a greatoath that I never went up into her couch, nor have been with her afterthe manner of men and women.

íííí""All these things will I give him now down, and if hereafter thegods vouchsafe me to sack the city of Priam, let him come when weAchaeans are dividing the spoil, and load his ship with gold andbronze to his liking; furthermore let him take twenty Trojan women,the loveliest after Helen herself. Then, when we reach AchaeanArgos, wealthiest of all lands, he shall be my son-in-law and I willshow him like honour with my own dear son Orestes, who is beingnurtured in all abundance. I have three daughters, Chrysothemis,Laodice, and lphianassa, let him take the one of his choice, freelyand without gifts of wooing, to the house of Peleus; I will add suchdower to boot as no man ever yet gave his daughter, and will givehim seven well established cities, Cardamyle, Enope, and Hire, wherethere is grass; holy Pherae and the rich meadows of Anthea; Aepeaalso, and the vine-clad slopes of Pedasus, all near the sea, and onthe borders of sandy Pylos. The men that dwell there are rich incattle and sheep; they will honour him with gifts as though he werea god, and be obedient to his comfortable ordinances. All this willI do if he will now forgo his anger. Let him then yieldit is onlyHades who is utterly ruthless and unyielding- and hence he is of allgods the one most hateful to mankind. Moreover I am older and moreroyal than himself. Therefore, let him now obey me.""

ííííThen Nestor answered, ""Most noble son of Atreus, king of men,Agamemnon. The gifts you offer are no small ones, let us then sendchosen messengers, who may go to the tent of Achilles son of Peleuswithout delay. Let those go whom I shall name. Let Phoenix, dear toJove, lead the way; let Ajax and Ulysses follow, and let the heraldsOdius and Eurybates go with them. Now bring water for our hands, andbid all keep silence while we pray to Jove the son of Saturn, if so bethat he may have mercy upon us.""

ííííThus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well. Men-servantspoured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled themixing-bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after givingevery man his drink-offering; then, when they had made theirofferings, and had drunk each as much as he was minded, the envoys setout from the tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus; and Nestor, lookingfirst to one and then to another, but most especially at Ulysses,was instant with them that they should prevail with the noble son ofPeleus.

ííííThey went their way by the shore of the sounding sea, and prayedearnestly to earth-encircling Neptune that the high spirit of theson of Aeacus might incline favourably towards them. When they reachedthe ships and tents of the Myrmidons, they found Achilles playing on alyre, fair, of cunning workmanship, and its cross-bar was of silver.It was part of the spoils which he had taken when he sacked the cityof Eetion, and he was now diverting himself with it and singing thefeats of heroes. He was alone with Patroclus, who sat opposite tohim and said nothing, waiting till he should cease singing. Ulyssesand Ajax now came in- Ulysses leading the way -and stood before him.Achilles sprang from his seat with the lyre still in his hand, andPatroclus, when he saw the strangers, rose also. Achilles then greetedthem saying, ""All hail and welcome- you must come upon some greatmatter, you, who for all my anger are still dearest to me of theAchaeans.""

ííííWith this he led them forward, and bade them sit on seats coveredwith purple rugs; then he said to Patroclus who was close by him, ""Sonof Menoetius, set a larger bowl upon the table, mix less water withthe wine, and give every man his cup, for these are very dear friends,who are now under my roof.""

ííííPatroclus did as his comrade bade him; he set the chopping-blockin front of the fire, and on it he laid the loin of a sheep, theloin also of a goat, and the chine of a fat hog. Automedon held themeat while Achilles chopped it; he then sliced the pieces and put themon spits while the son of Menoetius made the fire burn high. Whenthe flame had died down, he spread the embers, laid the spits on topof them, lifting them up and setting them upon the spit-racks; andhe sprinkled them with salt. When the meat was roasted, he set it onplatters, and handed bread round the table in fair baskets, whileAchilles dealt them their portions. Then Achilles took his seat facingUlysses against the opposite wall, and bade his comrade Patroclusoffer sacrifice to the gods; so he cast the offerings into the fire,and they laid their hands upon the good things that were beforethem. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, Ajax made asign to Phoenix, and when he saw this, Ulysses filled his cup withwine and pledged Achilles.

íííí""Hail,"" said he, ""Achilles, we have had no scant of good cheer,neither in the tent of Agamemnon, nor yet here; there has beenplenty to eat and drink, but our thought turns upon no such matter.Sir, we are in the face of great disaster, and without your helpknow not whether we shall save our fleet or lose it. The Trojans andtheir allies have camped hard by our ships and by the wall; theyhave lit watchfires throughout their host and deem that nothing cannow prevent them from falling on our fleet. Jove, moreover, has senthis lightnings on their right; Hector, in all his glory, rages likea maniac; confident that Jove is with him he fears neither god norman, but is gone raving mad, and prays for the approach of day. Hevows that he will hew the high sterns of our ships in pieces, set fireto their hulls, and make havoc of the Achaeans while they are dazedand smothered in smoke; I much fear that heaven will make good hisboasting, and it will prove our lot to perish at Troy far from ourhome in Argos. Up, then, and late though it be, save the sons of theAchaeans who faint before the fury of the Trojans. You will repentbitterly hereafter if you do not, for when the harm is done there willbe no curing it; consider ere it be too late, and save the Danaansfrom destruction.

íííí""My good friend, when your father Peleus sent you from Phthia toAgamemnon, did he not charge you saying, 'Son, Minerva and Juno willmake you strong if they choose, but check your high temper, for thebetter part is in goodwill. Eschew vain quarrelling, and theAchaeans old and young will respect you more for doing so.' These werehis words, but you have forgotten them. Even now, however, beappeased, and put away your anger from you. Agamemnon will make yougreat amends if you will forgive him; listen, and I will tell you whathe has said in his tent that he will give you. He will give youseven tripods that have never yet been on the fire, and ten talents ofgold; twenty iron cauldrons, and twelve strong horses that have wonraces and carried off prizes. Rich indeed both in land and gold ishe who has as many prizes as these horses have won for Agamemnon.Moreover he will give you seven excellent workwomen, Lesbians, whom hechose for himself, when you took Lesbos- all of surpassing beauty.He will give you these, and with them her whom he erewhile took fromyou, the daughter of Briseus, and he will swear a great oath, he hasnever gone up into her couch nor been with her after the manner of menand women. All these things will he give you now down, and ifhereafter the gods vouchsafe him to sack the city of Priam, you cancome when we Achaeans are dividing the spoil, and load your shipwith gold and bronze to your liking. You can take twenty Trojan women,the loveliest after Helen herself. Then, when we reach AchaeanArgos, wealthiest of all lands, you shall be his son-in-law, and hewill show you like honour with his own dear son Orestes, who isbeing nurtured in all abundance. Agamemnon has three daughters,Chrysothemis, Laodice, and Iphianassa; you may take the one of yourchoice, freely and without gifts of wooing, to the house of Peleus; hewill add such dower to boot as no man ever yet gave his daughter,and will give you seven well-established cities, Cardamyle, Enope, andHire where there is grass; holy Pheras and the rich meadows of Anthea;Aepea also, and the vine-clad slopes of Pedasus, all near the sea, andon the borders of sandy Pylos. The men that dwell there are rich incattle and sheep; they will honour you with gifts as though were agod, and be obedient to your comfortable ordinances. All this willhe do if you will now forgo your anger. Moreover, though you hate bothhim and his gifts with all your heart, yet pity the rest of theAchaeans who are being harassed in all their host; they will honouryou as a god, and you will earn great glory at their hands. Youmight even kill Hector; he will come within your reach, for he isinfatuated, and declares that not a Danaan whom the ships have broughtcan hold his own against him.""

ííííAchilles answered, ""Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, I should give youformal notice plainly and in all fixity of purpose that there be nomore of this cajoling, from whatsoever quarter it may come. Him do Ihate even as the gates of hell who says one thing while he hidesanother in his heart; therefore I will say what I mean. I will beappeased neither by Agamemnon son of Atreus nor by any other of theDanaans, for I see that I have no thanks for all my fighting. Hethat fights fares no better than he that does not; coward and hero areheld in equal honour, and death deals like measure to him who worksand him who is idle. I have taken nothing by all my hardships- with mylife ever in my hand; as a bird when she has found a morsel takes itto her nestlings, and herself fares hardly, even so man a long nighthave I been wakeful, and many a bloody battle have I waged by dayagainst those who were fighting for their women. With my ships Ihave taken twelve cities, and eleven round about Troy have I stormedwith my men by land; I took great store of wealth from every one ofthem, but I gave all up to Agamemnon son of Atreus. He stayed where hewas by his ships, yet of what came to him he gave little, and keptmuch himself.

íííí""Nevertheless he did distribute some meeds of honour among thechieftains and kings, and these have them still; from me alone ofthe Achaeans did he take the woman in whom I delighted- let him keepher and sleep with her. Why, pray, must the Argives needs fight theTrojans? What made the son of Atreus gather the host and bring them?Was it not for the sake of Helen? Are the sons of Atreus the onlymen in the world who love their wives? Any man of common right feelingwill love and cherish her who is his own, as I this woman, with mywhole heart, though she was but a fruitling of my spear. Agamemnon hastaken her from me; he has played me false; I know him; let him temptme no further, for he shall not move me. Let him look to you, Ulysses,and to the other princes to save his ships from burning. He has donemuch without me already. He has built a wall; he has dug a trench deepand wide all round it, and he has planted it within with stakes; buteven so he stays not the murderous might of Hector. So long as Ifought the Achaeans Hector suffered not the battle range far fromthe city walls; he would come to the Scaean gates and to the oak tree,but no further. Once he stayed to meet me and hardly did he escapemy onset: now, however, since I am in no mood to fight him, I willto-morrow offer sacrifice to Jove and to all the gods; I will drawmy ships into the water and then victual them duly; to-morrow morning,if you care to look, you will see my ships on the Hellespont, and mymen rowing out to sea with might and main. If great Neptune vouchsafesme a fair passage, in three days I shall be in Phthia. I have muchthere that I left behind me when I came here to my sorrow, and I shallbring back still further store of gold, of red copper, of fairwomen, and of iron, my share of the spoils that we have taken; but oneprize, he who gave has insolently taken away. Tell him all as I nowbid you, and tell him in public that the Achaeans may hate him andbeware of him should he think that he can yet dupe others for hiseffrontery never fails him.

íííí""As for me, hound that he is, he dares not look me in the face. Iwill take no counsel with him, and will undertake nothing in commonwith him. He has wronged me and deceived me enough, he shall not cozenme further; let him go his own way, for Jove has robbed him of hisreason. I loathe his presents, and for himself care not one straw.He may offer me ten or even twenty times what he has now done, nay-not though it be all that he has in the world, both now or evershall have; he may promise me the wealth of Orchomenus or ofEgyptian Thebes, which is the richest city in the whole world, forit has a hundred gates through each of which two hundred men may driveat once with their chariots and horses; he may offer me gifts as thesands of the sea or the dust of the plain in multitude, but even so heshall not move me till I have been revenged in full for the bitterwrong he has done me. I will not marry his daughter; she may be fairas Venus, and skilful as Minerva, but I will have none of her: letanother take her, who may be a good match for her and who rules alarger kingdom. If the gods spare me to return home, Peleus willfind me a wife; there are Achaean women in Hellas and Phthia,daughters of kings that have cities under them; of these I can takewhom I will and marry her. Many a time was I minded when at home inPhthia to woo and wed a woman who would make me a suitable wife, andto enjoy the riches of my old father Peleus. My life is more to methan all the wealth of Ilius while it was yet at peace before theAchaeans went there, or than all the treasure that lies on the stonefloor of Apollo's temple beneath the cliffs of Pytho. Cattle and sheepare to be had for harrying, and a man buy both tripods and horses ifhe wants them, but when his life has once left him it can neither bebought nor harried back again.

íííí""My mother Thetis tells me that there are two ways in which I maymeet my end. If I stay here and fight, I shall not return alive but myname will live for ever: whereas if I go home my name will die, but itwill be long ere death shall take me. To the rest of you, then, I say,'Go home, for you will not take Ilius.' Jove has held his hand overher to protect her, and her people have taken heart. Go, therefore, asin duty bound, and tell the princes of the Achaeans the message that Ihave sent them; tell them to find some other plan for the saving oftheir ships and people, for so long as my displeasure lasts the onethat they have now hit upon may not be. As for Phoenix, let himsleep here that he may sail with me in the morning if he so will.But I will not take him by force.""

ííííThey all held their peace, dismayed at the sternness with which hehad denied them, till presently the old knight Phoenix in his greatfear for the ships of the Achaeans, burst into tears and said,""Noble Achilles, if you are now minded to return, and in thefierceness of your anger will do nothing to save the ships fromburning, how, my son, can I remain here without you? Your fatherPeleus bade me go with you when he sent you as a mere lad fromPhthia to Agamemnon. You knew nothing neither of war nor of the artswhereby men make their mark in council, and he sent me with you totrain you in all excellence of speech and action. Therefore, my son, Iwill not stay here without you- no, not though heaven itself vouchsafeto strip my years from off me, and make me young as I was when I firstleft Hellas the land of fair women. I was then flying the anger offather Amyntor, son of Ormenus, who was furious with me in thematter of his concubine, of whom he was enamoured to the wronging ofhis wife my mother. My mother, therefore, prayed me without ceasing tolie with the woman myself, that so she hate my father, and in thecourse of time I yielded. But my father soon came to know, andcursed me bitterly, calling the dread Erinyes to witness. He prayedthat no son of mine might ever sit upon knees- and the gods, Jove ofthe world below and awful Proserpine, fulfilled his curse. I tookcounsel to kill him, but some god stayed my rashness and bade me thinkon men's evil tongues and how I should be branded as the murderer ofmy father: nevertheless I could not bear to stay in my father'shouse with him so bitter a against me. My cousins and clansmen cameabout me, and pressed me sorely to remain; many a sheep and many an oxdid they slaughter, and many a fat hog did they set down to roastbefore the fire; many a jar, too, did they broach of my father's wine.Nine whole nights did they set a guard over me taking it in turns towatch, and they kept a fire always burning, both in the cloister ofthe outer court and in the inner court at the doors of the roomwherein I lay; but when the darkness of the tenth night came, Ibroke through the closed doors of my room, and climbed the wall of theouter court after passing quickly and unperceived through the men onguard and the women servants. I then fled through Hellas till I cameto fertile Phthia, mother of sheep, and to King Peleus, who made mewelcome and treated me as a father treats an only son who will be heirto all his wealth. He made me rich and set me over much people,establishing me on the borders of Phthia where I was chief rulerover the Dolopians.

íííí""It was I, Achilles, who had the making of you; I loved you with allmy heart: for you would eat neither at home nor when you had goneout elsewhere, till I had first set you upon my knees, cut up thedainty morsel that you were to eat, and held the wine-cup to yourlips. Many a time have you slobbered your wine in baby helplessnessover my shirt; I had infinite trouble with you, but I knew that heavenhad vouchsafed me no offspring of my own, and I made a son of you,Achilles, that in my hour of need you might protect me. Now,therefore, I say battle with your pride and beat it; cherish notyour anger for ever; the might and majesty of heaven are more thanours, but even heaven may be appeased; and if a man has sinned heprays the gods, and reconciles them to himself by his piteous criesand by frankincense, with drink-offerings and the savour of burntsacrifice. For prayers are as daughters to great Jove; halt, wrinkled,with eyes askance, they follow in the footsteps of sin, who, beingfierce and fleet of foot, leaves them far behind him, and ever banefulto mankind outstrips them even to the ends of the world; butnevertheless the prayers come hobbling and healing after. If a man haspity upon these daughters of Jove when they draw near him, they willbless him and hear him too when he is praying; but if he deny them andwill not listen to them, they go to Jove the son of Saturn and praythat he may presently fall into sin- to his ruing bitterlyhereafter. Therefore, Achilles, give these daughters of Jove duereverence, and bow before them as all good men will bow. Were notthe son of Atreus offering you gifts and promising others later- if hewere still furious and implacable- I am not he that would bid youthrow off your anger and help the Achaeans, no matter how greattheir need; but he is giving much now, and more hereafter; he has senthis captains to urge his suit, and has chosen those who of all theArgives are most acceptable to you; make not then their words andtheir coming to be of none effect. Your anger has been righteous sofar. We have heard in song how heroes of old time quarrelled when theywere roused to fury, but still they could be won by gifts, and fairwords could soothe them.

íííí""I have an old story in my mind- a very old one- but you are allfriends and I will tell it. The Curetes and the Aetolians werefighting and killing one another round Calydon- the Aetoliansdefending the city and the Curetes trying to destroy it. For Dianaof the golden throne was angry and did them hurt because Oeneus hadnot offered her his harvest first-fruits. The other gods had allbeen feasted with hecatombs, but to the daughter of great Jove alonehe had made no sacrifice. He had forgotten her, or somehow or other ithad escaped him, and this was a grievous sin. Thereon the archergoddess in her displeasure sent a prodigious creature against him- asavage wild boar with great white tusks that did much harm to hisorchard lands, uprooting apple-trees in full bloom and throwing themto the ground. But Meleager son of Oeneus got huntsmen and hounds frommany cities and killed it- for it was so monstrous that not a few wereneeded, and many a man did it stretch upon his funeral pyre. On thisthe goddess set the Curetes and the Aetolians fighting furiously aboutthe head and skin of the boar.

íííí""So long as Meleager was in the field things went badly with theCuretes, and for all their numbers they could not hold their groundunder the city walls; but in the course of time Meleager was angeredas even a wise man will sometimes be. He was incensed with hismother Althaea, and therefore stayed at home with his wedded wife fairCleopatra, who was daughter of Marpessa daughter of Euenus, and ofIdes the man then living. He it was who took his bow and faced KingApollo himself for fair Marpessa's sake; her father and mother thennamed her Alcyone, because her mother had mourned with the plaintivestrains of the halcyon-bird when Phoebus Apollo had carried her off.Meleager, then, stayed at home with Cleopatra, nursing the anger whichhe felt by reason of his mother's curses. His mother, grieving for thedeath of her brother, prayed the gods, and beat the earth with herhands, calling upon Hades and on awful Proserpine; she went downupon her knees and her bosom was wet with tears as she prayed thatthey would kill her son- and Erinys that walks in darkness and knowsno ruth heard her from Erebus.

íííí""Then was heard the din of battle about the gates of Calydon, andthe dull thump of the battering against their walls. Thereon theelders of the Aetolians besought Meleager; they sent the chiefest oftheir priests, and begged him to come out and help them, promising hima great reward. They bade him choose fifty plough-gates, the mostfertile in the plain of Calydon, the one-half vineyard and the otheropen plough-land. The old warrior Oeneus implored him, standing at thethreshold of his room and beating the doors in supplication. Hissisters and his mother herself besought him sore, but he the morerefused them; those of his comrades who were nearest and dearest tohim also prayed him, but they could not move him till the foe wasbattering at the very doors of his chamber, and the Curetes had scaledthe walls and were setting fire to the city. Then at last hissorrowing wife detailed the horrors that befall those whose city istaken; she reminded him how the men are slain, and the city is givenover to the flames, while the women and children are carried intocaptivity; when he heard all this, his heart was touched, and hedonned his armour to go forth. Thus of his own inward motion hesaved the city of the Aetolians; but they now gave him nothing ofthose rich rewards that they had offered earlier, and though hesaved the city he took nothing by it. Be not then, my son, thusminded; let not heaven lure you into any such course. When the shipsare burning it will be a harder matter to save them. Take the gifts,and go, for the Achaeans will then honour you as a god; whereas if youfight without taking them, you may beat the battle back, but youwill not be held in like honour.""

ííííAnd Achilles answered, ""Phoenix, old friend and father, I have noneed of such honour. I have honour from Jove himself, which will abidewith me at my ships while I have breath in my body, and my limbs arestrong. I say further- and lay my saying to your heart- vex me no morewith this weeping and lamentation, all in the cause of the son ofAtreus. Love him so well, and you may lose the love I bear you. Youought to help me rather in troubling those that trouble me; be king asmuch as I am, and share like honour with myself; the others shall takemy answer; stay here yourself and sleep comfortably in your bed; atdaybreak we will consider whether to remain or go.""

ííííOn this she nodded quietly to Patroclus as a sign that he was toprepare a bed for Phoenix, and that the others should take theirleave. Ajax son of Telamon then said, ""Ulysses, noble son ofLaertes, let us be gone, for I see that our journey is vain. We mustnow take our answer, unwelcome though it be, to the Danaans who arewaiting to receive it. Achilles is savage and remorseless; he iscruel, and cares nothing for the love his comrades lavished upon himmore than on all the others. He is implacable- and yet if a man'sbrother or son has been slain he will accept a fine by way of amendsfrom him that killed him, and the wrong-doer having paid in fullremains in peace among his own people; but as for you, Achilles, thegods have put a wicked unforgiving spirit in your heart, and this, allabout one single girl, whereas we now offer you the seven best wehave, and much else into the bargain. Be then of a more gracious mind,respect the hospitality of your own roof. We are with you asmessengers from the host of the Danaans, and would fain he heldnearest and dearest to yourself of all the Achaeans.""

íííí""Ajax,"" replied Achilles, ""noble son of Telamon, you have spokenmuch to my liking, but my blood boils when I think it all over, andremember how the son of Atreus treated me with contumely as though Iwere some vile tramp, and that too in the presence of the Argives. Go,then, and deliver your message; say that I will have no concern withfighting till Hector, son of noble Priam, reaches the tents of theMyrmidons in his murderous course, and flings fire upon their ships.For all his lust of battle, I take it he will be held in check when heis at my own tent and ship.""

ííííOn this they took every man his double cup, made theirdrink-offerings, and went back to the ships, Ulysses leading theway. But Patroclus told his men and the maid-servants to make readya comfortable bed for Phoenix; they therefore did so withsheepskins, a rug, and a sheet of fine linen. The old man then laidhimself down and waited till morning came. But Achilles slept in aninner room, and beside him the daughter of Phorbas lovely Diomede,whom he had carried off from Lesbos. Patroclus lay on the other sideof the room, and with him fair Iphis whom Achilles had given himwhen he took Scyros the city of Enyeus.

ííííWhen the envoys reached the tents of the son of Atreus, the Achaeansrose, pledged them in cups of gold, and began to question them. KingAgamemnon was the first to do so. Tell me, Ulysses,"" said he, ""will hesave the ships from burning, or did be refuse, and is he stillfurious?""

ííííUlysses answered, ""Most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon,Achilles will not be calmed, but is more fiercely angry than ever, andspurns both you and your gifts. He bids you take counsel with theAchaeans to save the ships and host as you best may; as for himself,he said that at daybreak he should draw his ships into the water. Hesaid further that he should advise every one to sail home likewise,for that you will not reach the goal of Ilius. 'Jove,' he said, 'haslaid his hand over the city to protect it, and the people have takenheart.' This is what he said, and the others who were with me can tellyou the same story- Ajax and the two heralds, men, both of them, whomay be trusted. The old man Phoenix stayed where he was to sleep,for so Achilles would have it, that he might go home with him in themorning if he so would; but he will not take him by force.""

ííííThey all held their peace, sitting for a long time silent anddejected, by reason of the sternness with which Achilles had refusedthem, till presently Diomed said, ""Most noble son of Atreus, king ofmen, Agamemnon, you ought not to have sued the son of Peleus noroffered him gifts. He is proud enough as it is, and you haveencouraged him in his pride am further. Let him stay or go as he will.He will fight later when he is in the humour, and heaven puts it inhis mind to do so. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say; we haveeaten and drunk our fill, let us then take our rest, for in rest thereis both strength and stay. But when fair rosy-fingered morn appears,forthwith bring out your host and your horsemen in front of the ships,urging them on, and yourself fighting among the foremost.""

ííííThus he spoke, and the other chieftains approved his words. Theythen made their drink-offerings and went every man to his own tent,where they laid down to rest and enjoyed the boon of sleep.

ííííBOOK X

ííííNOW the other princes of the Achaeans slept soundly the wholenight through, but Agamemnon son of Atreus was troubled, so that hecould get no rest. As when fair Juno's lord flashes his lightning intoken of great rain or hail or snow when the snow-flakes whiten theground, or again as a sign that he will open the wide jaws of hungrywar, even so did Agamemnon heave many a heavy sigh, for his soultrembled within him. When he looked upon the plain of Troy hemarvelled at the many watchfires burning in front of Ilius, and at thesound of pipes and flutes and of the hum of men, but when presently heturned towards the ships and hosts of the Achaeans, he tore his hairby handfuls before Jove on high, and groaned aloud for the verydisquietness of his soul. In the end he deemed it best to go at onceto Nestor son of Neleus, and see if between them they could find anyway of the Achaeans from destruction. He therefore rose, put on hisshirt, bound his sandals about his comely feet, flung the skin of ahuge tawny lion over his shoulders- a skin that reached his feet-and took his spear in his hand.

ííííNeither could Menelaus sleep, for he, too, boded ill for the Argiveswho for his sake had sailed from far over the seas to fight theTrojans. He covered his broad back with the skin of a spotted panther,put a casque of bronze upon his head, and took his spear in his brawnyhand. Then he went to rouse his brother, who was by far the mostpowerful of the Achaeans, and was honoured by the people as thoughhe were a god. He found him by the stern of his ship already puttinghis goodly array about his shoulders, and right glad was he that hisbrother had come.

ííííMenelaus spoke first. ""Why,"" said he, ""my dear brother, are you thusarming? Are you going to send any of our comrades to exploit theTrojans? I greatly fear that no one will do you this service, andspy upon the enemy alone in the dead of night. It will be a deed ofgreat daring.""

ííííAnd King Agamemnon answered, ""Menelaus, we both of us need shrewdcounsel to save the Argives and our ships, for Jove has changed hismind, and inclines towards Hector's sacrifices rather than ours. Inever saw nor heard tell of any man as having wrought such ruin in oneday as Hector has now wrought against the sons of the Achaeans- andthat too of his own unaided self, for he is son neither to god norgoddess. The Argives will rue it long and deeply. Run, therefore, withall speed by the line of the ships, and call Ajax and Idomeneus.Meanwhile I will go to Nestor, and bid him rise and go about among thecompanies of our sentinels to give them their instructions; theywill listen to him sooner than to any man, for his own son, andMeriones brother in arms to Idomeneus, are captains over them. Itwas to them more particularly that we gave this charge.""

ííííMenelaus replied, ""How do I take your meaning? Am I to stay withthem and wait your coming, or shall I return here as soon as I havegiven your orders?"" ""Wait,"" answered King Agamemnon, ""for there are somany paths about the camp that we might miss one another. Call everyman on your way, and bid him be stirring; name him by his lineageand by his father's name, give each all titular observance, andstand not too much upon your own dignity; we must take our fullshare of toil, for at our birth Jove laid this heavy burden upon us.""

ííííWith these instructions he sent his brother on his way, and wenton to Nestor shepherd of his people. He found him sleeping in his tenthard by his own ship; his goodly armour lay beside him- his shield,his two spears and his helmet; beside him also lay the gleaming girdlewith which the old man girded himself when he armed to lead his peopleinto battle- for his age stayed him not. He raised himself on hiselbow and looked up at Agamemnon. ""Who is it,"" said he, ""that goesthus about the host and the ships alone and in the dead of night, whenmen are sleeping? Are you looking for one of your mules or for somecomrade? Do not stand there and say nothing, but speak. What is yourbusiness?""

ííííAnd Agamemnon answered, ""Nestor, son of Neleus, honour to theAchaean name, it is I, Agamemnon son of Atreus, on whom Jove haslaid labour and sorrow so long as there is breath in my body and mylimbs carry me. I am thus abroad because sleep sits not upon myeyelids, but my heart is big with war and with the jeopardy of theAchaeans. I am in great fear for the Danaans. I am at sea, and withoutsure counsel; my heart beats as though it would leap out of my body,and my limbs fail me. If then you can do anything- for you toocannot sleep- let us go the round of the watch, and see whether theyare drowsy with toil and sleeping to the neglect of their duty. Theenemy is encamped hard and we know not but he may attack us by night.""

ííííNestor replied, ""Most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon,Jove will not do all for Hector that Hector thinks he will; he willhave troubles yet in plenty if Achilles will lay aside his anger. Iwill go with you, and we will rouse others, either the son ofTydeus, or Ulysses, or fleet Ajax and the valiant son of Phyleus. Someone had also better go and call Ajax and King Idomeneus, for theirships are not near at hand but the farthest of all. I cannot howeverrefrain from blaming Menelaus, much as I love him and respect him- andI will say so plainly, even at the risk of offending you- for sleepingand leaving all this trouble to yourself. He ought to be going aboutimploring aid from all the princes of the Achaeans, for we are inextreme danger.""

ííííAnd Agamemnon answered, ""Sir, you may sometimes blame him justly,for he is often remiss and unwilling to exert himself- not indeed fromsloth, nor yet heedlessness, but because he looks to me and expects meto take the lead. On this occasion, however, he was awake before Iwas, and came to me of his own accord. I have already sent him to callthe very men whom you have named. And now let us be going. We shallfind them with the watch outside the gates, for it was there I saidthat we would meet them.""

íííí""In that case,"" answered Nestor, ""the Argives will not blame him nordisobey his orders when he urges them to fight or gives theminstructions.""

ííííWith this he put on his shirt, and bound his sandals about hiscomely feet. He buckled on his purple coat, of two thicknesses, large,and of a rough shaggy texture, grasped his redoubtable bronze-shodspear, and wended his way along the line of the Achaean ships. Firsthe called loudly to Ulysses peer of gods in counsel and woke him,for he was soon roused by the sound of the battle-cry. He came outsidehis tent and said, ""Why do you go thus alone about the host, and alongthe line of the ships in the stillness of the night? What is it thatyou find so urgent?"" And Nestor knight of Gerene answered, ""Ulysses,noble son of Laertes, take it not amiss, for the Achaeans are in greatstraits. Come with me and let us wake some other, who may advisewell with us whether we shall fight or fly.""

ííííOn this Ulysses went at once into his tent, put his shield about hisshoulders and came out with them. First they went to Diomed son ofTydeus, and found him outside his tent clad in his armour with hiscomrades sleeping round him and using their shields as pillows; as fortheir spears, they stood upright on the spikes of their butts thatwere driven into the ground, and the burnished bronze flashed afarlike the lightning of father Jove. The hero was sleeping upon the skinof an ox, with a piece of fine carpet under his head; Nestor went upto him and stirred him with his heel to rouse him, upbraiding himand urging him to bestir himself. ""Wake up,"" he exclaimed, ""son ofTydeus. How can you sleep on in this way? Can you not see that theTrojans are encamped on the brow of the plain hard by our ships,with but a little space between us and them?""

ííííOn these words Diomed leaped up instantly and said, ""Old man, yourheart is of iron; you rest not one moment from your labours. Are thereno younger men among the Achaeans who could go about to rouse theprinces? There is no tiring you.""

ííííAnd Nestor knight of Gerene made answer, ""My son, all that youhave said is true. I have good sons, and also much people who mightcall the chieftains, but the Achaeans are in the gravest danger;life and death are balanced as it were on the edge of a razor. Gothen, for you are younger than I, and of your courtesy rouse Ajaxand the fleet son of Phyleus.""

ííííDiomed threw the skin of a great tawny lion about his shoulders- askin that reached his feet- and grasped his spear. When he hadroused the heroes, he brought them back with him; they then went theround of those who were on guard, and found the captains notsleeping at their posts but wakeful and sitting with their armsabout them. As sheep dogs that watch their flocks when they areyarded, and hear a wild beast coming through the mountain foresttowards them- forthwith there is a hue and cry of dogs and men, andslumber is broken- even so was sleep chased from the eyes of theAchaeans as they kept the watches of the wicked night, for they turnedconstantly towards the plain whenever they heard any stir among theTrojans. The old man was glad bade them be of good cheer. ""Watch on,my children,"" said he, ""and let not sleep get hold upon you, lestour enemies triumph over us.""

ííííWith this he passed the trench, and with him the other chiefs of theAchaeans who had been called to the council. Meriones and the braveson of Nestor went also, for the princes bade them. When they werebeyond the trench that was dug round the wall they held theirmeeting on the open ground where there was a space clear of corpses,for it was here that when night fell Hector had turned back from hisonslaught on the Argives. They sat down, therefore, and held debatewith one another.

ííííNestor spoke first. ""My friends,"" said he, ""is there any man boldenough to venture the Trojans, and cut off some straggler, or usnews of what the enemy mean to do whether they will stay here by theships away from the city, or whether, now that they have worsted theAchaeans, they will retire within their walls. If he could learn allthis and come back safely here, his fame would be high as heaven inthe mouths of all men, and he would be rewarded richly; for the chiefsfrom all our ships would each of them give him a black ewe with herlamb- which is a present of surpassing value- and he would be asked asa guest to all feasts and clan-gatherings.""

ííííThey all held their peace, but Diomed of the loud war-cry spokesaying, ""Nestor, gladly will I visit the host of the Trojans overagainst us, but if another will go with me I shall do so in greaterconfidence and comfort. When two men are together, one of them may seesome opportunity which the other has not caught sight of; if a manis alone he is less full of resource, and his wit is weaker.""

ííííOn this several offered to go with Diomed. The two Ajaxes,servants of Mars, Meriones, and the son of Nestor all wanted to go, sodid Menelaus son of Atreus; Ulysses also wished to go among the hostof the Trojans, for he was ever full of daring, and thereonAgamemnon king of men spoke thus: ""Diomed,"" said he, ""son of Tydeus,man after my own heart, choose your comrade for yourself- take thebest man of those that have offered, for many would now go with you.Do not through delicacy reject the better man, and take the worstout of respect for his lineage, because he is of more royal blood.""

ííííHe said this because he feared for Menelaus. Diomed answered, ""Ifyou bid me take the man of my own choice, how in that case can Ifail to think of Ulysses, than whom there is no man more eager to faceall kinds of danger- and Pallas Minerva loves him well? If he wereto go with me we should pass safely through fire itself, for he isquick to see and understand.""

íííí""Son of Tydeus,"" replied Ulysses, ""say neither good nor ill aboutme, for you are among Argives who know me well. Let us be going, forthe night wanes and dawn is at hand. The stars have gone forward,two-thirds of the night are already spent, and the third is alone leftus.""

ííííThey then put on their armour. Brave Thrasymedes provided the son ofTydeus with a sword and a shield (for he had left his own at his ship)and on his head he set a helmet of bull's hide without either peakor crest; it is called a skull-cap and is a common headgear.Meriones found a bow and quiver for Ulysses, and on his head he seta leathern helmet that was lined with a strong plaiting of leathernthongs, while on the outside it was thickly studded with boar's teeth,well and skilfully set into it; next the head there was an innerlining of felt. This helmet had been stolen by Autolycus out ofEleon when he broke into the house of Amyntor son of Ormenus. Hegave it to Amphidamas of Cythera to take to Scandea, and Amphidamasgave it as a guest-gift to Molus, who gave it to his son Meriones; andnow it was set upon the head of Ulysses.

ííííWhen the pair had armed, they set out, and left the other chieftainsbehind them. Pallas Minerva sent them a heron by the wayside upontheir right hands; they could not see it for the darkness, but theyheard its cry. Ulysses was glad when he heard it and prayed toMinerva: ""Hear me,"" he cried, ""daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, you whospy out all my ways and who are with me in all my hardships;befriend me in this mine hour, and grant that we may return to theships covered with glory after having achieved some mighty exploitthat shall bring sorrow to the Trojans.""

ííííThen Diomed of the loud war-cry also prayed: ""Hear me too,"" said he,""daughter of Jove, unweariable; be with me even as you were with mynoble father Tydeus when he went to Thebes as envoy sent by theAchaeans. He left the Achaeans by the banks of the river Aesopus,and went to the city bearing a message of peace to the Cadmeians; onhis return thence, with your help, goddess, he did great deeds ofdaring, for you were his ready helper. Even so guide me and guard menow, and in return I will offer you in sacrifice a broad-browed heiferof a year old, unbroken, and never yet brought by man under theyoke. I will gild her horns and will offer her up to you insacrifice.""

ííííThus they prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard their prayer. When theyhad done praying to the daughter of great Jove, they went their waylike two lions prowling by night amid the armour and blood-stainedbodies of them that had fallen.

ííííNeither again did Hector let the Trojans sleep; for he too calledthe princes and councillors of the Trojans that he might set hiscounsel before them. ""Is there one,"" said he, ""who for a greatreward will do me the service of which I will tell you? He shall bewell paid if he will. I will give him a chariot and a couple ofhorses, the fleetest that can be found at the ships of the Achaeans,if he will dare this thing; and he will win infinite honour to boot;he must go to the ships and find out whether they are still guarded asheretofore, or whether now that we have beaten them the Achaeansdesign to fly, and through sheer exhaustion are neglecting to keeptheir watches.""

ííííThey all held their peace; but there was among the Trojans a certainman named Dolon, son of Eumedes, the famous herald- a man rich in goldand bronze. He was ill-favoured, but a good runner, and was an onlyson among five sisters. He it was that now addressed the Trojans.""I, Hector,"" said he, ""Will to the ships and will exploit them. Butfirst hold up your sceptre and swear that you will give me thechariot, bedight with bronze, and the horses that now carry thenoble son of Peleus. I will make you a good scout, and will not failyou. I will go through the host from one end to the other till Icome to the ship of Agamemnon, where I take it the princes of theAchaeans are now consulting whether they shall fight or fly.""

ííííWhen he had done speaking Hector held up his sceptre, and sworehim his oath saying, ""May Jove the thundering husband of Juno bearwitness that no other Trojan but yourself shall mount those steeds,and that you shall have your will with them for ever.""

ííííThe oath he swore was bootless, but it made Dolon more keen ongoing. He hung his bow over his shoulder, and as an overall he worethe skin of a grey wolf, while on his head he set a cap of ferretskin. Then he took a pointed javelin, and left the camp for the ships,but he was not to return with any news for Hector. When he had leftthe horses and the troops behind him, he made all speed on his way,but Ulysses perceived his coming and said to Diomed, ""Diomed, hereis some one from the camp; I am not sure whether he is a spy, orwhether it is some thief who would plunder the bodies of the dead; lethim get a little past us, we can then spring upon him and take him.If, however, he is too quick for us, go after him with your spearand hem him in towards the ships away from the Trojan camp, to preventhis getting back to the town.""

ííííWith this they turned out of their way and lay down among thecorpses. Dolon suspected nothing and soon passed them, but when he hadgot about as far as the distance by which a mule-plowed furrow exceedsone that has been ploughed by oxen (for mules can plow fallow landquicker than oxen) they ran after him, and when he heard theirfootsteps he stood still, for he made sure they were friends fromthe Trojan camp come by Hector's orders to bid him return; when,however, they were only a spear's cast, or less away form him, hesaw that they were enemies as fast as his legs could take him. Theothers gave chase at once, and as a couple of well-trained houndspress forward after a doe or hare that runs screaming in front ofthem, even so did the son of Tydeus and Ulysses pursue Dolon and cuthim off from his own people. But when he had fled so far towards theships that he would soon have fallen in with the outposts, Minervainfused fresh strength into the son of Tydeus for fear some other ofthe Achaeans might have the glory of being first to hit him, and hemight himself be only second; he therefore sprang forward with hisspear and said, ""Stand, or I shall throw my spear, and in that caseI shall soon make an end of you.""

ííííHe threw as he spoke, but missed his aim on purpose. The dart flewover the man's right shoulder, and then stuck in the ground. Hestood stock still, trembling and in great fear; his teeth chattered,and he turned pale with fear. The two came breathless up to him andseized his hands, whereon he began to weep and said, ""Take me alive; Iwill ransom myself; we have great store of gold, bronze, and wroughtiron, and from this my father will satisfy you with a very largeransom, should he hear of my being alive at the ships of theAchaeans.""

íííí""Fear not,"" replied Ulysses, ""let no thought of death be in yourmind; but tell me, and tell me true, why are you thus going aboutalone in the dead of night away from your camp and towards theships, while other men are sleeping? Is it to plunder the bodies ofthe slain, or did Hector send you to spy out what was going on atthe ships? Or did you come here of your own mere notion?""

ííííDolon answered, his limbs trembling beneath him: ""Hector, with hisvain flattering promises, lured me from my better judgement. He saidhe would give me the horses of the noble son of Peleus and hisbronze-bedizened chariot; he bade me go through the darkness of theflying night, get close to the enemy, and find out whether the shipsare still guarded as heretofore, or whether, now that we have beatenthem, the Achaeans design to fly, and through sheer exhaustion areneglecting to keep their watches.""

ííííUlysses smiled at him and answered, ""You had indeed set your heartupon a great reward, but the horses of the descendant of Aeacus arehardly to be kept in hand or driven by any other mortal man thanAchilles himself, whose mother was an immortal. But tell me, andtell me true, where did you leave Hector when you started? Wherelies his armour and his horses? How, too, are the watches andsleeping-ground of the Trojans ordered? What are their plans? Willthey stay here by the ships and away from the city, or now that theyhave worsted the Achaeans, will they retire within their walls?""

ííííAnd Dolon answered, ""I will tell you truly all. Hector and the othercouncillors are now holding conference by the monument of greatIlus, away from the general tumult; as for the guards about whichyou ask me, there is no chosen watch to keep guard over the host.The Trojans have their watchfires, for they are bound to have them;they, therefore, are awake and keep each other to their duty assentinels; but the allies who have come from other places are asleepand leave it to the Trojans to keep guard, for their wives andchildren are not here.""

ííííUlysses then said, ""Now tell me; are they sleeping among theTrojan troops, or do they lie apart? Explain this that I mayunderstand it.""

íííí""I will tell you truly all,"" replied Dolon. ""To the seaward liethe Carians, the Paeonian bowmen, the Leleges, the Cauconians, and thenoble Pelasgi. The Lysians and proud Mysians, with the Phrygians andMeonians, have their place on the side towards Thymbra; but why askabout an this? If you want to find your way into the host of theTrojans, there are the Thracians, who have lately come here and lieapart from the others at the far end of the camp; and they have Rhesusson of Eioneus for their king. His horses are the finest and strongestthat I have ever seen, they are whiter than snow and fleeter thanany wind that blows. His chariot is bedight with silver and gold,and he has brought his marvellous golden armour, of the rarestworkmanship- too splendid for any mortal man to carry, and meet onlyfor the gods. Now, therefore, take me to the ships or bind me securelyhere, until you come back and have proved my words whether they befalse or true.""

ííííDiomed looked sternly at him and answered, ""Think not, Dolon, forall the good information you have given us, that you shall escapenow you are in our hands, for if we ransom you or let you go, you willcome some second time to the ships of the Achaeans either as a spyor as an open enemy, but if I kill you and an end of you, you willgive no more trouble.""

ííííOn this Dolon would have caught him by the beard to beseech himfurther, but Diomed struck him in the middle of his neck with hissword and cut through both sinews so that his head fell rolling in thedust while he was yet speaking. They took the ferret-skin cap from hishead, and also the wolf-skin, the bow, and his long spear. Ulysseshung them up aloft in honour of Minerva the goddess of plunder, andprayed saying, ""Accept these, goddess, for we give them to you inpreference to all the gods in Olympus: therefore speed us stillfurther towards the horses and sleeping-ground of the Thracians.""

ííííWith these words he took the spoils and set them upon a tamarisktree, and they marked the place by pulling up reeds and gatheringboughs of tamarisk that they might not miss it as they came backthrough the' flying hours of darkness. The two then went onwardsamid the fallen armour and the blood, and came presently to thecompany of Thracian soldiers, who were sleeping, tired out withtheir day's toil; their goodly armour was lying on the ground besidethem all orderly in three rows, and each man had his yoke of horsesbeside him. Rhesus was sleeping in the middle, and hard by him hishorses were made fast to the topmost rim of his chariot. Ulyssesfrom some way off saw him and said, ""This, Diomed, is the man, andthese are the horses about which Dolon whom we killed told us. Do yourvery utmost; dally not about your armour, but loose the horses atonce- or else kill the men yourself, while I see to the horses.""

ííííThereon Minerva put courage into the heart of Diomed, and he smotethem right and left. They made a hideous groaning as they were beinghacked about, and the earth was red with their blood. As a lionsprings furiously upon a flock of sheep or goats when he finds withouttheir shepherd, so did the son of Tydeus set upon the Thraciansoldiers till he had killed twelve. As he killed them Ulysses came anddrew them aside by their feet one by one, that the horses might goforward freely without being frightened as they passed over the deadbodies, for they were not yet used to them. When the son of Tydeuscame to the king, he killed him too (which made thirteen), as he wasbreathing hard, for by the counsel of Minerva an evil dream, theseed of Oeneus, hovered that night over his head. Meanwhile Ulyssesuntied the horses, made them fast one to another and drove them off,striking them with his bow, for he had forgotten to take the whip fromthe chariot. Then he whistled as a sign to Diomed.

ííííBut Diomed stayed where he was, thinking what other daring deed hemight accomplish. He was doubting whether to take the chariot in whichthe king's armour was lying, and draw it out by the pole, or to liftthe armour out and carry it off; or whether again, he should notkill some more Thracians. While he was thus hesitating Minerva came upto him and said, ""Get back, Diomed, to the ships or you may bedriven thither, should some other god rouse the Trojans.""

ííííDiomed knew that it was the goddess, and at once sprang upon thehorses. Ulysses beat them with his bow and they flew onward to theships of the Achaeans.

ííííBut Apollo kept no blind look-out when he saw Minerva with the sonof Tydeus. He was angry with her, and coming to the host of theTrojans he roused Hippocoon, a counsellor of the Thracians and a noblekinsman of Rhesus. He started up out of his sleep and saw that thehorses were no longer in their place, and that the men were gasping intheir death-agony; on this he groaned aloud, and called upon hisfriend by name. Then the whole Trojan camp was in an uproar as thepeople kept hurrying together, and they marvelled at the deeds ofthe heroes who had now got away towards the ships.

ííííWhen they reached the place where they had killed Hector's scout,Ulysses stayed his horses, and the son of Tydeus, leaping to theground, placed the blood-stained spoils in the hands of Ulysses andremounted: then he lashed the horses onwards, and they flew forwardnothing loth towards the ships as though of their own free will.Nestor was first to hear the tramp of their feet. ""My friends,"" saidhe, ""princes and counsellors of the Argives, shall I guess right orwrong?- but I must say what I think: there is a sound in my ears as ofthe tramp of horses. I hope it may Diomed and Ulysses driving inhorses from the Trojans, but I much fear that the bravest of theArgives may have come to some harm at their hands.""

ííííHe had hardly done speaking when the two men came in and dismounted,whereon the others shook hands right gladly with them andcongratulated them. Nestor knight of Gerene was first to questionthem. ""Tell me,"" said he, ""renowned Ulysses, how did you two come bythese horses? Did you steal in among the Trojan forces, or did somegod meet you and give them to you? They are like sunbeams. I am wellconversant with the Trojans, for old warrior though I am I neverhold back by the ships, but I never yet saw or heard of such horses asthese are. Surely some god must have met you and given them to you,for you are both of dear to Jove, and to Jove's daughter Minerva.""

ííííAnd Ulysses answered, ""Nestor son of Neleus, honour to the Achaeanname, heaven, if it so will, can give us even better horses thanthese, for the gods are far mightier than we are. These horses,however, about which you ask me, are freshly come from Thrace.Diomed killed their king with the twelve bravest of his companions.Hard by the ships we took a thirteenth man- a scout whom Hector andthe other Trojans had sent as a spy upon our ships.""

ííííHe laughed as he spoke and drove the horses over the ditch, whilethe other Achaeans followed him gladly. When they reached the stronglybuilt quarters of the son of Tydeus, they tied the horses withthongs of leather to the manger, where the steeds of Diomed stoodeating their sweet corn, but Ulysses hung the blood-stained spoilsof Dolon at the stern of his ship, that they might prepare a sacredoffering to Minerva. As for themselves, they went into the sea andwashed the sweat from their bodies, and from their necks and thighs.When the sea-water had taken all the sweat from off them, and hadrefreshed them, they went into the baths and washed themselves.After they had so done and had anointed themselves with oil, theysat down to table, and drawing from a full mixing-bowl, made adrink-offering of wine to Minerva.

ííííBOOK XI

ííííAND now as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus, harbinger oflight alike to mortals and immortals, Jove sent fierce Discord withthe ensign of war in her hands to the ships of the Achaeans. Shetook her stand by the huge black hull of Ulysses' ship which wasmiddlemost of all, so that her voice might carry farthest on eitherside, on the one hand towards the tents of Ajax son of Telamon, and onthe other towards those of Achilles- for these two heroes,well-assured of their own strength, had valorously drawn up theirships at the two ends of the line. There she took her stand, andraised a cry both loud and shrill that filled the Achaeans withcourage, giving them heart to fight resolutely and with all theirmight, so that they had rather stay there and do battle than go homein their ships.

ííííThe son of Atreus shouted aloud and bade the Argives gird themselvesfor battle while he put on his armour. First he girded his goodlygreaves about his legs, making them fast with ankle clasps ofsilver; and about his chest he set the breastplate which Cinyras hadonce given him as a guest-gift. It had been noised abroad as far asCyprus that the Achaeans were about to sail for Troy, and therefore hegave it to the king. It had ten courses of dark cyanus, twelve ofgold, and ten of tin. There were serpents of cyanus that rearedthemselves up towards the neck, three upon either side, like therainbows which the son of Saturn has set in heaven as a sign to mortalmen. About his shoulders he threw his sword, studded with bosses ofgold; and the scabbard was of silver with a chain of gold wherewith tohang it. He took moreover the richly-dight shield that covered hisbody when he was in battle- fair to see, with ten circles of bronzerunning all round see, wit it. On the body of the shield there weretwenty bosses of white tin, with another of dark cyanus in the middle:this last was made to show a Gorgon's head, fierce and grim, with Routand Panic on either side. The band for the arm to go through was ofsilver, on which there was a writhing snake of cyanus with three headsthat sprang from a single neck, and went in and out among one another.On his head Agamemnon set a helmet, with a peak before and behind, andfour plumes of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it; then hegrasped two redoubtable bronze-shod spears, and the gleam of hisarmour shot from him as a flame into the firmament, while Juno andMinerva thundered in honour of the king of rich Mycene.

ííííEvery man now left his horses in charge of his charioteer to holdthem in readiness by the trench, while he went into battle on footclad in full armour, and a mighty uproar rose on high into thedawning. The chiefs were armed and at the trench before the horses gotthere, but these came up presently. The son of Saturn sent a portentof evil sound about their host, and the dew fell red with blood, forhe was about to send many a brave man hurrying down to Hades.

ííííThe Trojans, on the other side upon the rising slope of the plain,were gathered round great Hector, noble Polydamas, Aeneas who washonoured by the Trojans like an immortal, and the three sons ofAntenor, Polybus, Agenor, and young Acamas beauteous as a god.Hector's round shield showed in the front rank, and as some banefulstar that shines for a moment through a rent in the clouds and isagain hidden beneath them; even so was Hector now seen in the frontranks and now again in the hindermost, and his bronze armour gleamedlike the lightning of aegis-bearing Jove.

ííííAnd now as a band of reapers mow swathes of wheat or barley upon arich man's land, and the sheaves fall thick before them, even so didthe Trojans and Achaeans fall upon one another; they were in no moodfor yielding but fought like wolves, and neither side got the betterof the other. Discord was glad as she beheld them, for she was theonly god that went among them; the others were not there, but stayedquietly each in his own home among the dells and valleys of Olympus.All of them blamed the son of Saturn for wanting to Live victory tothe Trojans, but father Jove heeded them not: he held aloof fromall, and sat apart in his all-glorious majesty, looking down uponthe city of the Trojans, the ships of the Achaeans, the gleam ofbronze, and alike upon the slayers and on the slain.

ííííNow so long as the day waxed and it was still morning, their dartsrained thick on one another and the people perished, but as the hourdrew nigh when a woodman working in some mountain forest will gethis midday meal- for he has felled till his hands are weary; he istired out, and must now have food- then the Danaans with a cry thatrang through all their ranks, broke the battalions of the enemy.Agamemnon led them on, and slew first Bienor, a leader of hispeople, and afterwards his comrade and charioteer Oileus, who sprangfrom his chariot and was coming full towards him; but Agamemnon struckhim on the forehead with his spear; his bronze visor was of no availagainst the weapon, which pierced both bronze and bone, so that hisbrains were battered in and he was killed in full fight.

ííííAgamemnon stripped their shirts from off them and left them withtheir breasts all bare to lie where they had fallen. He then went onto kill Isus and Antiphus two sons of Priam, the one a bastard, theother born in wedlock; they were in the same chariot- the bastarddriving, while noble Antiphus fought beside him. Achilles had oncetaken both of them prisoners in the glades of Ida, and had boundthem with fresh withes as they were shepherding, but he had taken aransom for them; now, however, Agamemnon son of Atreus smote Isus inthe chest above the nipple with his spear, while he struck Antiphushard by the ear and threw him from his chariot. Forthwith hestripped their goodly armour from off them and recognized them, for hehad already seen them at ships when Achilles brought them in from Ida.As a lion fastens on the fawns of a hind and crushes them in his greatjaws, robbing them of their tender life while he on his way back tohis lair- the hind can do nothing for them even though she be closeby, for she is in an agony of fear, and flies through the thickforest, sweating, and at her utmost speed before the mighty monster-so, no man of the Trojans could help Isus and Antiphus, for theywere themselves flying panic before the Argives.

ííííThen King Agamemnon took the two sons of Antimachus, Pisander andbrave Hippolochus. It was Antimachus who had been foremost inpreventing Helen's being restored to Menelaus, for he was largelybribed by Alexandrus; and now Agamemnon took his two sons, both in thesame chariot, trying to bring their horses to a stand- for they hadlost hold of the reins and the horses were mad with fear. The son ofAtreus sprang upon them like a lion, and the pair besought him fromtheir chariot. ""Take us alive,"" they cried, ""son of Atreus, and youshall receive a great ransom for us. Our father Antimachus has greatstore of gold, bronze, and wrought iron, and from this he will satisfyyou with a very large ransom should he hear of our being alive atthe ships of the Achaeans.""

ííííWith such piteous words and tears did they beseech the king, butthey heard no pitiful answer in return. ""If,"" said Agamemnon, ""you aresons of Antimachus, who once at a council of Trojans proposed thatMenelaus and Ulysses, who had come to you as envoys, should bekilled and not suffered to return, you shall now pay for the fouliniquity of your father.""

ííííAs he spoke he felled Pisander from his chariot to the earth,smiting him on the chest with his spear, so that he lay face uppermostupon the ground. Hippolochus fled, but him too did Agamemnon smite; hecut off his hands and his head- which he sent rolling in among thecrowd as though it were a ball. There he let them both lie, andwherever the ranks were thickest thither he flew, while the otherAchaeans followed. Foot soldiers drove the foot soldiers of the foe inrout before them, and slew them; horsemen did the like by horsemen,and the thundering tramp of the horses raised a cloud of dust frim offthe plain. King Agamemnon followed after, ever slaying them andcheering on the Achaeans. As when some mighty forest is all ablaze-the eddying gusts whirl fire in all directions till the thicketsshrivel and are consumed before the blast of the flame- even so fellthe heads of the flying Trojans before Agamemnon son of Atreus, andmany a noble pair of steeds drew an empty chariot along the highwaysof war, for lack of drivers who were lying on the plain, more usefulnow to vultures than to their wives.

ííííJove drew Hector away from the darts and dust, with the carnageand din of battle; but the son of Atreus sped onwards, calling outlustily to the Danaans. They flew on by the tomb of old Ilus, son ofDardanus, in the middle of the plain, and past the place of the wildfig-tree making always for the city- the son of Atreus still shouting,and with hands all bedrabbled in gore; but when they had reached theScaean gates and the oak tree, there they halted and waited for theothers to come up. Meanwhile the Trojans kept on flying over themiddle of the plain like a herd cows maddened with fright when alion has attacked them in the dead of night- he springs on one ofthem, seizes her neck in the grip of his strong teeth and then laps upher blood and gorges himself upon her entrails- even so did KingAgamemnon son of Atreus pursue the foe, ever slaughtering the hindmostas they fled pell-mell before him. Many a man was flung headlongfrom his chariot by the hand of the son of Atreus, for he wieldedhis spear with fury.

ííííBut when he was just about to reach the high wall and the city,the father of gods and men came down from heaven and took his seat,thunderbolt in hand, upon the crest of many-fountained Ida. He thentold Iris of the golden wings to carry a message for him. ""Go,"" saidhe, ""fleet Iris, and speak thus to Hector-  say that so long as hesees Agamemnon heading his men and making havoc of the Trojan ranks,he is to keep aloof and bid the others bear the brunt of the battle,but when Agamemnon is wounded either by spear or arrow, and takes tohis chariot, then will I vouchsafe him strength to slay till hereach the ships and night falls at the going down of the sun.""

ííííIris hearkened and obeyed. Down she went to strong Ilius from thecrests of Ida, and found Hector son of Priam standing by his chariotand horses. Then she said, ""Hector son of Priam, peer of gods incounsel, father Jove has sent me to bear you this message- so longas you see Agamemnon heading his men and making havoc of the Trojanranks, you are to keep aloof and bid the others bear the brunt ofthe battle, but when Agamemnon is wounded either by spear or arrow,and takes to his chariot, then will Jove vouchsafe you strength toslay till you reach the ships, and till night falls at the goingdown of the sun.""

ííííWhen she had thus spoken Iris left him, and Hector sprang full armedfrom his chariot to the ground, brandishing his spear as he went abouteverywhere among the host, cheering his men on to fight, andstirring the dread strife of battle. The Trojans then wheeled round,and again met the Achaeans, while the Argives on their partstrengthened their battalions. The battle was now in array and theystood face to face with one another, Agamemnon ever pressing forwardin his eagerness to be ahead of all others.

ííííTell me now ye Muses that dwell in the mansions of Olympus, who,whether of the Trojans or of their allies, was first to faceAgamemnon? It was Iphidamas son of Antenor, a man both brave and ofgreat stature, who was brought up in fertile Thrace the mother ofsheep. Cisses, his mother's father, brought him up in his own housewhen he was a child- Cisses, father to fair Theano. When he reachedmanhood, Cisses would have kept him there, and was for giving himhis daughter in marriage, but as soon as he had married he set outto fight the Achaeans with twelve ships that followed him: these hehad left at Percote and had come on by land to Ilius. He it was thatnaw met Agamemnon son of Atreus. When they were close up with oneanother, the son of Atreus missed his aim, and Iphidamas hit him onthe girdle below the cuirass and then flung himself upon him, trustingto his strength of arm; the girdle, however, was not pierced, nornearly so, for the point of the spear struck against the silver andwas turned aside as though it had been lead: King Agamemnon caughtit from his hand, and drew it towards him with the fury of a lion;he then drew his sword, and killed Iphidamas by striking him on theneck. So there the poor fellow lay, sleeping a sleep as it were ofbronze, killed in the defence of his fellow-citizens, far from hiswedded wife, of whom he had had no joy though he had given much forher: he had given a hundred-head of cattle down, and had promisedlater on to give a thousand sheep and goats mixed, from thecountless flocks of which he was possessed. Agamemnon son of Atreusthen despoiled him, and carried off his armour into the host of theAchaeans.

ííííWhen noble Coon, Antenor's eldest son, saw this, sore indeed werehis eyes at the sight of his fallen brother. Unseen by Agamemnon hegot beside him, spear in hand, and wounded him in the middle of hisarm below the elbow, the point of the spear going right through thearm. Agamemnon was convulsed with pain, but still not even for thisdid he leave off struggling and fighting, but grasped his spear thatflew as fleet as the wind, and sprang upon Coon who was trying to dragoff the body of his brother- his father's son- by the foot, and wascrying for help to all the bravest of his comrades; but Agamemnonstruck him with a bronze-shod spear and killed him as he wasdragging the dead body through the press of men under cover of hisshield: he then cut off his head, standing over the body of Iphidamas.Thus did the sons of Antenor meet their fate at the hands of the sonof Atreus, and go down into the house of Hades.

ííííAs long as the blood still welled warm from his wound Agamemnon wentabout attacking the ranks of the enemy with spear and sword and withgreat handfuls of stone, but when the blood had ceased to flow and thewound grew dry, the pain became great. As the sharp pangs which theEilithuiae, goddesses of childbirth, daughters of Juno anddispensers of cruel pain, send upon a woman when she is in labour-even so sharp were the pangs of the son of Atreus. He sprang on to hischariot, and bade his charioteer drive to the ships, for he was ingreat agony. With a loud clear voice he shouted to the Danaans, ""Myfriends, princes and counsellors of the Argives, defend the shipsyourselves, for Jove has not suffered me to fight the whole daythrough against the Trojans.""

ííííWith this the charioteer turned his horses towards the ships, andthey flew forward nothing loth. Their chests were white with foamand their bellies with dust, as they drew the wounded king out ofthe battle.

ííííWhen Hector saw Agamemnon quit the field, he shouted to theTrojans and Lycians saying, ""Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanian warriors,be men, my friends, and acquit yourselves in battle bravely; theirbest man has left them, and Jove has vouchsafed me a great triumph;charge the foe with your chariots that. you may win still greaterglory.""

ííííWith these words he put heart and soul into them all, and as ahuntsman hounds his dogs on against a lion or wild boar, even so didHector, peer of Mars, hound the proud Trojans on against the Achaeans.Full of hope he plunged in among the foremost, and fell on the fightlike some fierce tempest that swoops down upon the sea, and lashes itsdeep blue waters into fury.

ííííWhat, then is the full tale of those whom Hector son of Priam killedin the hour of triumph which Jove then vouchsafed him? First Asaeus,Autonous, and Opites; Dolops son of Clytius, Opheltius and Agelaus;Aesymnus, Orus and Hipponous steadfast in battle; these chieftainsof the Achaeans did Hector slay, and then he fell upon the rank andfile. As when the west wind hustles the clouds of the white southand beats them down with the fierceness of its fury- the waves ofthe sea roll high, and the spray is flung aloft in the rage of thewandering wind- even so thick were the heads of them that fell bythe hand of Hector.

ííííAll had then been lost and no help for it, and the Achaeans wouldhave fled pell-mell to their ships, had not Ulysses cried out toDiomed, ""Son of Tydeus, what has happened to us that we thus forgetour prowess? Come, my good fellow, stand by my side and help me, weshall be shamed for ever if Hector takes the ships.""

ííííAnd Diomed answered, ""Come what may, I will stand firm; but we shallhave scant joy of it, for Jove is minded to give victory to theTrojans rather than to us.""

ííííWith these words he struck Thymbraeus from his chariot to theground, smiting him in the left breast with his spear, while Ulysseskilled Molion who was his squire. These they let lie, now that theyhad stopped their fighting; the two heroes then went on playinghavoc with the foe, like two wild boars that turn in fury and rend thehounds that hunt them. Thus did they turn upon the Trojans and slaythem, and the Achaeans were thankful to have breathing time in theirflight from Hector.

ííííThey then took two princes with their chariot, the two sons ofMerops of Percote, who excelled all others in the arts ofdivination. He had forbidden his sons to go to the war, but they wouldnot obey him, for fate lured them to their fall. Diomed son ofTydeus slew them both and stripped them of their armour, while Ulysseskilled Hippodamus and Hypeirochus.

ííííAnd now the son of Saturn as he looked down from Ida ordained thatneither side should have the advantage, and they kept on killing oneanother. The son of Tydeus speared Agastrophus son of Paeon in thehip-joint with his spear. His chariot was not at hand for him to flywith, so blindly confident had he been. His squire was in charge of itat some distance and he was fighting on foot among the foremostuntil he lost his life. Hector soon marked the havoc Diomed andUlysses were making, and bore down upon them with a loud cry, followedby the Trojan ranks; brave Diomed was dismayed when he saw them, andsaid to Ulysses who was beside him, ""Great Hector is bearing down uponus and we shall be undone; let us stand firm and wait his onset.""

ííííHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it, nor did he miss hismark. He had aimed at Hector's head near the top of his helmet, butbronze was turned by bronze, and Hector was untouched, for the spearwas stayed by the visored helm made with three plates of metal,which Phoebus Apollo had given him. Hector sprang back with a greatbound under cover of the ranks; he fell on his knees and proppedhimself with his brawny hand leaning on the ground, for darkness hadfallen on his eyes. The son of Tydeus having thrown his spear dashedin among the foremost fighters, to the place where he had seen itstrike the ground; meanwhile Hector recovered himself and springingback into his chariot mingled with the crowd, by which means hesaved his life. But Diomed made at him with his spear and said,""Dog, you have again got away though death was close on your heels.Phoebus Apollo, to whom I ween you pray ere you go into battle, hasagain saved you, nevertheless I will meet you and make and end ofyou hereafter, if there is any god who will stand by me too and bemy helper. For the present I must pursue those I can lay hands on.""

ííííAs he spoke he began stripping the spoils from the son of Paeon, butAlexandrus husband of lovely Helen aimed an arrow at him, leaningagainst a pillar of the monument which men had raised to Ilus son ofDardanus, a ruler in days of old. Diomed had taken the cuirass fromoff the breast of Agastrophus, his heavy helmet also, and the shieldfrom off his shoulders, when Paris drew his bow and let fly an arrowthat sped not from his hand in vain, but pierced the flat ofDiomed's right foot, going right through it and fixing itself in theground. Thereon Paris with a hearty laugh sprang forward from hishiding-place, and taunted him saying, ""You are wounded- my arrow hasnot been shot in vain; would that it had hit you in the belly andkilled you, for thus the Trojans, who fear you as goats fear a lion,would have had a truce from evil.""

ííííDiomed all undaunted answered, ""Archer, you who without your bow arenothing, slanderer and seducer, if you were to be tried in singlecombat fighting in full armour, your bow and your arrows would serveyou in little stead. Vain is your boast in that you have scratched thesole of my foot. I care no more than if a girl or some silly boy hadhit me. A worthless coward can inflict but a light wound; when I wounda man though I but graze his skin it is another matter, for myweapon will lay him low. His wife will tear her cheeks for grief andhis children will be fatherless: there will he rot, reddening theearth with his blood, and vultures, not women, will gather round him.""

ííííThus he spoke, but Ulysses came up and stood over him. Under thiscover he sat down to draw the arrow from his foot, and sharp was thepain he suffered as he did so. Then he sprang on to his chariot andbade the charioteer drive him to the ships, for he was sick at heart.

ííííUlysses was now alone; not one of the Argives stood by him, for theywere all panic-stricken. ""Alas,"" said he to himself in his dismay,""what will become of me? It is ill if I turn and fly before theseodds, but it will be worse if I am left alone and taken prisoner,for the son of Saturn has struck the rest of the Danaans with panic.But why talk to myself in this way? Well do I know that though cowardsquit the field, a hero, whether he wound or be wounded, must standfirm and hold his own.""

ííííWhile he was thus in two minds, the ranks of the Trojans advancedand hemmed him in, and bitterly did they come to me it. As houndsand lusty youths set upon a wild boar that sallies from his lairwhetting his white tusks- they attack him from every side and can hearthe gnashing of his jaws, but for all his fierceness they still holdtheir ground- even so furiously did the Trojans attack Ulysses.First he sprang spear in hand upon Deiopites and wounded him on theshoulder with a downward blow; then he killed Thoon and Ennomus. Afterthese he struck Chersidamas in the loins under his shield as he hadjust sprung down from his chariot; so he fell in the dust and clutchedthe earth in the hollow of his hand. These he let lie, and went onto wound Charops son of Hippasus own brother to noble Socus. Socus,hero that he was, made all speed to help him, and when he was close toUlysses he said, ""Far-famed Ulysses, insatiable of craft and toil,this day you shall either boast of having killed both the sons ofHippasus and stripped them of their armour, or you shall fall beforemy spear.""

ííííWith these words he struck the shield of Ulysses. The spear wentthrough the shield and passed on through his richly wrought cuirass,tearing the flesh from his side, but Pallas Minerva did not sufferit to pierce the entrails of the hero. Ulysses knew that his hourwas not yet come, but he gave ground and said to Socus, ""Wretch, youshall now surely die. You have stayed me from fighting further withthe Trojans, but you shall now fall by my spear, yielding glory tomyself, and your soul to Hades of the noble steeds.""

ííííSocus had turned in flight, but as he did so, the spear struck himin the back midway between the shoulders, and went right through hischest. He fell heavily to the ground and Ulysses vaunted over himsaying, ""O Socus, son of Hippasus tamer of horses, death has beentoo quick for you and you have not escaped him: poor wretch, noteven in death shall your father and mother close your eyes, but theravening vultures shall enshroud you with the flapping of their darkwings and devour you. Whereas even though I fall the Achaeans willgive me my due rites of burial.""

ííííSo saying he drew Socus's heavy spear out of his flesh and fromhis shield, and the blood welled forth when the spear was withdrawn sothat he was much dismayed. When the Trojans saw that Ulysses wasbleeding they raised a great shout and came on in a body towardshim; he therefore gave ground, and called his comrades to come andhelp him. Thrice did he cry as loudly as man can cry, and thrice didbrave Menelaus hear him; he turned, therefore, to Ajax who was closebeside him and said, ""Ajax, noble son of Telamon, captain of yourpeople, the cry of Ulysses rings in my ears, as though the Trojans hadcut him off and were worsting him while he is single-handed. Let usmake our way through the throng; it will be well that we defend him; Ifear he may come to harm for all his valour if he be left withoutsupport, and the Danaans would miss him sorely.""

ííííHe led the way and mighty Ajax went with him. The Trojans hadgathered round Ulysses like ravenous mountain jackals round thecarcase of some homed stag that has been hit with an arrow- the staghas fled at full speed so long as his blood was warm and hisstrength has lasted, but when the arrow has overcome him, the savagejackals devour him in the shady glades of the forest. Then heavensends a fierce lion thither, whereon the jackals fly in terror and thelion robs them of their prey- even so did Trojans many and bravegather round crafty Ulysses, but the hero stood at bay and kept themoff with his spear. Ajax then came up with his shield before himlike a wall, and stood hard by, whereon the Trojans fled in alldirections. Menelaus took Ulysses by the hand, and led him out ofthe press while his squire brought up his chariot, but Ajax rushedfuriously on the Trojans and killed Doryclus, a bastard son ofPriam; then he wounded Pandocus, Lysandrus, Pyrasus, and Pylartes;as some swollen torrent comes rushing in full flood from the mountainson to the plain, big with the rain of heaven- many a dry oak andmany a pine does it engulf, and much mud does it bring down and castinto the sea- even so did brave Ajax chase the foe furiously overthe plain, slaying both men and horses.

ííííHector did not yet know what Ajax was doing, for he was fightingon the extreme left of the battle by the banks of the river Scamander,where the carnage was thickest and the war-cry loudest round Nestorand brave Idomeneus. Among these Hector was making great slaughterwith his spear and furious driving, and was destroying the ranksthat were opposed to him; still the Achaeans would have given noground, had not Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen stayed theprowess of Machaon shepherd of his people, by wounding him in theright shoulder with a triple-barbed arrow. The Achaeans were ingreat fear that as the fight had turned against them the Trojans mighttake him prisoner, and Idomeneus said to Nestor, ""Nestor son ofNeleus, honour to the Achaean name, mount your chariot at once; takeMachaon with you and drive your horses to the ships as fast as youcan. A physician is worth more than several other men put together,for he can cut out arrows and spread healing herbs.""

ííííNestor knight of Gerene did as Idomeneus had counselled; he atonce mounted his chariot, and Machaon son of the famed physicianAesculapius went with him. He lashed his horses and they flew onwardnothing loth towards the ships, as though of their own free will.

ííííThen Cebriones seeing the Trojans in confusion said to Hector fromhis place beside him, ""Hector, here are we two fighting on the extremewing of the battle, while the other Trojans are in pell-mell rout,they and their horses. Ajax son of Telamon is driving them before him;I know him by the breadth of his shield: let us turn our chariot andhorses thither, where horse and foot are fighting most desperately,and where the cry of battle is loudest.""

ííííWith this he lashed his goodly steeds, and when they felt the whipthey drew the chariot full speed among the Achaeans and Trojans,over the bodies and shields of those that had fallen: the axle wasbespattered with blood, and the rail round the car was covered withsplashes both from the horses' hoofs and from the tyres of the wheels.Hector tore his way through and flung himself into the thick of thefight, and his presence threw the Danaans into confusion, for hisspear was not long idle; nevertheless though he went among the rankswith sword and spear, and throwing great stones, he avoided Ajax sonof Telamon, for Jove would have been angry with him if he had fought abetter man than himself.

ííííThen father Jove from his high throne struck fear into the heartof Ajax, so that he stood there dazed and threw his shield behind him-looking fearfully at the throng of his foes as though he were somewild beast, and turning hither and thither but crouching slowlybackwards. As peasants with their hounds chase a lion from theirstockyard, and watch by night to prevent his carrying off the pickof their herd- he makes his greedy spring, but in vain, for thedarts from many a strong hand fall thick around him, with burningbrands that scare him for all his fury, and when morning comes heslinks foiled and angry away- even so did Ajax, sorely against hiswill, retreat angrily before the Trojans, fearing for the ships of theAchaeans. Or as some lazy ass that has had many a cudgel brokenabout his back, when he into a field begins eating the corn- boys beathim but he is too many for them, and though they lay about withtheir sticks they cannot hurt him; still when he has had his fill theyat last drive him from the field- even so did the Trojans and theirallies pursue great Ajax, ever smiting the middle of his shield withtheir darts. Now and again he would turn and show fight, keepingback the battalions of the Trojans, and then he would again retreat;but he prevented any of them from making his way to the ships.Single-handed he stood midway between the Trojans and Achaeans: thespears that sped from their hands stuck some of them in his mightyshield, while many, though thirsting for his blood, fell to the groundere they could reach him to the wounding of his fair flesh.

ííííNow when Eurypylus the brave son of Euaemon saw that Ajax wasbeing overpowered by the rain of arrows, he went up to him andhurled his spear. He struck Apisaon son of Phausius in the liver belowthe midriff, and laid him low. Eurypylus sprang upon him, and strippedthe armour from his shoulders; but when Alexandrus saw him, he aimedan arrow at him which struck him in the right thigh; the arrowbroke, but the point that was left in the wound dragged on thethigh; he drew back, therefore, under cover of his comrades to savehis life, shouting as he did so to the Danaans, ""My friends, princesand counsellors of the Argives, rally to the defence of Ajax who isbeing overpowered, and I doubt whether he will come out of the fightalive. Hither, then, to the rescue of great Ajax son of Telamon.""

ííííEven so did he cry when he was wounded; thereon the others camenear, and gathered round him, holding their shields upwards from theirshoulders so as to give him cover. Ajax then made towards them, andturned round to stand at bay as soon as he had reached his men.

ííííThus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. Meanwhile themares of Neleus, all in a lather with sweat, were bearing Nestor outof the fight, and with him Machaon shepherd of his people. Achillessaw and took note, for he was standing on the stern of his shipwatching the hard stress and struggle of the fight. He called from theship to his comrade Patroclus, who heard him in the tent and cameout looking like Mars himself- here indeed was the beginning of theill that presently befell him. ""Why,"" said he, ""Achilles do you callme? what do you what do you want with me?"" And Achilles answered,""Noble son of Menoetius, man after my own heart, I take it that Ishall now have the Achaeans praying at my knees, for they are in greatstraits; go, Patroclus, and ask Nestor who is that he is bearingaway wounded from the field; from his back I should say it was Machaonson of Aesculapius, but I could not see his face for the horses wentby me at full speed.""

ííííPatroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him, and set offrunning by the ships and tents of the Achaeans.

ííííWhen Nestor and Machaon had reached the tents of the son ofNeleus, they dismounted, and an esquire, Eurymedon, took the horsesfrom the chariot. The pair then stood in the breeze by the seasideto dry the sweat from their shirts, and when they had so done theycame inside and took their seats. Fair Hecamede, whom Nestor had hadawarded to him from Tenedos when Achilles took it, mixed them amess; she was daughter of wise Arsinous, and the Achaeans had givenher to Nestor because he excelled all of them in counsel. First sheset for them a fair and well-made table that had feet of cyanus; on itthere was a vessel of bronze and an onion to give relish to the drink,with honey and cakes of barley-meal. There was also a cup of rareworkmanship which the old man had brought with him from home,studded with bosses of gold; it had four handles, on each of whichthere were two golden doves feeding, and it had two feet to standon. Any one else would hardly have been able to lift it from the tablewhen it was full, but Nestor could do so quite easily. In this thewoman, as fair as a goddess, mixed them a mess with Pramnian wine; shegrated goat's milk cheese into it with a bronze grater, threw in ahandful of white barley-meal, and having thus prepared the mess shebade them drink it. When they had done so and had thus quenchedtheir thirst, they fell talking with one another, and at this momentPatroclus appeared at the door.

ííííWhen the old man saw him he sprang from his seat, seized his hand,led him into the tent, and bade him take his place among them; butPatroclus stood where he was and said, ""Noble sir, I may not stay, youcannot persuade me to come in; he that sent me is not one to betrifled with, and he bade me ask who the wounded man was whom you werebearing away from the field. I can now see for myself that he isMachaon shepherd of his people. I must go back and tell Achilles. You,sir, know what a terrible man he is, and how ready to blame even whereno blame should lie.""

ííííAnd Nestor answered, ""Why should Achilles care to know how many ofthe Achaeans may be wounded? He recks not of the dismay that reigns inour host; our most valiant chieftains lie disabled, brave Diomed sonof Tydeus is wounded; so are Ulysses and Agamemnon; Eurypylus has beenhit with an arrow in the thigh, and I have just been bringing this manfrom the field- he too wounded- with an arrow; neverthelessAchilles, so valiant though he be, cares not and knows no ruth. Willhe wait till the ships, do what we may, are in a blaze, and weperish one upon the other? As for me, I have no strength nor stay inme any longer; would that I Were still young and strong as in the dayswhen there was a fight between us and the men of Elis about somecattle-raiding. I then killed Itymoneus the valiant son of Hypeirochusa dweller in Elis, as I was driving in the spoil; he was hit by a dartthrown my hand while fighting in the front rank in defence of hiscows, so he fell and the country people around him were in great fear.We drove off a vast quantity of booty from the plain, fifty herds ofcattle and as many flocks of sheep; fifty droves also of pigs, andas many wide-spreading flocks of goats. Of horses moreover we seized ahundred and fifty, all of them mares, and many had foals runningwith them. All these did we drive by night to Pylus the city ofNeleus, taking them within the city; and the heart of Neleus wasglad in that I had taken so much, though it was the first time I hadever been in the field. At daybreak the heralds went round crying thatall in Elis to whom there was a debt owing should come; and theleading Pylians assembled to divide the spoils. There were many towhom the Epeans owed chattels, for we men of Pylus were few and hadbeen oppressed with wrong; in former years Hercules had come, andhad laid his hand heavy upon us, so that all our best men hadperished. Neleus had had twelve sons, but I alone was left; the othershad all been killed. The Epeans presuming upon all this had lookeddown upon us and had done us much evil. My father chose a herd ofcattle and a great flock of sheep- three hundred in all- and he tooktheir shepherds with him, for there was a great debt due to him inElis, to wit four horses, winners of prizes. They and their chariotswith them had gone to the games and were to run for a tripod, but KingAugeas took them, and sent back their driver grieving for the lossof his horses. Neleus was angered by what he had both said and done,and took great value in return, but he divided the rest, that no manmight have less than his full share.

íííí""Thus did we order all things, and offer sacrifices to the godsthroughout the city; but three days afterwards the Epeans came in abody, many in number, they and their chariots, in full array, and withthem the two Moliones in their armour, though they were still lads andunused to fighting. Now there is a certain town, Thryoessa, perchedupon a rock on the river Alpheus, the border city Pylus; this theywould destroy, and pitched their camp about it, but when they hadcrossed their whole plain, Minerva darted down by night from Olympusand bade us set ourselves in array; and she found willing soldiersin Pylos, for the men meant fighting. Neleus would not let me arm, andhid my horses, for he said that as yet I could know nothing about war;nevertheless Minerva so ordered the fight that, all on foot as Iwas, I fought among our mounted forces and vied with the foremost ofthem. There is a river Minyeius that falls into the sea near Arene,and there they that were mounted (and I with them) waited tillmorning, when the companies of foot soldiers came up with us in force.Thence in full panoply and equipment we came towards noon to thesacred waters of the Alpheus, and there we offered victims to almightyJove, with a bull to Alpheus, another to Neptune, and a herd-heifer toMinerva. After this we took supper in our companies, and laid usdown to rest each in his armour by the river.

íííí""The Epeans were beleaguering the city and were determined to takeit, but ere this might be there was a desperate fight in store forthem. When the sun's rays began to fall upon the earth we joinedbattle, praying to Jove and to Minerva, and when the fight hadbegun, I was the first to kill my man and take his horses- to witthe warrior Mulius. He was son-in-law to Augeas, having married hiseldest daughter, golden-haired Agamede, who knew the virtues ofevery herb which grows upon the face of the earth. I speared him as hewas coming towards me, and when he fell headlong in the dust, I sprangupon his chariot and took my place in the front ranks. The Epeans fledin all directions when they saw the captain of their horsemen (thebest man they had) laid low, and I swept down on them like awhirlwind, taking fifty chariots- and in each of them two men bitthe dust, slain by my spear. I should have even killed the twoMoliones sons of Actor, unless their real father, Neptune lord ofthe earthquake, had hidden them in a thick mist and borne them outof the fight. Thereon Jove vouchsafed the Pylians a great victory, forwe chased them far over the plain, killing the men and bringing intheir armour, till we had brought our horses to Buprasium rich inwheat and to the Olenian rock, with the hill that is called Alision,at which point Minerva turned the people back. There I slew the lastman and left him; then the Achaeans drove their horses back fromBuprasium to Pylos and gave thanks to Jove among the gods, and amongmortal men to Nestor.

íííí""Such was I among my peers, as surely as ever was, but Achilles isfor keeping all his valour for himself; bitterly will he rue ithereafter when the host is being cut to pieces. My good friend, didnot Menoetius charge you thus, on the day when he sent you from Phthiato Agamemnon? Ulysses and I were in the house, inside, and heard allthat he said to you; for we came to the fair house of Peleus whilebeating up recruits throughout all Achaea, and when we got there wefound Menoetius and yourself, and Achilles with you. The old knightPeleus was in the outer court, roasting the fat thigh-bones of aheifer to Jove the lord of thunder; and he held a gold chalice inhis hand from which he poured drink-offerings of wine over the burningsacrifice. You two were busy cutting up the heifer, and at that momentwe stood at the gates, whereon Achilles sprang to his feet, led usby the hand into the house, placed us at table, and set before us suchhospitable entertainment as guests expect. When we had satisfiedourselves with meat and drink, I said my say and urged both of youto join us. You were ready enough to do so, and the two old mencharged you much and straitly. Old Peleus bade his son Achillesfight ever among the foremost and outvie his peers, while Menoetiusthe son of Actor spoke thus to you: 'My son,' said he, 'Achilles is ofnobler birth than you are, but you are older than he, though he is farthe better man of the two. Counsel him wisely, guide him in theright way, and he will follow you to his own profit.' Thus did yourfather charge you, but you have forgotten; nevertheless, even now, sayall this to Achilles if he will listen to you. Who knows but withheaven's help you may talk him over, for it is good to take a friend'sadvice. If, however, he is fearful about some oracle, or if his motherhas told him something from Jove, then let him send you, and let therest of the Myrmidons follow with you, if perchance you may bringlight and saving to the Danaans. And let him send you into battle cladin his own armour, that the Trojans may mistake you for him andleave off fighting; the sons of the Achaeans may thus have time to gettheir breath, for they are hard pressed and there is littlebreathing time in battle. You, who are fresh, might easily drive atired enemy back to his walls and away from the tents and ships.""

ííííWith these words he moved the heart of Patroclus, who set offrunning by the line of the ships to Achilles, descendant of Aeacus.When he had got as far as the ships of Ulysses, where was theirplace of assembly and court of justice, with their altars dedicated tothe gods, Eurypylus son of Euaemon met him, wounded in the thighwith an arrow, and limping out of the fight. Sweat rained from hishead and shoulders, and black blood welled from his cruel wound, buthis mind did not wander. The son of Menoetius when he saw him hadcompassion upon him and spoke piteously saying, ""O unhappy princes andcounsellors of the Danaans, are you then doomed to feed the houndsof Troy with your fat, far from your friends and your native land?say, noble Eurypylus, will the Achaeans be able to hold great Hectorin check, or will they fall now before his spear?""

ííííWounded Eurypylus made answer, ""Noble Patroclus, there is no hopeleft for the Achaeans but they will perish at their ships. All theythat were princes among us are lying struck down and wounded at thehands of the Trojans, who are waxing stronger and stronger. But saveme and take me to your ship; cut out the arrow from my thigh; wash theblack blood from off it with warm water, and lay upon it thosegracious herbs which, so they say, have been shown you by Achilles,who was himself shown them by Chiron, most righteous of all thecentaurs. For of the physicians Podalirius and Machaon, I hear thatthe one is lying wounded in his tent and is himself in need ofhealing, while the other is fighting the Trojans upon the plain.""

íííí""Hero Eurypylus,"" replied the brave son of Menoetius, ""how may thesethings be? What can I do? I am on my way to bear a message to nobleAchilles from Nestor of Gerene, bulwark of the Achaeans, but even so Iwill not be unmindful your distress.""

ííííWith this he clasped him round the middle and led him into the tent,and a servant, when he saw him, spread bullock-skins on the ground forhim to lie on. He laid him at full length and cut out the sharparrow from his thigh; he washed the black blood from the wound withwarm water; he then crushed a bitter herb, rubbing it between hishands, and spread it upon the wound; this was a virtuous herb whichkilled all pain; so the wound presently dried and the blood left offflowing.

ííííBOOK XII

ííííSO THE son of Menoetius was attending to the hurt of Eurypyluswithin the tent, but the Argives and Trojans still fought desperately,nor were the trench and the high wall above it, to keep the Trojans incheck longer. They had built it to protect their ships, and had dugthe trench all round it that it might safeguard both the ships and therich spoils which they had taken, but they had not offered hecatombsto the gods. It had been built without the consent of the immortals,and therefore it did not last. So long as Hector lived and Achillesnursed his anger, and so long as the city of Priam remained untaken,the great wall of the Achaeans stood firm; but when the bravest of theTrojans were no more, and many also of the Argives, though some wereyet left alive when, moreover, the city was sacked in the tenthyear, and the Argives had gone back with their ships to their owncountry- then Neptune and Apollo took counsel to destroy the wall, andthey turned on to it the streams of all the rivers from Mount Ida intothe sea, Rhesus, Heptaporus, Caresus, Rhodius, Grenicus, Aesopus,and goodly Scamander, with Simois, where many a shield and helm hadfallen, and many a hero of the race of demigods had bitten the dust.Phoebus Apollo turned the mouths of all these rivers together and madethem flow for nine days against the wall, while Jove rained thewhole time that he might wash it sooner into the sea. Neptune himself,trident in hand, surveyed the work and threw into the sea all thefoundations of beams and stones which the Achaeans had laid with somuch toil; he made all level by the mighty stream of the Hellespont,and then when he had swept the wall away he spread a great beach ofsand over the place where it had been. This done he turned therivers back into their old courses.

ííííThis was what Neptune and Apollo were to do in after time; but asyet battle and turmoil were still raging round the wall till itstimbers rang under the blows that rained upon them. The Argives, cowedby the scourge of Jove, were hemmed in at their ships in fear ofHector the mighty minister of Rout, who as heretofore fought withthe force and fury of a whirlwind. As a lion or wild boar turnsfiercely on the dogs and men that attack him, while these form solidwall and shower their javelins as they face him- his courage is allundaunted, but his high spirit will be the death of him; many a timedoes he charge at his pursuers to scatter them, and they fall backas often as he does so- even so did Hector go about among the hostexhorting his men, and cheering them on to cross the trench.

ííííBut the horses dared not do so, and stood neighing upon its brink,for the width frightened them. They could neither jump it nor crossit, for it had overhanging banks all round upon either side, abovewhich there were the sharp stakes that the sons of the Achaeans hadplanted so close and strong as a defence against all who wouldassail it; a horse, therefore, could not get into it and draw hischariot after him, but those who were on foot kept trying their veryutmost. Then Polydamas went up to Hector and said, ""Hector, and youother captains of the Trojans and allies, it is madness for us totry and drive our horses across the trench; it will be very hard tocross, for it is full of sharp stakes, and beyond these there is thewall. Our horses therefore cannot get down into it, and would be of nouse if they did; moreover it is a narrow place and we should come toharm. If, indeed, great Jove is minded to help the Trojans, and in hisanger will utterly destroy the Achaeans, I would myself gladly seethem perish now and here far from Argos; but if they should rallyand we are driven back from the ships pell-mell into the trenchthere will be not so much as a man get back to the city to tell thetale. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say; let our squires hold ourhorses by the trench, but let us follow Hector in a body on foot, cladin full armour, and if the day of their doom is at hand the Achaeanswill not be able to withstand us.""

ííííThus spoke Polydamas and his saying pleased Hector, who sprang infull armour to the ground, and all the other Trojans, when they sawhim do so, also left their chariots. Each man then gave his horsesover to his charioteer in charge to hold them ready for him at thetrench. Then they formed themselves into companies, made themselvesready, and in five bodies followed their leaders. Those that went withHector and Polydamas were the bravest and most in number, and the mostdetermined to break through the wall and fight at the ships. Cebrioneswas also joined with them as third in command, for Hector had left hischariot in charge of a less valiant soldier. The next company wasled by Paris, Alcathous, and Agenor; the third by Helenus andDeiphobus, two sons of Priam, and with them was the hero Asius-Asius the son of Hyrtacus, whose great black horses of the breedthat comes from the river Selleis had brought him from Arisbe.Aeneas the valiant son of Anchises led the fourth; he and the two sonsof Antenor, Archelochus and Acamas, men well versed in all the arts ofwar. Sarpedon was captain over the allies, and took with him Glaucusand Asteropaeus whom he deemed most valiant after himself- for hewas far the best man of them all. These helped to array one another intheir ox-hide shields, and then charged straight at the Danaans, forthey felt sure that they would not hold out longer and that theyshould themselves now fall upon the ships.

ííííThe rest of the Trojans and their allies now followed the counsel ofPolydamas but Asius son of Hyrtacus would not leave his horses and hisesquire behind him; in his foolhardiness he took them on with himtowards the ships, nor did he fail to come by his end inconsequence. Nevermore was he to return to wind-beaten Ilius, exultingin his chariot and his horses; ere he could do so, death of ill-omenedname had overshadowed him and he had fallen by the spear ofIdomeneus the noble son of Deucalion. He had driven towards the leftwing of the ships, by which way the Achaeans used to return with theirchariots and horses from the plain. Hither he drove and found thegates with their doors opened wide, and the great bar down- for thegatemen kept them open so as to let those of their comrades enterwho might be flying towards the ships. Hither of set purpose did hedirect his horses, and his men followed him with a loud cry, forthey felt sure that the Achaeans would not hold out longer, and thatthey should now fall upon the ships. Little did they know that atthe gates they should find two of the bravest chieftains, proud sonsof the fighting Lapithae- the one, Polypoetes, mighty son ofPirithous, and the other Leonteus, peer of murderous Mars. These stoodbefore the gates like two high oak trees upon the mountains, thattower from their wide-spreading roots, and year after year battle withwind and rain- even so did these two men await the onset of greatAsius confidently and without flinching. The Trojans led by him and byIamenus, Orestes, Adamas the son of Asius, Thoon and Oenomaus,raised a loud cry of battle and made straight for the wall, holdingtheir shields of dry ox-hide above their heads; for a while the twodefenders remained inside and cheered the Achaeans on to stand firm inthe defence of their ships; when, however, they saw that the Trojanswere attacking the wall, while the Danaans were crying out for helpand being routed, they rushed outside and fought in front of the gateslike two wild boars upon the mountains that abide the attack of menand dogs, and charging on either side break down the wood all roundthem tearing it up by the roots, and one can hear the clattering oftheir tusks, till some one hits them and makes an end of them- even sodid the gleaming bronze rattle about their breasts, as the weaponsfell upon them; for they fought with great fury, trusting to their ownprowess and to those who were on the wall above them. These threwgreat stones at their assailants in defence of themselves theirtents and their ships. The stones fell thick as the flakes of snowwhich some fierce blast drives from the dark clouds and showers downin sheets upon the earth- even so fell the weapons from the handsalike of Trojans and Achaeans. Helmet and shield rang out as the greatstones rained upon them, and Asius the son of Hyrtacus in his dismaycried aloud and smote his two thighs. ""Father Jove,"" he cried, ""of atruth you too are altogether given to lying. I made sure the Argiveheroes could not withstand us, whereas like slim-waisted wasps, orbees that have their nests in the rocks by the wayside- they leave notthe holes wherein they have built undefended, but fight for theirlittle ones against all who would take them- even so these men, thoughthey be but two, will not be driven from the gates, but stand firmeither to slay or be slain.""

ííííHe spoke, but moved not the mind of Jove, whose counsel it thenwas to give glory to Hector. Meanwhile the rest of the Trojans werefighting about the other gates; I, however, am no god to be able totell about all these things, for the battle raged everywhere about thestone wall as it were a fiery furnace. The Argives, discomfited thoughthey were, were forced to defend their ships, and all the gods whowere defending the Achaeans were vexed in spirit; but the Lapithaekept on fighting with might and main.

ííííThereon Polypoetes, mighty son of Pirithous, hit Damasus with aspear upon his cheek-pierced helmet. The helmet did not protect him,for the point of the spear went through it, and broke the bone, sothat the brain inside was scattered about, and he died fighting. Hethen slew Pylon and Ormenus. Leonteus, of the race of Mars, killedHippomachus the son of Antimachus by striking him with his spearupon the girdle. He then drew his sword and sprang first uponAntiphates whom he killed in combat, and who fell face upwards onthe earth. After him he killed Menon, Iamenus, and Orestes, and laidthem low one after the other.

ííííWhile they were busy stripping the armour from these heroes, theyouths who were led on by Polydamas and Hector (and these were thegreater part and the most valiant of those that were trying to breakthrough the wall and fire the ships) were still standing by thetrench, uncertain what they should do; for they had seen a sign fromheaven when they had essayed to cross it- a soaring eagle that flewskirting the left wing of their host, with a monstrous blood-red snakein its talons still alive and struggling to escape. The snake wasstill bent on revenge, wriggling and twisting itself backwards till itstruck the bird that held it, on the neck and breast; whereon the birdbeing in pain, let it fall, dropping it into the middle of the host,and then flew down the wind with a sharp cry. The Trojans werestruck with terror when they saw the snake, portent of aegis-bearingJove, writhing in the midst of them, and Polydamas went up to Hectorand said, ""Hector, at our councils of war you are ever given to rebukeme, even when I speak wisely, as though it were not well, forsooth,that one of the people should cross your will either in the field orat the council board; you would have them support you always:nevertheless I will say what I think will be best; let us not now goon to fight the Danaans at their ships, for I know what will happen ifthis soaring eagle which skirted the left wing of our with a monstrousblood-red snake in its talons (the snake being still alive) was reallysent as an omen to the Trojans on their essaying to cross thetrench. The eagle let go her hold; she did not succeed in taking ithome to her little ones, and so will it be- with ourselves; eventhough by a mighty effort we break through the gates and wall of theAchaeans, and they give way before us, still we shall not return ingood order by the way we came, but shall leave many a man behind uswhom the Achaeans will do to death in defence of their ships. Thuswould any seer who was expert in these matters, and was trusted by thepeople, read the portent.""

ííííHector looked fiercely at him and said, ""Polydamas, I like not ofyour reading. You can find a better saying than this if you will.If, however, you have spoken in good earnest, then indeed has heavenrobbed you of your reason. You would have me pay no heed to thecounsels of Jove, nor to the promises he made me- and he bowed hishead in confirmation; you bid me be ruled rather by the flight ofwild-fowl. What care I whether they fly towards dawn or dark, andwhether they be on my right hand or on my left? Let us put our trustrather in the counsel of great Jove, king of mortals and immortals.There is one omen, and one only- that a man should fight for hiscountry. Why are you so fearful? Though we be all of us slain at theships of the Argives you are not likely to be killed yourself, for youare not steadfast nor courageous. If you will. not fight, or wouldtalk others over from doing so, you shall fall forthwith before myspear.""

ííííWith these words he led the way, and the others followed afterwith a cry that rent the air. Then Jove the lord of thunder sent theblast of a mighty wind from the mountains of Ida, that bore the dustdown towards the ships; he thus lulled the Achaeans into security, andgave victory to Hector and to the Trojans, who, trusting to theirown might and to the signs he had shown them, essayed to break throughthe great wall of the Achaeans. They tore down the breastworks fromthe walls, and overthrew the battlements; they upheaved thebuttresses, which the Achaeans had set in front of the wall in orderto support it; when they had pulled these down they made sure ofbreaking through the wall, but the Danaans still showed no sign ofgiving ground; they still fenced the battlements with their shields ofox-hide, and hurled their missiles down upon the foe as soon as anycame below the wall.

ííííThe two Ajaxes went about everywhere on the walls cheering on theAchaeans, giving fair words to some while they spoke sharply to anyone whom they saw to be remiss. ""My friends,"" they cried, ""Argives oneand all- good bad and indifferent, for there was never fight yet, inwhich all were of equal prowess- there is now work enough, as you verywell know, for all of you. See that you none of you turn in flighttowards the ships, daunted by the shouting of the foe, but pressforward and keep one another in heart, if it may so be that OlympianJove the lord of lightning will vouchsafe us to repel our foes, anddrive them back towards the city.""

ííííThus did the two go about shouting and cheering the Achaeans on.As the flakes that fall thick upon a winter's day, when Jove is mindedto snow and to display these his arrows to mankind- he lulls thewind to rest, and snows hour after hour till he has buried the tops ofthe high mountains, the headlands that jut into the sea, the grassyplains, and the tilled fields of men; the snow lies deep upon theforelands, and havens of the grey sea, but the waves as they comerolling in stay it that it can come no further, though all else iswrapped as with a mantle so heavy are the heavens with snow- even thusthickly did the stones fall on one side and on the other, somethrown at the Trojans, and some by the Trojans at the Achaeans; andthe whole wall was in an uproar.

ííííStill the Trojans and brave Hector would not yet have broken downthe gates and the great bar, had not Jove turned his son Sarpedonagainst the Argives as a lion against a herd of horned cattle.Before him he held his shield of hammered bronze, that the smith hadbeaten so fair and round, and had lined with ox hides which he hadmade fast with rivets of gold all round the shield; this he held infront of him, and brandishing his two spears came on like some lion ofthe wilderness, who has been long famished for want of meat and willdare break even into a well-fenced homestead to try and get at thesheep. He may find the shepherds keeping watch over their flockswith dogs and spears, but he is in no mind to be driven from thefold till he has had a try for it; he will either spring on a sheepand carry it off, or be hit by a spear from strong hand- even so wasSarpedon fain to attack the wall and break down its battlements.Then he said to Glaucus son of Hippolochus, ""Glaucus, why in Lyciado we receive especial honour as regards our place at table? Why arethe choicest portions served us and our cups kept brimming, and why domen look up to us as though we were gods? Moreover we hold a largeestate by the banks of the river Xanthus, fair with orchard lawnsand wheat-growing land; it becomes us, therefore, to take our stand atthe head of all the Lycians and bear the brunt of the fight, thatone may say to another, Our princes in Lycia eat the fat of the landand drink best of wine, but they are fine fellows; they fight well andare ever at the front in battle.' My good friend, if, when we wereonce out of this fight, we could escape old age and deaththenceforward and for ever, I should neither press forward myselfnor bid you do so, but death in ten thousand shapes hangs ever overour heads, and no man can elude him; therefore let us go forward andeither win glory for ourselves, or yield it to another.""

ííííGlaucus heeded his saying, and the pair forthwith led on the host ofLycians. Menestheus son of Peteos was dismayed when he saw them, forit was against his part of the wall that they came- bringingdestruction with them; he looked along the wall for some chieftainto support his comrades and saw the two Ajaxes, men ever eager for thefray, and Teucer, who had just come from his tent, standing near them;but he could not make his voice heard by shouting to them, so great anuproar was there from crashing shields and helmets and the batteringof gates with a din which reached the skies. For all the gates hadbeen closed, and the Trojans were hammering at them to try and breaktheir way through them. Menestheus, therefore, sent Thootes with amessage to Ajax. ""Run, good Thootes,"" said and call Ajax, or betterstill bid both come, for it will be all over with us here directly;the leaders of the Lycians are upon us, men who have ever foughtdesperately heretofore. But if the have too much on their hands to letthem come, at any rate let Ajax son of Telamon do so, and let Teucerthe famous bowman come with him.""

ííííThe messenger did as he was told, and set off running along the wallof the Achaeans. When he reached the Ajaxes he said to them, ""Sirs,princes of the Argives, the son of noble Peteos bids you come to himfor a while and help him. You had better both come if you can, or itwill be all over with him directly; the leaders of the Lycians areupon him, men who have ever fought desperately heretofore; if you havetoo much on your hands to let both come, at any rate let Ajax son ofTelamon do so, and let Teucer the famous bowman come with him.""

ííííGreat Ajax, son of Telamon, heeded the message, and at once spoke tothe son of Oileus. ""Ajax,"" said he, ""do you two, yourself and braveLycomedes, stay here and keep the Danaans in heart to fight theirhardest. I will go over yonder, and bear my part in the fray, but Iwill come back here at once as soon as I have given them the help theyneed.""

ííííWith this, Ajax son of Telamon set off, and Teucer his brother bythe same father went also, with Pandion to carry Teucer's bow. Theywent along inside the wall, and when they came to the tower whereMenestheus was (and hard pressed indeed did they find him) the bravecaptains and leaders of the Lycians were storming the battlements asit were a thick dark cloud, fighting in close quarters, and raisingthe battle-cry aloud.

ííííFirst, Ajax son of Telamon killed brave Epicles, a comrade ofSarpedon, hitting him with a jagged stone that lay by thebattlements at the very top of the wall. As men now are, even onewho is in the bloom of youth could hardly lift it with his twohands, but Ajax raised it high aloft and flung it down, smashingEpicles' four-crested helmet so that the bones of his head werecrushed to pieces, and he fell from the high wall as though he werediving, with no more life left in him. Then Teucer wounded Glaucus thebrave son of Hippolochus as he was coming on to attack the wall. Hesaw his shoulder bare and aimed an arrow at it, which made Glaucusleave off fighting. Thereon he sprang covertly down for fear some ofthe Achaeans might see that he was wounded and taunt him. Sarpedon wasstung with grief when he saw Glaucus leave him, still he did not leaveoff fighting, but aimed his spear at Alcmaon the son of Thestor andhit him. He drew his spear back again Alcmaon came down headlong afterit with his bronzed armour rattling round him. Then Sarpedon seizedthe battlement in his strong hands, and tugged at it till it an gaveway together, and a breach was made through which many might pass.

ííííAjax and Teucer then both of them attacked him. Teucer hit himwith an arrow on the band that bore the shield which covered his body,but Jove saved his son from destruction that he might not fall bythe ships' sterns. Meanwhile Ajax sprang on him and pierced hisshield, but the spear did not go clean through, though it hustledhim back that he could come on no further. He therefore retired alittle space from the battlement, yet without losing all his ground,for he still thought to cover himself with glory. Then he turned roundand shouted to the brave Lycians saying, ""Lycians, why do you thusfail me? For all my prowess I cannot break through the wall and open away to the ships single-handed. Come close on behind me, for themore there are of us the better.""

ííííThe Lycians, shamed by his rebuke, pressed closer round him whowas their counsellor their king. The Argives on their part got theirmen in fighting order within the wall, and there was a deadly strugglebetween them. The Lycians could not break through the wall and forcetheir way to the ships, nor could the Danaans drive the Lycians fromthe wall now that they had once reached it. As two men, measuring-rodsin hand, quarrel about their boundaries in a field that they own incommon, and stickle for their rights though they be but in a merestrip, even so did the battlements now serve as a bone ofcontention, and they beat one another's round shields for theirpossession. Many a man's body was wounded with the pitiless bronze, ashe turned round and bared his back to the foe, and many were struckclean through their shields; the wall and battlements wereeverywhere deluged with the blood alike of Trojans and of Achaeans.But even so the Trojans could not rout the Achaeans, who still heldon; and as some honest hard-working woman weighs wool in her balanceand sees that the scales be true, for she would gain some pitifulearnings for her little ones, even so was the fight balanced evenlybetween them till the time came when Jove gave the greater glory toHector son of Priam, who was first to spring towards the wall of theAchaeans. As he did so, he cried aloud to the Trojans, ""Up, Trojans,break the wall of the Argives, and fling fire upon their ships.""

ííííThus did he hound them on, and in one body they rushed straight atthe wall as he had bidden them, and scaled the battlements withsharp spears in their hands. Hector laid hold of a stone that lay justoutside the gates and was thick at one end but pointed at the other;two of the best men in a town, as men now are, could hardly raise itfrom the ground and put it on to a waggon, but Hector lifted itquite easily by himself, for the son of scheming Saturn made itlight for him. As a shepherd picks up a ram's fleece with one hand andfinds it no burden, so easily did Hector lift the great stone anddrive it right at the doors that closed the gates so strong and sofirmly set. These doors were double and high, and were kept closedby two cross-bars to which there was but one key. When he had gotclose up to them, Hector strode towards them that his blow mightgain in force and struck them in the middle, leaning his wholeweight against them. He broke both hinges, and the stone fell insideby reason of its great weight. The portals re-echoed with the sound,the bars held no longer, and the doors flew open, one one way, and theother the other, through the force of the blow. Then brave Hectorleaped inside with a face as dark as that of flying night. Thegleaming bronze flashed fiercely about his body and he had towspears in his hand. None but a god could have withstood him as heflung himself into the gateway, and his eyes glared like fire. Then heturned round towards the Trojans and called on them to scale the wall,and they did as he bade them- some of them at once climbing over thewall, while others passed through the gates. The Danaans then fledpanic-stricken towards their ships, and all was uproar and confusion.

ííííBOOK XIII

ííííNOW when Jove had thus brought Hector and the Trojans to theships, he left them to their never-ending toil, and turned his keeneyes away, looking elsewhither towards the horse-breeders of Thrace,the Mysians, fighters at close quarters, the noble Hippemolgi, wholive on milk, and the Abians, justest of mankind. He no longerturned so much as a glance towards Troy, for he did not think that anyof the immortals would go and help either Trojans or Danaans.

ííííBut King Neptune had kept no blind look-out; he had been lookingadmiringly on the battle from his seat on the topmost crests of woodedSamothrace, whence he could see all Ida, with the city of Priam andthe ships of the Achaeans. He had come from under the sea and takenhis place here, for he pitied the Achaeans who were being overcomeby the Trojans; and he was furiously angry with Jove.

ííííPresently he came down from his post on the mountain top, and ashe strode swiftly onwards the high hills and the forest quaked beneaththe tread of his immortal feet. Three strides he took, and with thefourth he reached his goal- Aegae, where is his glittering goldenpalace, imperishable, in the depths of the sea. When he got there,he yoked his fleet brazen-footed steeds with their manes of gold allflying in the wind; he clothed himself in raiment of gold, grasped hisgold whip, and took his stand upon his chariot. As he went his wayover the waves the sea-monsters left their lairs, for they knewtheir lord, and came gambolling round him from every quarter of thedeep, while the sea in her gladness opened a path before hischariot. So lightly did the horses fly that the bronze axle of the carwas not even wet beneath it; and thus his bounding steeds took himto the ships of the Achaeans.

ííííNow there is a certain huge cavern in the depths of the sea midwaybetween Tenedos and rocky Imbrus; here Neptune lord of theearthquake stayed his horses, unyoked them, and set before themtheir ambrosial forage. He hobbled their feet with hobbles of goldwhich none could either unloose or break, so that they might staythere in that place until their lord should return. This done hewent his way to the host of the Achaeans.

ííííNow the Trojans followed Hector son of Priam in close array like astorm-cloud or flame of fire, fighting with might and main and raisingthe cry battle; for they deemed that they should take the ships of theAchaeans and kill all their chiefest heroes then and there.Meanwhile earth-encircling Neptune lord of the earthquake cheered onthe Argives, for he had come up out of the sea and had assumed theform and voice of Calchas.

ííííFirst he spoke to the two Ajaxes, who were doing their best already,and said, ""Ajaxes, you two can be the saving of the Achaeans if youwill put out all your strength and not let yourselves be daunted. I amnot afraid that the Trojans, who have got over the wall in force, willbe victorious in any other part, for the Achaeans can hold all of themin check, but I much fear that some evil will befall us here wherefurious Hector, who boasts himself the son of great Jove himself, isleading them on like a pillar of flame. May some god, then, put itinto your hearts to make a firm stand here, and to incite others to dothe like. In this case you will drive him from the ships even thoughhe be inspired by Jove himself.""

ííííAs he spoke the earth-encircling lord of the earthquake struckboth of them with his sceptre and filled their hearts with daring.He made their legs light and active, as also their hands and theirfeet. Then, as the soaring falcon poises on the wing high above somesheer rock, and presently swoops down to chase some bird over theplain, even so did Neptune lord of the earthquake wing his flight intothe air and leave them. Of the two, swift Ajax son of Oileus was thefirst to know who it was that had been speaking with them, and said toAjax son of Telamon, ""Ajax, this is one of the gods that dwell onOlympus, who in the likeness of the prophet is bidding us fight hardby our ships. It was not Calchas the seer and diviner of omens; I knewhim at once by his feet and knees as he turned away, for the godsare soon recognised. Moreover I feel the lust of battle burn morefiercely within me, while my hands and my feet under me are more eagerfor the fray.""

ííííAnd Ajax son of Telamon answered, ""I too feel my hands grasp myspear more firmly; my strength is greater, and my feet more nimble;I long, moreover, to meet furious Hector son of Priam, even insingle combat.""

ííííThus did they converse, exulting in the hunger after battle withwhich the god had filled them. Meanwhile the earth-encircler rousedthe Achaeans, who were resting in the rear by the ships overcome atonce by hard fighting and by grief at seeing that the Trojans hadgot over the wall in force. Tears began falling from their eyes asthey beheld them, for they made sure that they should not escapedestruction; but the lord of the earthquake passed lightly about amongthem and urged their battalions to the front.

ííííFirst he went up to Teucer and Leitus, the hero Peneleos, andThoas and Deipyrus; Meriones also and Antilochus, valiant warriors;all did he exhort. ""Shame on you young Argives,"" he cried, ""it wason your prowess I relied for the saving of our ships; if you fight notwith might and main, this very day will see us overcome by theTrojans. Of a truth my eyes behold a great and terrible portentwhich I had never thought to see- the Trojans at our ships- they,who were heretofore like panic-stricken hinds, the prey of jackals andwolves in a forest, with no strength but in flight for they cannotdefend themselves. Hitherto the Trojans dared not for one momentface the attack of the Achaeans, but now they have sallied far fromtheir city and are fighting at our very ships through the cowardice ofour leader and the disaffection of the people themselves, who in theirdiscontent care not to fight in defence of the ships but are beingslaughtered near them. True, King Agamemnon son of Atreus is the causeof our disaster by having insulted the son of Peleus, still this is noreason why we should leave off fighting. Let us be quick to heal,for the hearts of the brave heal quickly. You do ill to be thusremiss, you, who are the finest soldiers in our whole army. I blame noman for keeping out of battle if he is a weakling, but I amindignant with such men as you are. My good friends, matters will soonbecome even worse through this slackness; think, each one of you, ofhis own honour and credit, for the hazard of the fight is extreme.Great Hector is now fighting at our ships; he has broken through thegates and the strong bolt that held them.""

ííííThus did the earth-encircler address the Achaeans and urge themon. Thereon round the two Ajaxes there gathered strong bands of men,of whom not even Mars nor Minerva, marshaller of hosts could makelight if they went among them, for they were the picked men of allthose who were now awaiting the onset of Hector and the Trojans.They made a living fence, spear to spear, shield to shield, buckler tobuckler, helmet to helmet, and man to man. The horse-hair crests ontheir gleaming helmets touched one another as they nodded forward,so closely seffied were they; the spears they brandished in theirstrong hands were interlaced, and their hearts were set on battle.

ííííThe Trojans advanced in a dense body, with Hector at their headpressing right on as a rock that comes thundering down the side ofsome mountain from whose brow the winter torrents have torn it; thefoundations of the dull thing have been loosened by floods of rain,and as it bounds headlong on its way it sets the whole forest in anuproar; it swerves neither to right nor left till it reaches levelground, but then for all its fury it can go no further- even so easilydid Hector for a while seem as though he would career through thetents and ships of the Achaeans till he had reached the sea in hismurderous course; but the closely serried battalions stayed him whenhe reached them, for the sons of the Achaeans thrust at him withswords and spears pointed at both ends, and drove him from them sothat he staggered and gave ground; thereon he shouted to theTrojans, ""Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians, fighters in closecombat, stand firm: the Achaeans have set themselves as a wall againstme, but they will not check me for long; they will give groundbefore me if the mightiest of the gods, the thundering spouse of Juno,has indeed inspired my onset.""

ííííWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Deiphobusson of Priam went about among them intent on deeds of daring withhis round shield before him, under cover of which he strode quicklyforward. Meriones took aim at him with a spear, nor did he fail to hitthe broad orb of ox-hide; but he was far from piercing it for thespear broke in two pieces long ere he could do so; moreoverDeiphobus had seen it coming and had held his shield well away fromhim. Meriones drew back under cover of his comrades, angry alike athaving failed to vanquish Deiphobus, and having broken his spear. Heturned therefore towards the ships and tents to fetch a spear which hehad left behind in his tent.

ííííThe others continued fighting, and the cry of battle rose up intothe heavens. Teucer son of Telamon was the first to kill his man, towit, the warrior Imbrius son of Mentor rich in horses. Until theAchaeans came he had lived in Pedaeum, and had married Medesicaste abastard daughter of Priam; but on the arrival of the Danaan fleet hehad gone back to Ilius, and was a great man among the Trojans,dwelling near Priam himself, who gave him like honour with his ownsons. The son of Telamon now struck him under the ear with a spearwhich he then drew back again, and Imbrius fell headlong as anash-tree when it is felled on the crest of some high mountainbeacon, and its delicate green foliage comes toppling down to theground. Thus did he fall with his bronze-dight armour ringingharshly round him, and Teucer sprang forward with intent to striphim of his armour; but as he was doing so, Hector took aim at him witha spear. Teucer saw the spear coming and swerved aside, whereon it hitAmphimachus, son of Cteatus son of Actor, in the chest as he wascoming into battle, and his armour rang rattling round him as hefell heavily to the ground. Hector sprang forward to takeAmphimachus's helmet from off his temples, and in a moment Ajaxthrew a spear at him, but did not wound him, for he was encased allover in his terrible armour; nevertheless the spear struck the boss ofhis shield with such force as to drive him back from the twocorpses, which the Achaeans then drew off. Stichius and Menestheus,captains of the Athenians, bore away Amphimachus to the host of theAchaeans, while the two brave and impetuous Ajaxes did the like byImbrius. As two lions snatch a goat from the hounds that have it intheir fangs, and bear it through thick brushwood high above the groundin their jaws, thus did the Ajaxes bear aloft the body of Imbrius, andstrip it of its armour. Then the son of Oileus severed the head fromthe neck in revenge for the death of Amphimachus, and sent it whirlingover the crowd as though it had been a ball, till fell in the dustat Hector's feet.

ííííNeptune was exceedingly angry that his grandson Amphimachus shouldhave fallen; he therefore went to the tents and ships of theAchaeans to urge the Danaans still further, and to devise evil for theTrojans. Idomeneus met him, as he was taking leave of a comrade, whohad just come to him from the fight, wounded in the knee. Hisfellow-soldiers bore him off the field, and Idomeneus having givenorders to the physicians went on to his tent, for he was stillthirsting for battle. Neptune spoke in the likeness and with the voiceof Thoas son of Andraemon who ruled the Aetolians of all Pleuron andhigh Calydon, and was honoured among his people as though he were agod. ""Idomeneus,"" said he, ""lawgiver to the Cretans, what has nowbecome of the threats with which the sons of the Achaeans used tothreaten the Trojans?""

ííííAnd Idomeneus chief among the Cretans answered, ""Thoas, no one, sofar as I know, is in fault, for we can all fight. None are held backneither by fear nor slackness, but it seems to be the of almighty Jovethat the Achaeans should perish ingloriously here far from Argos: you,Thoas, have been always staunch, and you keep others in heart if yousee any fail in duty; be not then remiss now, but exhort all to dotheir utmost.""

ííííTo this Neptune lord of the earthquake made answer, ""Idomeneus,may he never return from Troy, but remain here for dogs to battenupon, who is this day wilfully slack in fighting. Get your armourand go, we must make all haste together if we may be of any use,though we are only two. Even cowards gain courage fromcompanionship, and we two can hold our own with the bravest.""

ííííTherewith the god went back into the thick of the fight, andIdomeneus when he had reached his tent donned his armour, graspedhis two spears, and sallied forth. As the lightning which the son ofSaturn brandishes from bright Olympus when he would show a sign tomortals, and its gleam flashes far and wide- even so did his armourgleam about him as he ran. Meriones his sturdy squire met him while hewas still near his tent (for he was going to fetch his spear) andIdomeneus said

íííí""Meriones, fleet son of Molus, best of comrades, why have you leftthe field? Are you wounded, and is the point of the weapon hurtingyou? or have you been sent to fetch me? I want no fetching; I hadfar rather fight than stay in my tent.""

íííí""Idomeneus,"" answered Meriones, ""I come for a spear, if I can findone in my tent; I have broken the one I had, in throwing it at theshield of Deiphobus.""

ííííAnd Idomeneus captain of the Cretans answered, ""You will find onespear, or twenty if you so please, standing up against the end wall ofmy tent. I have taken them from Trojans whom I have killed, for I amnot one to keep my enemy at arm's length; therefore I have spears,bossed shields, helmets, and burnished corslets.""

ííííThen Meriones said, ""I too in my tent and at my ship have spoilstaken from the Trojans, but they are not at hand. I have been at alltimes valorous, and wherever there has been hard fighting have held myown among the foremost. There may be those among the Achaeans who donot know how I fight, but you know it well enough yourself.""

ííííIdomeneus answered, ""I know you for a brave man: you need not tellme. If the best men at the ships were being chosen to go on an ambush-and there is nothing like this for showing what a man is made of; itcomes out then who is cowardly and who brave; the coward will changecolour at every touch and turn; he is full of fears, and keepsshifting his weight first on one knee and then on the other; his heartbeats fast as he thinks of death, and one can hear the chattering ofhis teeth; whereas the brave man will not change colour nor be onfinding himself in ambush, but is all the time longing to go intoaction- if the best men were being chosen for such a service, no onecould make light of your courage nor feats of arms. If you were struckby a dart or smitten in close combat, it would not be from behind,in your neck nor back, but the weapon would hit you in the chest orbelly as you were pressing forward to a place in the front ranks.But let us no longer stay here talking like children, lest we be illspoken of; go, fetch your spear from the tent at once.""

ííííOn this Meriones, peer of Mars, went to the tent and got himself aspear of bronze. He then followed after Idomeneus, big with greatdeeds of valour. As when baneful Mars sallies forth to battle, and hisson Panic so strong and dauntless goes with him, to strike terror eveninto the heart of a hero- the pair have gone from Thrace to armthemselves among the Ephyri or the brave Phlegyans, but they willnot listen to both the contending hosts, and will give victory toone side or to the other- even so did Meriones and Idomeneus, captainsof men, go out to battle clad in their bronze armour. Meriones wasfirst to speak. ""Son of Deucalion,"" said he, ""where would you haveus begin fighting? On the right wing of the host, in the centre, or onthe left wing, where I take it the Achaeans will be weakest?""

ííííIdomeneus answered, ""There are others to defend the centre- thetwo Ajaxes and Teucer, who is the finest archer of all the Achaeans,and is good also in a hand-to-hand fight. These will give Hector sonof Priam enough to do; fight as he may, he will find it hard tovanquish their indomitable fury, and fire the ships, unless the son ofSaturn fling a firebrand upon them with his own hand. Great Ajax sonof Telamon will yield to no man who is in mortal mould and eats thegrain of Ceres, if bronze and great stones can overthrow him. He wouldnot yield even to Achilles in hand-to-hand fight, and in fleetnessof foot there is none to beat him; let us turn therefore towards theleft wing, that we may know forthwith whether we are to give gloryto some other, or he to us.""

ííííMeriones, peer of fleet Mars, then led the way till they came to thepart of the host which Idomeneus had named.

ííííNow when the Trojans saw Idomeneus coming on like a flame of fire,him and his squire clad in their richly wrought armour, they shoutedand made towards him all in a body, and a furious hand-to-hand fightraged under the ships' sterns. Fierce as the shrill winds that whistleupon a day when dust lies deep on the roads, and the gusts raise itinto a thick cloud- even such was the fury of the combat, and mightand main did they hack at each other with spear and sword throughoutthe host. The field bristled with the long and deadly spears whichthey bore. Dazzling was the sheen of their gleaming helmets, theirfresh-burnished breastplates, and glittering shields as they joinedbattle with one another. Iron indeed must be his courage who couldtake pleasure in the sight of such a turmoil, and look on it withoutbeing dismayed.

ííííThus did the two mighty sons of Saturn devise evil for mortalheroes. Jove was minded to give victory to the Trojans and toHector, so as to do honour to fleet Achilles, nevertheless he didnot mean to utterly overthrow the Achaean host before Ilius, andonly wanted to glorify Thetis and her valiant son. Neptune on theother hand went about among the Argives to incite them, having come upfrom the grey sea in secret, for he was grieved at seeing themvanquished by the Trojans, and was furiously angry with Jove. Bothwere of the same race and country, but Jove was elder born and knewmore, therefore Neptune feared to defend the Argives openly, but inthe likeness of man, he kept on encouraging them throughout theirhost. Thus, then, did these two devise a knot of war and battle,that none could unloose or break, and set both sides tugging at it, tothe failing of men's knees beneath them.

ííííAnd now Idomeneus, though his hair was already flecked with grey,called loud on the Danaans and spread panic among the Trojans as heleaped in among them. He slew Othryoneus from Cabesus, a sojourner,who had but lately come to take part in the war. He sought Cassandrathe fairest of Priam's daughters in marriage, but offered no giftsof wooing, for he promised a great thing, to wit, that he woulddrive the sons of the Achaeans willy nilly from Troy; old King Priamhad given his consent and promised her to him, whereon he fought onthe strength of the promises thus made to him. Idomeneus aimed aspear, and hit him as he came striding on. His cuirass of bronze didnot protect him, and the spear stuck in his belly, so that he fellheavily to the ground. Then Idomeneus vaunted over him saying,""Othryoneus, there is no one in the world whom I shall admire morethan I do you, if you indeed perform what you have promised Priamson of Dardanus in return for his daughter. We too will make you anoffer; we will give you the loveliest daughter of the son of Atreus,and will bring her from Argos for you to marry, if you will sack thegoodly city of Ilius in company with ourselves; so come along with me,that we may make a covenant at the ships about the marriage, and wewill not be hard upon you about gifts of wooing.""

ííííWith this Idomeneus began dragging him by the foot through the thickof the fight, but Asius came up to protect the body, on foot, in frontof his horses which his esquire drove so close behind him that hecould feel their 'breath upon his shoulder. He was longing to strikedown Idomeneus, but ere he could do so Idomeneus smote him with hisspear in the throat under the chin, and the bronze point went cleanthrough it. He fell as an oak, or poplar, or pine which shipwrightshave felled for ship's timber upon the mountains with whetted axes-even thus did he lie full length in front of his chariot and horses,grinding his teeth and clutching at the bloodstained just. Hischarioteer was struck with panic and did not dare turn his horsesround and escape: thereupon Antilochus hit him in the middle of hisbody with a spear; his cuirass of bronze did not protect him, andthe spear stuck in his belly. He fell gasping from his chariot andAntilochus great Nestor's son, drove his horses from the Trojans tothe Achaeans.

ííííDeiphobus then came close up to Idomeneus to avenge Asius, andtook aim at him with a spear, but Idomeneus was on the look-out andavoided it, for he was covered by the round shield he always bore- ashield of oxhide and bronze with two arm-rods on the inside. Hecrouched under cover of this, and the spear flew over him, but theshield rang out as the spear grazed it, and the weapon sped not invain from the strong hand of Deiphobus, for it struck Hypsenor sonof Hippasus, shepherd of his people, in the liver under the midriff,and his limbs failed beneath him. Deiphobus vaunted over him and criedwith a loud voice saying, ""Of a truth Asius has not fallenunavenied; he will be glad even while passing into the house of Hades,strong warden of the gate, that I have sent some one to escort him.""

ííííThus did he vaunt, and the Argives were stung by his saying. NobleAntilochus was more angry than any one, but grief did not make himforget his friend and comrade. He ran up to him, bestrode him, andcovered him with his shield; then two of his staunch comrades,Mecisteus son of Echius, and Alastor stooped down, and bore him awaygroaning heavily to the ships. But Idomeneus ceased not his fury. Hekept on striving continually either to enshroud some Trojan in thedarkness of death, or himself to fall while warding off the evil dayfrom the Achaeans. Then fell Alcathous son of noble Aesyetes: he wasson-in-law to Anchises, having married his eldest daughter Hippodameiawho was the darling of her father and mother, and excelled all hergeneration in beauty, accomplishments, and understanding, whereforethe bravest man in all Troy had taken her to wife- him did Neptune laylow by the hand of Idomeneus, blinding his bright eyes and binding hisstrong limbs in fetters so that he could neither go back nor to oneside, but stood stock still like pillar or lofty tree when Idomeneusstruck him with a spear in the middle of his chest. The coat of mailthat had hitherto protected his body was now broken, and rangharshly as the spear tore through it. He fell heavily to the ground,and the spear stuck in his heart, which still beat, and made thebutt-end of the spear quiver till dread Mars put an end to his life.Idomeneus vaunted over him and cried with a loud voice saying,""Deiphobus, since you are in a mood to vaunt, shall we cry quits nowthat we have killed three men to your one? Nay, sir, stand in fightwith me yourself, that you may learn what manner of Jove-begottenman am I that have come hither. Jove first begot Minos chief rulerin Crete, and Minos in his turn begot a son, noble Deucalion;Deucalion begot me to be a ruler over many men in Crete, and myships have now brought me hither, to be the bane of yourself, yourfather, and the Trojans.""

ííííThus did he speak, and Deiphobus was in two minds, whether to goback and fetch some other Trojan to help him, or to take up thechallenge single-handed. In the end, he deemed it best to go and fetchAeneas, whom he found standing in the rear, for he had long beenaggrieved with Priam because in spite his brave deeds he did notgive him his due share of honour. Deiphobus went up to him and said,""Aeneas, prince among the Trojans, if you know any ties of kinship,help me now to defend the body of your sister's husband; come withme to the rescue of Alcathous, who being husband to your sisterbrought you up when you were a child in his house, and now Idomeneushas slain him.""

ííííWith these words he moved the heart of Aeneas, and he went inpursuit of Idomeneus, big with great deeds of valour; but Idomeneuswas not to be thus daunted as though he were a mere child; he held hisground as a wild boar at bay upon the mountains, who abides the comingof a great crowd of men in some lonely place- the bristles standupright on his back, his eyes flash fire, and he whets his tusks inhis eagerness to defend himself against hounds and men- even so didfamed Idomeneus hold his ground and budge not at the coming of Aeneas.He cried aloud to his comrades looking towards Ascalaphus, Aphareus,Deipyrus, Meriones, and Antilochus, all of them brave soldiers-""Hither my friends,"" he cried, ""and leave me not single-handed- I goin great fear by fleet Aeneas, who is coming against me, and is aredoubtable dispenser of death battle. Moreover he is in the flower ofyouth when a man's strength is greatest; if I was of the same age ashe is and in my present mind, either he or I should soon bear away theprize of victory

ííííOn this, all of them as one man stood near him, shield onshoulder. Aeneas on the other side called to his comrades, lookingtowards Deiphobus, Paris, and Agenor, who were leaders of theTrojans along with himself, and the people followed them as sheepfollow the ram when they go down to drink after they have beenfeeding, and the heart of the shepherd is glad- even so was theheart of Aeneas gladdened when he saw his people follow him.

ííííThen they fought furiously in close combat about the body ofAlcathous, wielding their long spears; and the bronze armour abouttheir bodies rang fearfully as they took aim at one another in thepress of the fight, while the two heroes Aeneas and Idomeneus, peersof Mars, outxied every one in their desire to hack at each otherwith sword and spear. Aeneas took aim first, but Idomeneus was onthe lookout and avoided the spear, so that it sped from Aeneas' stronghand in vain, and fell quivering in the ground. Idomeneus meanwhilesmote Oenomaus in the middle of his belly, and broke the plate ofhis corslet, whereon his bowels came gushing out and he clutched theearth in the palms of his hands as he fell sprawling in the dust.Idomeneus drew his spear out of the body, but could not strip him ofthe rest of his armour for the rain of darts that were showered uponhim: moreover his strength was now beginning to fail him so that hecould no longer charge, and could neither spring forward to recoverhis own weapon nor swerve aside to avoid one that was aimed at him;therefore, though he still defended himself in hand-to-hand fight, hisheavy feet could not bear him swiftly out of the battle. Deiphobusaimed a spear at him as he was retreating slowly from the field, forhis bitterness against him was as fierce as ever, but again hemissed him, and hit Ascalaphus, the son of Mars; the spear wentthrough his shoulder, and he clutched the earth in the palms of hishands as he fell sprawling in the dust.

ííííGrim Mars of awful voice did not yet know that his son had fallen,for he was sitting on the summits of Olympus under the goldenclouds, by command of Jove, where the other gods were also sitting,forbidden to take part in the battle. Meanwhile men fought furiouslyabout the body. Deiphobus tore the helmet from off his head, butMeriones sprang upon him, and struck him on the arm with a spear sothat the visored helmet fell from his hand and came ringing downupon the ground. Thereon Meriones sprang upon him like a vulture, drewthe spear from his shoulder, and fell back under cover of his men.Then Polites, own brother of Deiphobus passed his arms around hiswaist, and bore him away from the battle till he got to his horsesthat were standing in the rear of the fight with the chariot and theirdriver. These took him towards the city groaning and in great pain,with the blood flowing from his arm.

ííííThe others still fought on, and the battle-cry rose to heavenwithout ceasing. Aeneas sprang on Aphareus son of Caletor, andstruck him with a spear in his throat which was turned towards him;his head fell on one side, his helmet and shield came down alongwith him, and death, life's foe, was shed around him. Antilochus spiedhis chance, flew forward towards Thoon, and wounded him as he wasturning round. He laid open the vein that runs all the way up the backto the neck; he cut this vein clean away throughout its wholecourse, and Thoon fell in the dust face upwards, stretching out hishands imploringly towards his comrades. Antilochus sprang upon him andstripped the armour from his shoulders, glaring round him fearfully ashe did so. The Trojans came about him on every side and struck hisbroad and gleaming shield, but could not wound his body, for Neptunestood guard over the son of Nestor, though the darts fell thicklyround him. He was never clear of the foe, but was always in thethick of the fight; his spear was never idle; he poised and aimed itin every direction, so eager was he to hit some one from a distance orto fight him hand to hand.

ííííAs he was thus aiming among the crowd, he was seen by Adamas sonof Asius, who rushed towards him and struck him with a spear in themiddle of his shield, but Neptune made its point without effect, forhe grudged him the life of Antilochus. One half, therefore, of thespear stuck fast like a charred stake in Antilochus's shield, whilethe other lay on the ground. Adamas then sought shelter under cover ofhis men, but Meriones followed after and hit him with a spear midwaybetween the private parts and the navel, where a wound is particualrlypainful to wretched mortals. There did Meriones transfix him, and hewrithed convulsively about the spear as some bull whom mountainherdsmen have bound with ropes of withes and are taking away perforce.Even so did he move convulsively for a while, but not for very long,till Meriones came up and drew the spear out of his body, and his eyeswere veiled in darkness.

ííííHelenus then struck Deipyrus with a great Thracian sword, hittinghim on the temple in close combat and tearing the helmet from hishead; the helmet fell to the ground, and one of those who werefighting on the Achaean side took charge of it as it rolled at hisfeet, but the eyes of Deipyrus were closed in the darkness of death.

ííííOn this Menelaus was grieved, and made menacingly towards Helenus,brandishing his spear; but Helenus drew his bow, and the twoattacked one another at one and the same moment, the one with hisspear, and the other with his bow and arrow. The son of Priam hitthe breastplate of Menelaus's corslet, but the arrow glanced fromoff it. As black beans or pulse come pattering down on to athreshing-floor from the broad winnowing-shovel, blown by shrill windsand shaken by the shovel- even so did the arrow glance off andrecoil from the shield of Menelaus, who in his turn wounded the handwith which Helenus carried his bow; the spear went right through hishand and stuck in the bow itself, so that to his life he retreatedunder cover of his men, with his hand dragging by his side- for thespear weighed it down till Agenor drew it out and bound the handcarefully up in a woollen sling which his esquire had with him.

ííííPisander then made straight at Menelaus- his evil destiny luring himon to his doom, for he was to fall in fight with you, O Menelaus. Whenthe two were hard by one another the spear of the son of Atreus turnedaside and he missed his aim; Pisander then struck the shield ofbrave Menelaus but could not pierce it, for the shield stayed thespear and broke the shaft; nevertheless he was glad and made sure ofvictory; forthwith, however, the son of Atreus drew his sword andsprang upon him. Pisander then seized the bronze battle-axe, withits long and polished handle of olive wood that hung by his side underhis shield, and the two made at one another. Pisander struck thepeak of Menelaus's crested helmet just under the crest itself, andMenelaus hit Pisander as he was coming towards him, on the forehead,just at the rise of his nose; the bones cracked and his twogore-bedrabbled eyes fell by his feet in the dust. He fell backwardsto the ground, and Menelaus set his heel upon him, stripped him of hisarmour, and vaunted over him saying, ""Even thus shall you Trojansleave the ships of the Achaeans, proud and insatiate of battlethough you be: nor shall you lack any of the disgrace and shamewhich you have heaped upon myself. Cowardly she-wolves that you are,you feared not the anger of dread Jove, avenger of violatedhospitality, who will one day destroy your city; you stole my weddedwife and wickedly carried off much treasure when you were her guest,and now you would fling fire upon our ships, and kill our heroes. Aday will come when, rage as you may, you shall be stayed. O fatherJove, you, who they say art above all both gods and men in wisdom, andfrom whom all things that befall us do proceed, how can you thusfavour the Trojans- men so proud and overweening, that they arenever tired of fighting? All things pall after a while- sleep, love,sweet song, and stately dance- still these are things of which a manwould surely have his fill rather than of battle, whereas it is ofbattle that the Trojans are insatiate.""

ííííSo saying Menelaus stripped the blood-stained armour from the bodyof Pisander, and handed it over to his men; then he again rangedhimself among those who were in the front of the fight.

ííííHarpalion son of King Pylaemenes then sprang upon him; he had cometo fight at Troy along with his father, but he did not go homeagain. He struck the middle of Menelaus's shield with his spear butcould not pierce it, and to save his life drew back under cover of hismen, looking round him on every side lest he should be wounded. ButMeriones aimed a bronze-tipped arrow at him as he was leaving thefield, and hit him on the right buttock; the arrow pierced the bonethrough and through, and penetrated the bladder, so he sat downwhere he was and breathed his last in the arms of his comrades,stretched like a worm upon the ground and watering the earth withthe blood that flowed from his wound. The brave Paphlagonians tendedhim with all due care; they raised him into his chariot, and borehim sadly off to the city of Troy; his father went also with himweeping bitterly, but there was no ransom that could bring his deadson to life again.

ííííParis was deeply grieved by the death of Harpalion, who was his hostwhen he went among the Paphlagonians; he aimed an arrow, therefore, inorder to avenge him. Now there was a certain man named Euchenor, sonof Polyidus the prophet, a brave man and wealthy, whose home was inCorinth. This Euchenor had set sail for Troy well knowing that itwould be the death of him, for his good old father Polyidus hadoften told him that he must either stay at home and die of aterrible disease, or go with the Achaeans and perish at the hands ofthe Trojans; he chose, therefore, to avoid incurring the heavy finethe Achaeans would have laid upon him, and at the same time toescape the pain and suffering of disease. Paris now smote him on thejaw under his ear, whereon the life went out of him and he wasenshrouded in the darkness of death.

ííííThus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. But Hector hadnot yet heard, and did not know that the Argives were making havocof his men on the left wing of the battle, where the Achaeans ere longwould have triumphed over them, so vigorously did Neptune cheer themon and help them. He therefore held on at the point where he had firstforced his way through the gates and the wall, after breakingthrough the serried ranks of Danaan warriors. It was here that theships of Ajax and Protesilaus were drawn up by the sea-shore; here thewall was at its lowest, and the fight both of man and horse raged mostfiercely. The Boeotians and the Ionians with their long tunics, theLocrians, the men of Phthia, and the famous force of the Epeanscould hardly stay Hector as he rushed on towards the ships, norcould they drive him from them, for he was as a wall of fire. Thechosen men of the Athenians were in the van, led by Menestheus sonof Peteos, with whom were also Pheidas, Stichius, and stalwart Bias:Meges son of Phyleus, Amphion, and Dracius commanded the Epeans, whileMedon and staunch Podarces led the men of Phthia. Of these, Medonwas bastard son to Oileus and brother of Ajax, but he lived in Phylaceaway from his own country, for he had killed the brother of hisstepmother Eriopis, the wife of Oileus; the other, Podarces, was theson of Iphiclus son of Phylacus. These two stood in the van of thePhthians, and defended the ships along with the Boeotians.

ííííAjax son of Oileus never for a moment left the side of Ajax son ofTelamon, but as two swart oxen both strain their utmost at theplough which they are drawing in a fallow field, and the sweatsteams upwards from about the roots of their horns- nothing but theyoke divides them as they break up the ground till they reach theend of the field- even so did the two Ajaxes stand shoulder toshoulder by one another. Many and brave comrades followed the son ofTelamon, to relieve him of his shield when he was overcome withsweat and toil, but the Locrians did not follow so close after the sonof Oileus, for they could not hold their own in a hand-to-handfight. They had no bronze helmets with plumes of horse-hair, neitherhad they shields nor ashen spears, but they had come to Troy armedwith bows, and with slings of twisted wool from which they showeredtheir missiles to break the ranks of the Trojans. The others,therefore, with their heavy armour bore the brunt of the fight withthe Trojans and with Hector, while the Locrians shot from behind,under their cover; and thus the Trojans began to lose heart, for thearrows threw them into confusion.

ííííThe Trojans would now have been driven in sorry plight from theships and tents back to windy Ilius, had not Polydamas presentlysaid to Hector, ""Hector, there is no persuading you to take advice.Because heaven has so richly endowed you with the arts of war, youthink that you must therefore excel others in counsel; but youcannot thus claim preeminence in all things. Heaven has made one manan excellent soldier; of another it has made a dancer or a singerand player on the lyre; while yet in another Jove has implanted a wiseunderstanding of which men reap fruit to the saving of many, and hehimself knows more about it than any one; therefore I will say whatI think will be best. The fight has hemmed you in as with a circleof fire, and even now that the Trojans are within the wall some ofthem stand aloof in full armour, while others are fighting scatteredand outnumbered near the ships. Draw back, therefore, and call yourchieftains round you, that we may advise together whether to fallnow upon the ships in the hope that heaven may vouchsafe us victory,or to beat a retreat while we can yet safely do so. I greatly fearthat the Achaeans will pay us their debt of yesterday in full, forthere is one abiding at their ships who is never weary of battle,and who will not hold aloof much longer.""

ííííThus spoke Polydamas, and his words pleased Hector well. He sprangin full armour from his chariot and said, ""Polydamas, gather thechieftains here; I will go yonder into the fight, but will return atonce when I have given them their orders.""

ííííHe then sped onward, towering like a snowy mountain, and with a loudcry flew through the ranks of the Trojans and their allies. Whenthey heard his voice they all hastened to gather round Polydamas theexcellent son of Panthous, but Hector kept on among the foremost,looking everywhere to find Deiphobus and prince Helenus, Adamas son ofAsius, and Asius son of Hyrtacus; living, indeed, and scatheless hecould no longer find them, for the two last were lying by the sternsof the Achaean ships, slain by the Argives, while the others hadbeen also stricken and wounded by them; but upon the left wing ofthe dread battle he found Alexandrus, husband of lovely Helen,cheering his men and urging them on to fight. He went up to him andupbraided him. ""Paris,"" said he, ""evil-hearted Paris, fair to seebut woman-mad and false of tongue, where are Deiphobus and KingHelenus? Where are Adamas son of Asius, and Asius son of Hyrtacus?Where too is Othryoneus? Ilius is undone and will now surely fall!""

ííííAlexandrus answered, ""Hector, why find fault when there is no one tofind fault with? I should hold aloof from battle on any day ratherthan this, for my mother bore me with nothing of the coward aboutme. From the moment when you set our men fighting about the ships wehave been staying here and doing battle with the Danaans. Our comradesabout whom you ask me are dead; Deiphobus and King Helenus alonehave left the field, wounded both of them in the hand, but the sonof Saturn saved them alive. Now, therefore, lead on where you wouldhave us go, and we will follow with right goodwill; you shall not findus fail you in so far as our strength holds out, but no man can domore than in him lies, no matter how willing he may be.""

ííííWith these words he satisfied his brother, and the two wenttowards the part of the battle where the fight was thickest, aboutCebriones, brave Polydamas, Phalces, Orthaeus, godlike Polyphetes,Palmys, Ascanius, and Morys son of Hippotion, who had come fromfertile Ascania on the preceding day to relieve other troops. ThenJove urged them on to fight. They flew forth like the blasts of somefierce wind that strike earth in the van of a thunderstorm- theybuffet the salt sea into an uproar; many and mighty are the greatwaves that come crashing in one after the other upon the shore withtheir arching heads all crested with foam- even so did rank behindrank of Trojans arrayed in gleaming armour follow their leadersonward. The way was led by Hector son of Priam, peer of murderousMars, with his round shield before him- his shield of ox-hides coveredwith plates of bronze- and his gleaming helmet upon his temples. Hekept stepping forward under cover of his shield in every direction,making trial of the ranks to see if they would give way be him, but hecould not daunt the courage of the Achaeans. Ajax was the first tostride out and challenge him. ""Sir,"" he cried, ""draw near; why doyou think thus vainly to dismay the Argives? We Achaeans are excellentsoldiers, but the scourge of Jove has fallen heavily upon us. Yourheart, forsooth, is set on destroying our ships, but we too have bandsthat can keep you at bay, and your own fair town shall be sooner takenand sacked by ourselves. The time is near when you shall pray Jove andall the gods in your flight, that your steeds may be swifter thanhawks as they raise the dust on the plain and bear you back to yourcity.""

ííííAs he was thus speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand, andthe host of the Achaeans shouted, for they took heart at the omen. ButHector answered, ""Ajax, braggart and false of tongue, would that Iwere as sure of being son for evermore to aegis-bearing Jove, withQueen Juno for my mother, and of being held in like honour withMinerva and Apollo, as I am that this day is big with thedestruction of the Achaeans; and you shall fall among them if you dareabide my spear; it shall rend your fair body and bid you glut ourhounds and birds of prey with your fat and your flesh, as you fallby the ships of the Achaeans.""

ííííWith these words he led the way and the others followed after with acry that rent the air, while the host shouted behind them. The Argiveson their part raised a shout likewise, nor did they forget theirprowess, but stood firm against the onslaught of the Trojanchieftains, and the cry from both the hosts rose up to heaven and tothe brightness of Jove's presence.

ííííBOOK XIV

ííííNESTOR was sitting over his wine, but the cry of battle did notescape him, and he said to the son of Aesculapius, ""What, nobleMachaon, is the meaning of all this? The shouts of men fighting by ourships grow stronger and stronger; stay here, therefore, and sit overyour wine, while fair Hecamede heats you a bath and washes the clottedblood from off you. I will go at once to the look-out station andsee what it is all about.""

ííííAs he spoke he took up the shield of his son Thrasymedes that waslying in his tent, all gleaming with bronze, for Thrasymedes had takenhis father's shield; he grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear, andas soon as he was outside saw the disastrous rout of the Achaeans who,now that their wall was overthrown, were flying pell-mell before theTrojans. As when there is a heavy swell upon the sea, but the wavesare dumb- they keep their eyes on the watch for the quarter whence thefierce winds may spring upon them, but they stay where they are andset neither this way nor that, till some particular wind sweeps downfrom heaven to determine them- even so did the old man ponderwhether to make for the crowd of Danaans, or go in search ofAgamemnon. In the end he deemed it best to go to the son of Atreus;but meanwhile the hosts were fighting and killing one another, and thehard bronze rattled on their bodies, as they thrust at one anotherwith their swords and spears.

ííííThe wounded kings, the son of Tydeus, Ulysses, and Agamemnon sonof Atreus, fell in Nestor as they were coming up from their ships- fortheirs were drawn up some way from where the fighting was going on,being on the shore itself inasmuch as they had been beached first,while the wall had been built behind the hindermost. The stretch ofthe shore, wide though it was, did not afford room for all theships, and the host was cramped for space, therefore they had placedthe ships in rows one behind the other, and had filled the wholeopening of the bay between the two points that formed it. The kings,leaning on their spears, were coming out to survey the fight, being ingreat anxiety, and when old Nestor met them they were filled withdismay. Then King Agamemnon said to him, ""Nestor son of Neleus, honourto the Achaean name, why have you left the battle to come hither? Ifear that what dread Hector said will come true, when he vaunted amongthe Trojans saying that he would not return to Ilius till he had firedour ships and killed us; this is what he said, and now it is allcoming true. Alas! others of the Achaeans, like Achilles, are in angerwith me that they refuse to fight by the sterns of our ships.""

ííííThen Nestor knight of Gerene answered, ""It is indeed as you say;it is all coming true at this moment, and even Jove who thundersfrom on high cannot prevent it. Fallen is the wall on which werelied as an impregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet. TheTrojans are fighting stubbornly and without ceasing at the ships; lookwhere you may you cannot see from what quarter the rout of theAchaeans is coming; they are being killed in a confused mass and thebattle-cry ascends to heaven; let us think, if counsel can be of anyuse, what we had better do; but I do not advise our going intobattle ourselves, for a man cannot fight when he is wounded.""

ííííAnd King Agamemnon answered, ""Nestor, if the Trojans are indeedfighting at the rear of our ships, and neither the wall nor the trenchhas served us- over which the Danaans toiled so hard, and which theydeemed would be an impregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet- Isee it must be the will of Jove that the Achaeans should perishingloriously here, far from Argos. I knew when Jove was willing todefend us, and I know now that he is raising the Trojans to likehonour with the gods, while us, on the other hand, he bas bound handand foot. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say; let us bring downthe ships that are on the beach and draw them into the water; let usmake them fast to their mooring-stones a little way out, against thefall of night- if even by night the Trojans will desist from fighting;we may then draw down the rest of the fleet. There is nothing wrong inflying ruin even by night. It is better for a man that he should flyand be saved than be caught and killed.""

ííííUlysses looked fiercely at him and said, ""Son of Atreus, what areyou talking about? Wretch, you should have commanded some other andbaser army, and not been ruler over us to whom Jove has allotted alife of hard fighting from youth to old age, till we every one of usperish. Is it thus that you would quit the city of Troy, to winwhich we have suffered so much hardship? Hold your peace, lest someother of the Achaeans hear you say what no man who knows how to givegood counsel, no king over so great a host as that of the Argivesshould ever have let fall from his lips. I despise your judgementutterly for what you have been saying. Would you, then, have us drawdown our ships into the water while the battle is raging, and thusplay further into the hands of the conquering Trojans? It would beruin; the Achaeans will not go on fighting when they see the shipsbeing drawn into the water, but will cease attacking and keepturning their eyes towards them; your counsel, therefore, Sir captain,would be our destruction.""

ííííAgamemnon answered, ""Ulysses, your rebuke has stung me to the heart.I am not, however, ordering the Achaeans to draw their ships intothe sea whether they will or no. Some one, it may be, old or young,can offer us better counsel which I shall rejoice to hear.""

ííííThen said Diomed, ""Such an one is at hand; he is not far to seek, ifyou will listen to me and not resent my speaking though I am youngerthan any of you. I am by lineage son to a noble sire, Tydeus, who liesburied at Thebes. For Portheus had three noble sons, two of whom,Agrius and Melas, abode in Pleuron and rocky Calydon. The third wasthe knight Oeneus, my father's father, and he was the most valiantof them all. Oeeneus remained in his own country, but my father (asJove and the other gods ordained it) migrated to Argos. He marriedinto the family of Adrastus, and his house was one of great abundance,for he had large estates of rich corn-growing land, with muchorchard ground as well, and he had many sheep; moreover he excelledall the Argives in the use of the spear. You must yourselves haveheard whether these things are true or no; therefore when I say welldespise not my words as though I were a coward or of ignoble birth.I say, then, let us go to the fight as we needs must, wounded thoughwe be. When there, we may keep out of the battle and beyond therange of the spears lest we get fresh wounds in addition to what wehave already, but we can spur on others, who have been indulging theirspleen and holding aloof from battle hitherto.""

ííííThus did he speak; whereon they did even as he had said and set out,King Agamemnon leading the way.

ííííMeanwhile Neptune had kept no blind look-out, and came up to them inthe semblance of an old man. He took Agamemnon's right hand in his ownand said, ""Son of Atreus, I take it Achilles is glad now that hesees the Achaeans routed and slain, for he is utterly without remorse-may he come to a bad end and heaven confound him. As for yourself, theblessed gods are not yet so bitterly angry with you but that theprinces and counsellors of the Trojans shall again raise the dust uponthe plain, and you shall see them flying from the ships and tentstowards their city.""

ííííWith this he raised a mighty cry of battle, and sped forward tothe plain. The voice that came from his deep chest was as that of nineor ten thousand men when they are shouting in the thick of a fight,and it put fresh courage into the hearts of the Achaeans to wage warand do battle without ceasing.

ííííJuno of the golden throne looked down as she stood upon a peak ofOlympus and her heart was gladdened at the sight of him who was atonce her brother and her brother-in-law, hurrying hither and thitheramid the fighting. Then she turned her eyes to Jove as he sat on thetopmost crests of many-fountained Ida, and loathed him. She setherself to think how she might hoodwink him, and in the end she deemedthat it would be best for her to go to Ida and array herself in richattire, in the hope that Jove might become enamoured of her, andwish to embrace her. While he was thus engaged a sweet and carelesssleep might be made to steal over his eyes and senses.

ííííShe went, therefore, to the room which her son Vulcan had madeher, and the doors of which he had cunningly fastened by means of asecret key so that no other god could open them. Here she enteredand closed the doors behind her. She cleansed all the dirt from herfair body with ambrosia, then she anointed herself with olive oil,ambrosial, very soft, and scented specially for herself- if it were somuch as shaken in the bronze-floored house of Jove, the scent pervadedthe universe of heaven and earth. With this she anointed herdelicate skin, and then she plaited the fair ambrosial locks thatflowed in a stream of golden tresses from her immortal head. She puton the wondrous robe which Minerva had worked for her withconsummate art, and had embroidered with manifold devices; shefastened it about her bosom with golden clasps, and she girded herselfwith a girdle that had a hundred tassels: then she fastened herearrings, three brilliant pendants that glistened most beautifully,through the pierced lobes of her ears, and threw a lovely new veilover her head. She bound her sandals on to her feet, and when shehad arrayed herself perfectly to her satisfaction, she left her roomand called Venus to come aside and speak to her. ""My dear child,"" saidshe, ""will you do what I am going to ask of you, or will refuse mebecause you are angry at my being on the Danaan side, while you are onthe Trojan?""

ííííJove's daughter Venus answered, ""Juno, august queen of goddesses,daughter of mighty Saturn, say what you want, and I will do it forat once, if I can, and if it can be done at all.""

ííííThen Juno told her a lying tale and said, ""I want you to endow mewith some of those fascinating charms, the spells of which bring allthings mortal and immortal to your feet. I am going to the world's endto visit Oceanus (from whom all we gods proceed) and mother Tethys:they received me in their house, took care of me, and brought me up,having taken me over from Rhaea when Jove imprisoned great Saturn inthe depths that are under earth and sea. I must go and see them that Imay make peace between them; they have been quarrelling, and are soangry that they have not slept with one another this long while; ifI can bring them round and restore them to one another's embraces,they will be grateful to me and love me for ever afterwards.""

ííííThereon laughter-loving Venus said, ""I cannot and must not refuseyou, for you sleep in the arms of Jove who is our king.""

ííííAs she spoke she loosed from her bosom the curiously embroideredgirdle into which all her charms had been wrought- love, desire, andthat sweet flattery which steals the judgement even of the mostprudent. She gave the girdle to Juno and said, ""Take this girdlewherein all my charms reside and lay it in your bosom. If you willwear it I promise you that your errand, be it what it may, will not bebootless.""

ííííWhen she heard this Juno smiled, and still smiling she laid thegirdle in her bosom.

ííííVenus now went back into the house of Jove, while Juno darted downfrom the summits of Olympus. She passed over Pieria and fairEmathia, and went on and on till she came to the snowy ranges of theThracian horsemen, over whose topmost crests she sped without eversetting foot to ground. When she came to Athos she went on over the,waves of the sea till she reached Lemnos, the city of noble Thoas.There she met Sleep, own brother to Death, and caught him by the hand,saying, ""Sleep, you who lord it alike over mortals and immortals, ifyou ever did me a service in times past, do one for me now, and Ishall be grateful to you ever after. Close Jove's keen eyes for mein slumber while I hold him clasped in my embrace, and I will give youa beautiful golden seat, that can never fall to pieces; myclubfooted son Vulcan shall make it for you, and he shall give it afootstool for you to rest your fair feet upon when you are at table.""

ííííThen Sleep answered, ""Juno, great queen of goddesses, daughter ofmighty Saturn, I would lull any other of the gods to sleep withoutcompunction, not even excepting the waters of Oceanus from whom all ofthem proceed, but I dare not go near Jove, nor send him to sleepunless he bids me. I have had one lesson already through doing whatyou asked me, on the day when Jove's mighty son Hercules set sail fromIlius after having sacked the city of the Trojans. At your bidding Isuffused my sweet self over the mind of aegis-bearing Jove, and laidhim to rest; meanwhile you hatched a plot against Hercules, and setthe blasts of the angry winds beating upon the sea, till you tookhim to the goodly city of Cos away from all his friends. Jove wasfurious when he awoke, and began hurling the gods about all over thehouse; he was looking more particularly for myself, and would haveflung me down through space into the sea where I should never havebeen heard of any more, had not Night who cows both men and godsprotected me. I fled to her and Jove left off looking for me inspite of his being so angry, for he did not dare do anything todisplease Night. And now you are again asking me to do something onwhich I cannot venture.""

ííííAnd Juno said, ""Sleep, why do you take such notions as those intoyour head? Do you think Jove will be as anxious to help the Trojans,as he was about his own son? Come, I will marry you to one of theyoungest of the Graces, and she shall be your own- Pasithea, whomyou have always wanted to marry.""

ííííSleep was pleased when he heard this, and answered, ""Then swear itto me by the dread waters of the river Styx; lay one hand on thebounteous earth, and the other on the sheen of the sea, so that allthe gods who dwell down below with Saturn may be our witnesses, andsee that you really do give me one of the youngest of the Graces-Pasithea, whom I have always wanted to marry.""

ííííJuno did as he had said. She swore, and invoked all the gods ofthe nether world, who are called Titans, to witness. When she hadcompleted her oath, the two enshrouded themselves in a thick mistand sped lightly forward, leaving Lemnos and Imbrus behind them.Presently they reached many-fountained Ida, mother of wild beasts, andLectum where they left the sea to go on by land, and the tops of thetrees of the forest soughed under the going of their feet. HereSleep halted, and ere Jove caught sight of him he climbed a loftypine-tree- the tallest that reared its head towards heaven on all Ida.He hid himself behind the branches and sat there in the semblance ofthe sweet-singing bird that haunts the mountains and is called Chalcisby the gods, but men call it Cymindis. Juno then went to Gargarus, thetopmost peak of Ida, and Jove, driver of the clouds, set eyes uponher. As soon as he did so he became inflamed with the samepassionate desire for her that he had felt when they had first enjoyedeach other's embraces, and slept with one another without their dearparents knowing anything about it. He went up to her and said, ""Whatdo you want that you have come hither from Olympus- and that toowith neither chariot nor horses to convey you?""

ííííThen Juno told him a lying tale and said, ""I am going to the world'send, to visit Oceanus, from whom all we gods proceed, and motherTethys; they received me into their house, took care of me, andbrought me up. I must go and see them that I may make peace betweenthem: they have been quarrelling, and are so angry that they havenot slept with one another this long time. The horses that will takeme over land and sea are stationed on the lowermost spurs ofmany-fountained Ida, and I have come here from Olympus on purpose toconsult you. I was afraid you might be angry with me later on, if Iwent to the house of Oceanus without letting you know.""

ííííAnd Jove said, ""Juno, you can choose some other time for paying yourvisit to Oceanus- for the present let us devote ourselves to loveand to the enjoyment of one another. Never yet have I been sooverpowered by passion neither for goddess nor mortal woman as I am atthis moment for yourself- not even when I was in love with the wife ofIxion who bore me Pirithous, peer of gods in counsel, nor yet withDanae the daintily-ancled daughter of Acrisius, who bore me thefamed hero Perseus. Then there was the daughter of Phoenix, who boreme Minos and Rhadamanthus: there was Semele, and Alcmena in Thebesby whom I begot my lion-hearted son Hercules, while Semele becamemother to Bacchus the comforter of mankind. There was queen Ceresagain, and lovely Leto, and yourself- but with none of these was Iever so much enamoured as I now am with you.""

ííííJuno again answered him with a lying tale. ""Most dread son ofSaturn,"" she exclaimed, ""what are you talking about? Would you have usenjoy one another here on the top of Mount Ida, where everything canbe seen? What if one of the ever-living gods should see us sleepingtogether, and tell the others? It would be such a scandal that whenI had risen from your embraces I could never show myself inside yourhouse again; but if you are so minded, there is a room which yourson Vulcan has made me, and he has given it good strong doors; ifyou would so have it, let us go thither and lie down.""

ííííAnd Jove answered, ""Juno, you need not be afraid that either godor man will see you, for I will enshroud both of us in such a densegolden cloud, that the very sun for all his bright piercing beamsshall not see through it.""

ííííWith this the son of Saturn caught his wife in his embrace;whereon the earth sprouted them a cushion of young grass, withdew-bespangled lotus, crocus, and hyacinth, so soft and thick thatit raised them well above the ground. Here they laid themselves downand overhead they were covered by a fair cloud of gold, from whichthere fell glittering dew-drops.

ííííThus, then, did the sire of all things repose peacefully on thecrest of Ida, overcome at once by sleep and love, and he held hisspouse in his arms. Meanwhile Sleep made off to the ships of theAchaeans, to tell earth-encircling Neptune, lord of the earthquake.When he had found him he said, ""Now, Neptune, you can help the Danaanswith a will, and give them victory though it be only for a shorttime while Jove is still sleeping. I have sent him into a sweetslumber, and Juno has beguiled him into going to bed with her.""

ííííSleep now departed and went his ways to and fro among mankind,leaving Neptune more eager than ever to help the Danaans. He dartedforward among the first ranks and shouted saying, ""Argives, shall welet Hector son of Priam have the triumph of taking our ships andcovering himself with glory? This is what he says that he shall nowdo, seeing that Achilles is still in dudgeon at his ship; We shall geton very well without him if we keep each other in heart and stand byone another. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say. Let us eachtake the best and largest shield we can lay hold of, put on ourhelmets, and sally forth with our longest spears in our hands; willlead you on, and Hector son of Priam, rage as he may, will not dare tohold out against us. If any good staunch soldier has only a smallshield, let him hand it over to a worse man, and take a larger one forhimself.""

ííííThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. The son ofTydeus, Ulysses, and Agamemnon, wounded though they were, set theothers in array, and went about everywhere effecting the exchangesof armour; the most valiant took the best armour, and gave the worseto the worse man. When they had donned their bronze armour theymarched on with Neptune at their head. In his strong hand he graspedhis terrible sword, keen of edge and flashing like lightning; woe tohim who comes across it in the day of battle; all men quake for fearand keep away from it.

ííííHector on the other side set the Trojans in array. Thereon Neptuneand Hector waged fierce war on one another- Hector on the Trojan andNeptune on the Argive side. Mighty was the uproar as the two forcesmet; the sea came rolling in towards the ships and tents of theAchaeans, but waves do not thunder on the shore more loudly whendriven before the blast of Boreas, nor do the flames of a forestfire roar more fiercely when it is well alight upon the mountains, nordoes the wind bellow with ruder music as it tears on through thetops of when it is blowing its hardest, than the terrible shoutwhich the Trojans and Achaeans raised as they sprang upon one another.

ííííHector first aimed his spear at Ajax, who was turned full towardshim, nor did he miss his aim. The spear struck him where two bandspassed over his chest- the band of his shield and that of hissilver-studded sword- and these protected his body. Hector was angrythat his spear should have been hurled in vain, and withdrew undercover of his men. As he was thus retreating, Ajax son of Telamonstruck him with a stone, of which there were many lying about underthe men's feet as they fought- brought there to give support to theships' sides as they lay on the shore. Ajax caught up one of themand struck Hector above the rim of his shield close to his neck; theblow made him spin round like a top and reel in all directions. Asan oak falls headlong when uprooted by the lightning flash of fatherJove, and there is a terrible smell of brimstone- no man can helpbeing dismayed if he is standing near it, for a thunderbolt is avery awful thing- even so did Hector fall to earth and bite thedust. His spear fell from his hand, but his shield and helmet weremade fast about his body, and his bronze armour rang about him.

ííííThe sons of the Achaeans came running with a loud cry towards him,hoping to drag him away, and they showered their darts on the Trojans,but none of them could wound him before he was surrounded andcovered by the princes Polydamas, Aeneas, Agenor, Sarpedon captainof the Lycians, and noble Glaucus: of the others, too, there was notone who was unmindful of him, and they held their round shields overhim to cover him. His comrades then lifted him off the ground and borehim away from the battle to the place where his horses stood waitingfor him at the rear of the fight with their driver and the chariot;these then took him towards the city groaning and in great pain.When they reached the ford of the air stream of Xanthus, begotten ofImmortal Jove, they took him from off his chariot and laid him down onthe ground; they poured water over him, and as they did so he breathedagain and opened his eyes. Then kneeling on his knees he vomitedblood, but soon fell back on to the ground, and his eyes were againclosed in darkness for he was still sturined by the blow.

ííííWhen the Argives saw Hector leaving the field, they took heart andset upon the Trojans yet more furiously. Ajax fleet son of Oileusbegan by springing on Satnius son of Enops and wounding him with hisspear: a fair naiad nymph had borne him to Enops as he was herdingcattle by the banks of the river Satnioeis. The son of Oileus cameup to him and struck him in the flank so that he fell, and a fiercefight between Trojans and Danaans raged round his body. Polydamasson of Panthous drew near to avenge him, and wounded Prothoenor son ofAreilycus on the right shoulder; the terrible spear went right throughhis shoulder, and he clutched the earth as he fell in the dust.Polydamas vaunted loudly over him saying, ""Again I take it that thespear has not sped in vain from the strong hand of the son ofPanthous; an Argive has caught it in his body, and it will serve himfor a staff as he goes down into the house of Hades.""

ííííThe Argives were maddened by this boasting. Ajax son of Telamonwas more angry than any, for the man had fallen close be, him; so heaimed at Polydamas as he was retreating, but Polydamas saved himselfby swerving aside and the spear struck Archelochus son of Antenor, forheaven counselled his destruction; it struck him where the headsprings from the neck at the top joint of the spine, and severedboth the tendons at the back of the head. His head, mouth, andnostrils reached the ground long before his legs and knees could doso, and Ajax shouted to Polydamas saying, ""Think, Polydamas, andtell me truly whether this man is not as well worth killing asProthoenor was: he seems rich, and of rich family, a brother, it maybe, or son of the knight Antenor, for he is very like him.""

ííííBut he knew well who it was, and the Trojans were greatly angered.Acamas then bestrode his brother's body and wounded Promachus theBoeotian with his spear, for he was trying to drag his brother'sbody away. Acamas vaunted loudly over him saying, ""Argive archers,braggarts that you are, toil and suffering shall not be for us only,but some of you too shall fall here as well as ourselves. See howPromachus now sleeps, vanquished by my spear; payment for my brother'sblood has not long delayed; a man, therefore, may well be thankfulif he leaves a kinsman in his house behind him to avenge his fall.""

ííííHis taunts infuriated the Argives, and Peneleos was more enragedthan any of them. He sprang towards Acamas, but Acamas did not standhis ground, and he killed Ilioneus son of the rich flock-masterPhorbas, whom Mercury had favoured and endowed with greater wealththan any other of the Trojans. Ilioneus was his only son, and Peneleosnow wounded him in the eye under his eyebrows, tearing the eye-ballfrom its socket: the spear went right through the eye into the nape ofthe neck, and he fell, stretching out both hands before him.Peneleos then drew his sword and smote him on the neck, so that bothhead and helmet came tumbling down to the ground with the spearstill sticking in the eye; he then held up the head, as though ithad been a poppy-head, and showed it to the Trojans, vaunting overthem as he did so. ""Trojans,"" he cried, ""bid the father and motherof noble Ilioneus make moan for him in their house, for the wifealso of Promachus son of Alegenor will never be gladdened by thecoming of her dear husband- when we Argives return with our ships fromTroy.""

ííííAs he spoke fear fell upon them, and every man looked round about tosee whither he might fly for safety.

ííííTell me now, O Muses that dwell on Olympus, who was the first of theArgives to bear away blood-stained spoils after Neptune lord of theearthquake had turned the fortune of war. Ajax son of Telamon wasfirst to wound Hyrtius son of Gyrtius, captain of the staunch Mysians.Antilochus killed Phalces and Mermerus, while Meriones slew Morysand Hippotion, Teucer also killed Prothoon and Periphetes. The sonof Atreus then wounded Hyperenor shepherd of his people, in the flank,and the bronze point made his entrails gush out as it tore in amongthem; on this his life came hurrying out of him at the place wherehe had been wounded, and his eyes were closed in darkness. Ajax son ofOileus killed more than any other, for there was no man so fleet as heto pursue flying foes when Jove had spread panic among them.

ííííBOOK XV

ííííBUT when their flight had taken them past the trench and the setstakes, and many had fallen by the hands of the Danaans, the Trojansmade a halt on reaching their chariots, routed and pale with fear.Jove now woke on the crests of Ida, where he was lying withgolden-throned Juno by his side, and starting to his feet he saw theTrojans and Achaeans, the one thrown into confusion, and the othersdriving them pell-mell before them with King Neptune in their midst.He saw Hector lying on the ground with his comrades gathered roundhim, gasping for breath, wandering in mind and vomiting blood, forit was not the feeblest of the Achaeans who struck him.

ííííThe sire of gods and men had pity on him, and looked fiercely onJuno. ""I see, Juno,"" said he, ""you mischief- making trickster, thatyour cunning has stayed Hector from fighting and has caused the routof his host. I am in half a mind to thrash you, in which case you willbe the first to reap the fruits of your scurvy knavery. Do you notremember how once upon a time I had you hanged? I fastened twoanvils on to your feet, and bound your hands in a chain of goldwhich none might break, and you hung in mid-air among the clouds.All the gods in Olympus were in a fury, but they could not reach youto set you free; when I caught any one of them I gripped him andhurled him from the heavenly threshold till he came fainting down toearth; yet even this did not relieve my mind from the incessantanxiety which I felt about noble Hercules whom you and Boreas hadspitefully conveyed beyond the seas to Cos, after suborning thetempests; but I rescued him, and notwithstanding all his mightylabours I brought him back again to Argos. I would remind you ofthis that you may learn to leave off being so deceitful, anddiscover how much you are likely to gain by the embraces out ofwhich you have come here to trick me.""

ííííJuno trembled as he spoke, and said, ""May heaven above and earthbelow be my witnesses, with the waters of the river Styx- and thisis the most solemn oath that a blessed god can take- nay, I swear alsoby your own almighty head and by our bridal bed- things over which Icould never possibly perjure myself- that Neptune is not punishingHector and the Trojans and helping the Achaeans through any doing ofmine; it is all of his own mere motion because he was sorry to see theAchaeans hard pressed at their ships: if I were advising him, I shouldtell him to do as you bid him.""

ííííThe sire of gods and men smiled and answered, ""If you, Juno, werealways to support me when we sit in council of the gods, Neptune, likeit or no, would soon come round to your and my way of thinking. If,then, you are speaking the truth and mean what you say, go among therank and file of the gods, and tell Iris and Apollo lord of the bow,that I want them- Iris, that she may go to the Achaean host and tellNeptune to leave off fighting and go home, and Apollo, that he maysend Hector again into battle and give him fresh strength; he willthus forget his present sufferings, and drive the Achaeans back inconfusion till they fall among the ships of Achilles son of Peleus.Achilles will then send his comrade Patroclus into battle, andHector will kill him in front of Ilius after he has slain manywarriors, and among them my own noble son Sarpedon. Achilles will killHector to avenge Patroclus, and from that time I will bring it aboutthat the Achaeans shall persistently drive the Trojans back tillthey fulfil the counsels of Minerva and take Ilius. But I will notstay my anger, nor permit any god to help the Danaans till I haveaccomplished the desire of the son of Peleus, according to the promiseI made by bowing my head on the day when Thetis touched my knees andbesought me to give him honour.""

ííííJuno heeded his words and went from the heights of Ida to greatOlympus. Swift as the thought of one whose fancy carries him over vastcontinents, and he says to himself, ""Now I will be here, or there,""and he would have all manner of things- even so swiftly did Junowing her way till she came to high Olympus and went in among thegods who were gathered in the house of Jove. When they saw her theyall of them came up to her, and held out their cups to her by way ofgreeting. She let the others be, but took the cup offered her bylovely Themis, who was first to come running up to her. ""Juno,"" saidshe, ""why are you here? And you seem troubled- has your husband theson of Saturn been frightening you?""

ííííAnd Juno answered, ""Themis, do not ask me about it. You know whata proud and cruel disposition my husband has. Lead the gods totable, where you and all the immortals can hear the wicked designswhich he has avowed. Many a one, mortal and immortal, will beangered by them, however peaceably he may be feasting now.""

ííííOn this Juno sat down, and the gods were troubled throughout thehouse of Jove. Laughter sat on her lips but her brow was furrowed withcare, and she spoke up in a rage. ""Fools that we are,"" she cried,""to be thus madly angry with Jove; we keep on wanting to go up tohim and stay him by force or by persuasion, but he sits aloof andcares for nobody, for he knows that he is much stronger than any otherof the immortals. Make the best, therefore, of whatever ills he maychoose to send each one of you; Mars, I take it, has had a taste ofthem already, for his son Ascalaphus has fallen in battle- the manwhom of all others he loved most dearly and whose father he ownshimself to be.""

ííííWhen he heard this Mars smote his two sturdy thighs with the flat ofhis hands, and said in anger, ""Do not blame me, you gods that dwell inheaven, if I go to the ships of the Achaeans and avenge the death ofmy son, even though it end in my being struck by Jove's lightningand lying in blood and dust among the corpses.""

ííííAs he spoke he gave orders to yoke his horses Panic and Rout,while he put on his armour. On this, Jove would have been roused tostill more fierce and implacable enmity against the other immortals,had not Minerva, ararmed for the safety of the gods, sprung from herseat and hurried outside. She tore the helmet from his head and theshield from his shoulders, and she took the bronze spear from hisstrong hand and set it on one side; then she said to Mars, ""Madman,you are undone; you have ears that hear not, or you have lost alljudgement and understanding; have you not heard what Juno has saidon coming straight from the presence of Olympian Jove? Do you wishto go through all kinds of suffering before you are brought backsick and sorry to Olympus, after having caused infinite mischief toall us others? Jove would instantly leave the Trojans and Achaeansto themselves; he would come to Olympus to punish us, and would gripus up one after another, guilty or not guilty. Therefore lay asideyour anger for the death of your son; better men than he have eitherbeen killed already or will fall hereafter, and one cannot protectevery one's whole family.""

ííííWith these words she took Mars back to his seat. Meanwhile Junocalled Apollo outside, with Iris the messenger of the gods. ""Jove,""she said to them, ""desires you to go to him at once on Mt. Ida; whenyou have seen him you are to do as he may then bid you.""

ííííThereon Juno left them and resumed her seat inside, while Iris andApollo made all haste on their way. When they reachedmany-fountained Ida, mother of wild beasts, they found Jove seatedon topmost Gargarus with a fragrant cloud encircling his head aswith a diadem. They stood before his presence, and he was pleased withthem for having been so quick in obeying the orders his wife had giventhem.

ííííHe spoke to Iris first. ""Go,"" said he, ""fleet Iris, tell KingNeptune what I now bid you- and tell him true. Bid him leave offfighting, and either join the company of the gods, or go down into thesea. If he takes no heed and disobeys me, let him consider wellwhether he is strong enough to hold his own against me if I attackhim. I am older and much stronger than he is; yet he is not afraidto set himself up as on a level with myself, of whom all the othergods stand in awe.""

ííííIris, fleet as the wind, obeyed him, and as the cold hail orsnowflakes that fly from out the clouds before the blast of Boreas,even so did she wing her way till she came close up to the greatshaker of the earth. Then she said, ""I have come, O dark-haired kingthat holds the world in his embrace, to bring you a message from Jove.He bids you leave off fighting, and either join the company of thegods or go down into the sea; if, however, you take no heed anddisobey him, he says he will come down here and fight you. He wouldhave you keep out of his reach, for he is older and much stronger thanyou are, and yet you are not afraid to set yourself up as on a levelwith himself, of whom all the other gods stand in awe.""

ííííNeptune was very angry and said, ""Great heavens! strong as Jovemay be, he has said more than he can do if he has threatenedviolence against me, who am of like honour with himself. We were threebrothers whom Rhea bore to Saturn- Jove, myself, and Hades who rulesthe world below. Heaven and earth were divided into three parts, andeach of us was to have an equal share. When we cast lots, it fell tome to have my dwelling in the sea for evermore; Hades took thedarkness of the realms under the earth, while air and sky and cloudswere the portion that fell to Jove; but earth and great Olympus arethe common property of all. Therefore I will not walk as Jove wouldhave me. For all his strength, let him keep to his own third share andbe contented without threatening to lay hands upon me as though I werenobody. Let him keep his bragging talk for his own sons and daughters,who must perforce obey him.

ííííIris fleet as the wind then answered, ""Am I really, Neptune, to takethis daring and unyielding message to Jove, or will you reconsideryour answer? Sensible people are open to argument, and you know thatthe Erinyes always range themselves on the side of the older person.""

ííííNeptune answered, ""Goddess Iris, your words have been spoken inseason. It is well when a messenger shows so much discretion.Nevertheless it cuts me to the very heart that any one should rebukeso angrily another who is his own peer, and of like empire withhimself. Now, however, I will give way in spite of my displeasure;furthermore let me tell you, and I mean what I say- if contrary to thedesire of myself, Minerva driver of the spoil, Juno, Mercury, and KingVulcan, Jove spares steep Ilius, and will not let the Achaeans havethe great triumph of sacking it, let him understand that he will incurour implacable resentment.""

ííííNeptune now left the field to go down under the sea, and sorelydid the Achaeans miss him. Then Jove said to Apollo, ""Go, dearPhoebus, to Hector, for Neptune who holds the earth in his embrace hasnow gone down under the sea to avoid the severity of my displeasure.Had he not done so those gods who are below with Saturn would havecome to hear of the fight between us. It is better for both of us thathe should have curbed his anger and kept out of my reach, for I shouldhave had much trouble with him. Take, then, your tasselled aegis,and shake it furiously, so as to set the Achaean heroes in a panic;take, moreover, brave Hector, O Far-Darter, into your own care, androuse him to deeds of daring, till the Achaeans are sent flying backto their ships and to the Hellespont. From that point I will thinkit well over, how the Achaeans may have a respite from theirtroubles.""

ííííApollo obeyed his father's saying, and left the crests of Ida,flying like a falcon, bane of doves and swiftest of all birds. Hefound Hector no longer lying upon the ground, but sitting up, for hehad just come to himself again. He knew those who were about him,and the sweat and hard breathing had left him from the moment when thewill of aegis-bearing Jove had revived him. Apollo stood beside himand said, ""Hector, son of Priam, why are you so faint, and why are youhere away from the others? Has any mishap befallen you?""

ííííHector in a weak voice answered, ""And which, kind sir, of the godsare you, who now ask me thus? Do you not know that Ajax struck me onthe chest with a stone as I was killing his comrades at the ships ofthe Achaeans, and compelled me to leave off fighting? I made sure thatthis very day I should breathe my last and go down into the house ofHades.""

ííííThen King Apollo said to him, ""Take heart; the son of Saturn hassent you a mighty helper from Ida to stand by you and defend you, evenme, Phoebus Apollo of the golden sword, who have been guardianhitherto not only of yourself but of your city. Now, therefore,order your horsemen to drive their chariots to the ships in greatmultitudes. I will go before your horses to smooth the way for them,and will turn the Achaeans in flight.""

ííííAs he spoke he infused great strength into the shepherd of hispeople. And as a horse, stabled and full-fed, breaks loose and gallopsgloriously over the plain to the place where he is wont to take hisbath in the river- he tosses his head, and his mane streams over hisshoulders as in all the pride of his strength he flies full speed tothe pastures where the mares are feeding- even so Hector, when heheard what the god said, urged his horsemen on, and sped forward asfast as his limbs could take him. As country peasants set their houndson to a homed stag or wild goat- he has taken shelter under rock orthicket, and they cannot find him, but, lo, a bearded lion whomtheir shouts have roused stands in their path, and they are in nofurther humour for the chase- even so the Achaeans were still chargingon in a body, using their swords and spears pointed at both ends,but when they saw Hector going about among his men they were afraid,and their hearts fell down into their feet.

ííííThen spoke Thoas son of Andraemon, leader of the Aetolians, a manwho could throw a good throw, and who was staunch also in close fight,while few could surpass him in debate when opinions were divided. Hethen with all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus: ""What, inheaven's name, do I now see? Is it not Hector come to life again?Every one made sure he had been killed by Ajax son of Telamon, butit seems that one of the gods has again rescued him. He has killedmany of us Danaans already, and I take it will yet do so, for the handof Jove must be with him or he would never dare show himself somasterful in the forefront of the battle. Now, therefore, let us alldo as I say; let us order the main body of our forces to fall backupon the ships, but let those of us who profess to be the flower ofthe army stand firm, and see whether we cannot hold Hector back at thepoint of our spears as soon as he comes near us; I conceive that hewill then think better of it before he tries to charge into thepress of the Danaans.""

ííííThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. Those whowere about Ajax and King Idomeneus, the followers moreover ofTeucer, Meriones, and Meges peer of Mars called all their best menabout them and sustained the fight against Hector and the Trojans, butthe main body fell back upon the ships of the Achaeans.

ííííThe Trojans pressed forward in a dense body, with Hector striding onat their head. Before him went Phoebus Apollo shrouded in cloudabout his shoulders. He bore aloft the terrible aegis with itsshaggy fringe, which Vulcan the smith had given Jove to striketerror into the hearts of men. With this in his hand he led on theTrojans.

ííííThe Argives held together and stood their ground. The cry ofbattle rose high from either side, and the arrows flew from thebowstrings. Many a spear sped from strong hands and fastened in thebodies of many a valiant warrior, while others fell to earth midway,before they could taste of man's fair flesh and glut themselves withblood. So long as Phoebus Apollo held his aegis quietly and withoutshaking it, the weapons on either side took effect and the peoplefell, but when he shook it straight in the face of the Danaans andraised his mighty battle-cry their hearts fainted within them and theyforgot their former prowess. As when two wild beasts spring in thedead of night on a herd of cattle or a large flock of sheep when theherdsman is not there- even so were the Danaans struck helpless, forApollo filled them with panic and gave victory to Hector and theTrojans.

ííííThe fight then became more scattered and they killed one anotherwhere they best could. Hector killed Stichius and Arcesilaus, the one,leader of the Boeotians, and the other, friend and comrade ofMenestheus. Aeneas killed Medon and Iasus. The first was bastard sonto Oileus, and brother to Ajax, but he lived in Phylace away fromhis own country, for he had killed a man, a kinsman of hisstepmother Eriopis whom Oileus had married. Iasus had become aleader of the Athenians, and was son of Sphelus the son of Boucolos.Polydamas killed Mecisteus, and Polites Echius, in the front of thebattle, while Agenor slew Clonius. Paris struck Deiochus from behindin the lower part of the shoulder, as he was flying among theforemost, and the point of the spear went clean through him.

ííííWhile they were spoiling these heroes of their armour, theAchaeans were flying pellmell to the trench and the set stakes, andwere forced back within their wall. Hector then cried out to theTrojans, ""Forward to the ships, and let the spoils be. If I see anyman keeping back on the other side the wall away from the ships I willhave him killed: his kinsmen and kinswomen shall not give him his duesof fire, but dogs shall tear him in pieces in front of our city.""

ííííAs he spoke he laid his whip about his horses' shoulders andcalled to the Trojans throughout their ranks; the Trojans shouted witha cry that rent the air, and kept their horses neck and neck withhis own. Phoebus Apollo went before, and kicked down the banks ofthe deep trench into its middle so as to make a great broad bridge, asbroad as the throw of a spear when a man is trying his strength. TheTrojan battalions poured over the bridge, and Apollo with hisredoubtable aegis led the way. He kicked down the wall of the Achaeansas easily as a child who playing on the sea-shore has built a house ofsand and then kicks it down again and destroys it- even so did you,O Apollo, shed toil and trouble upon the Argives, filling them withpanic and confusion.

ííííThus then were the Achaeans hemmed in at their ships, calling out toone another and raising their hands with loud cries every man toheaven. Nestor of Gerene, tower of strength to the Achaeans, lifted uphis hands to the starry firmament of heaven, and prayed more ferventlythan any of them. ""Father Jove,"" said he, ""if ever any one inwheat-growing Argos burned you fat thigh-bones of sheep or heiferand prayed that he might return safely home, whereon you bowed yourhead to him in assent, bear it in mind now, and suffer not the Trojansto triumph thus over the Achaeans.""

ííííAll counselling Jove thundered loudly in answer to die prayer of theaged son of Neleus. When the heard Jove thunder they flungthemselves yet more fiercely on the Achaeans. As a wave breakingover the bulwarks of a ship when the sea runs high before a gale-for it is the force of the wind that makes the waves so great- even sodid the Trojans spring over the wall with a shout, and drive theirchariots onwards. The two sides fought with their double-pointedspears in hand-to-hand encounter-the Trojans from their chariots,and the Achaeans climbing up into their ships and wielding the longpikes that were lying on the decks ready for use in a sea-fight,jointed and shod with bronze.

ííííNow Patroclus, so long as the Achaeans and Trojans were fightingabout the wall, but were not yet within it and at the ships,remained sitting in the tent of good Eurypylus, entertaining himwith his conversation and spreading herbs over his wound to ease hispain. When, however, he saw the Trojans swarming through the breach inthe wall, while the Achaeans were clamouring and struck with panic, hecried aloud, and smote his two thighs with the flat of his hands.""Eurypylus,"" said he in his dismay, ""I know you want me badly, but Icannot stay with you any longer, for there is hard fighting goingon; a servant shall take care of you now, for I must make all speed toAchilles, and induce him to fight if I can; who knows but withheaven's help I may persuade him. A man does well to listen to theadvice of a friend.""

ííííWhen he had thus spoken he went his way. The Achaeans stood firm andresisted the attack of the Trojans, yet though these were fewer innumber, they could not drive them back from the ships, neither couldthe Trojans break the Achaean ranks and make their way in among thetents and ships. As a carpenter's line gives a true edge to a piece ofship's timber, in the hand of some skilled workman whom Minerva hasinstructed in all kinds of useful arts- even so level was the issue ofthe fight between the two sides, as they fought some round one andsome round another.

ííííHector made straight for Ajax, and the two fought fiercely about thesame ship. Hector could not force Ajax back and fire the ship, nor yetcould Ajax drive Hector from the spot to which heaven had brought him.

ííííThen Ajax struck Caletor son of Clytius in the chest with a spear ashe was bringing fire towards the ship. He fell heavily to the groundand the torch dropped from his hand. When Hector saw his cousin fallenin front of the ship he shouted to the Trojans and Lycians saying,""Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians good in close fight, bate not a jot,but rescue the son of Clytius lest the Achaeans strip him of hisarmour now that he has fallen.""

ííííHe then aimed a spear at Ajax, and missed him, but he hitLycophron a follower of Ajax, who came from Cythera, but was livingwith Ajax inasmuch as he had killed a man among the Cythereans.Hector's spear struck him on the head below the ear, and he fellheadlong from the ship's prow on to the ground with no life left inhim. Ajax shook with rage and said to his brother, ""Teucer, my goodfellow, our trusty comrade the son of Mastor has fallen, he came tolive with us from Cythera and whom we honoured as much as our ownparents. Hector has just killed him; fetch your deadly arrows atonce and the bow which Phoebus Apollo gave you.""

ííííTeucer heard him and hastened towards him with his bow and quiver inhis hands. Forthwith he showered his arrows on the Trojans, and hitCleitus the son of Pisenor, comrade of Polydamas the noble son ofPanthous, with the reins in his hands as he was attending to hishorses; he was in the middle of the very thickest part of the fight,doing good service to Hector and the Trojans, but evil had now comeupon him, and not one of those who were fain to do so could avertit, for the arrow struck him on the back of the neck. He fell from hischariot and his horses shook the empty car as they swerved aside. KingPolydamas saw what had happened, and was the first to come up to thehorses; he gave them in charge to Astynous son of Protiaon, andordered him to look on, and to keep the horses near at hand. He thenwent back and took his place in the front ranks.

ííííTeucer then aimed another arrow at Hector, and there would have beenno more fighting at the ships if he had hit him and killed him thenand there: Jove, however, who kept watch over Hector, had his eyeson Teucer, and deprived him of his triumph, by breaking hisbowstring for him just as he was drawing it and about to take his aim;on this the arrow went astray and the bow fell from his hands.Teucer shook with anger and said to his brother, ""Alas, see how heaventhwarts us in all we do; it has broken my bowstring and snatched thebow from my hand, though I strung it this selfsame morning that itmight serve me for many an arrow.""

ííííAjax son of Telamon answered, ""My good fellow, let your bow and yourarrows be, for Jove has made them useless in order to spite theDanaans. Take your spear, lay your shield upon your shoulder, and bothfight the Trojans yourself and urge others to do so. They may besuccessful for the moment but if we fight as we ought they will findit a hard matter to take the ships.""

ííííTeucer then took his bow and put it by in his tent. He hung a shieldfour hides thick about his shoulders, and on his comely head he sethis helmet well wrought with a crest of horse-hair that noddedmenacingly above it; he grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear, andforthwith he was by the side of Ajax.

ííííWhen Hector saw that Teucer's bow was of no more use to him, heshouted out to the Trojans and Lycians, ""Trojans, Lycians, andDardanians good in close fight, be men, my friends, and show yourmettle here at the ships, for I see the weapon of one of theirchieftains made useless by the hand of Jove. It is easy to see whenJove is helping people and means to help them still further, oragain when he is bringing them down and will do nothing for them; heis now on our side, and is going against the Argives. Thereforeswarm round the ships and fight. If any of you is struck by spear orsword and loses his life, let him die; he dies with honour who diesfighting for his country; and he will leave his wife and children safebehind him, with his house and allotment unplundered if only theAchaeans can be driven back to their own land, they and their ships.""

ííííWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Ajax on theother side exhorted his comrades saying, ""Shame on you Argives, we arenow utterly undone, unless we can save ourselves by driving theenemy from our ships. Do you think, if Hector takes them, that youwill be able to get home by land? Can you not hear him cheering on hiswhole host to fire our fleet, and bidding them remember that theyare not at a dance but in battle? Our only course is to fight themwith might and main; we had better chance it, life or death, oncefor all, than fight long and without issue hemmed in at our ships byworse men than ourselves.""

ííííWith these words he put life and soul into them all. Hector thenkilled Schedius son of Perimedes, leader of the Phoceans, and Ajaxkilled Laodamas captain of foot soldiers and son to Antenor. Polydamaskilled Otus of Cyllene a comrade of the son of Phyleus and chief ofthe proud Epeans. When Meges saw this he sprang upon him, butPolydamas crouched down, and he missed him, for Apollo would notsuffer the son of Panthous to fall in battle; but the spear hitCroesmus in the middle of his chest, whereon he fell heavily to theground, and Meges stripped him of his armour. At that moment thevaliant soldier Dolops son of Lampus sprang upon Lampus was son ofLaomedon and for his valour, while his son Dolops was versed in allthe ways of war. He then struck the middle of the son of Phyleus'shield with his spear, setting on him at close quarters, but hisgood corslet made with plates of metal saved him; Phyleus hadbrought it from Ephyra and the river Selleis, where his host, KingEuphetes, had given it him to wear in battle and protect him. It nowserved to save the life of his son. Then Meges struck the topmostcrest of Dolops's bronze helmet with his spear and tore away its plumeof horse-hair, so that all newly dyed with scarlet as it was ittumbled down into the dust. While he was still fighting andconfident of victory, Menelaus came up to help Meges, and got by theside of Dolops unperceived; he then speared him in the shoulder,from behind, and the point, driven so furiously, went through into hischest, whereon he fell headlong. The two then made towards him tostrip him of his armour, but Hector called on all his brothers forhelp, and he especially upbraided brave Melanippus son of Hiketaon,who erewhile used to pasture his herds of cattle in Percote before thewar broke out; but when the ships of the Danaans came, he went back toIlius, where he was eminent among the Trojans, and lived near Priamwho treated him as one of his own sons. Hector now rebuked him andsaid, ""Why, Melanippus, are we thus remiss? do you take no note of thedeath of your kinsman, and do you not see how they are trying totake Dolops's armour? Follow me; there must be no fighting the Argivesfrom a distance now, but we must do so in close combat till eitherwe kill them or they take the high wall of Ilius and slay her people.""

ííííHe led on as he spoke, and the hero Melanippus followed after.Meanwhile Ajax son of Telamon was cheering on the Argives. ""Myfriends,"" he cried, ""be men, and fear dishonour; quit yourselves inbattle so as to win respect from one another. Men who respect eachother's good opinion are less likely to be killed than those who donot, but in flight there is neither gain nor glory.""

ííííThus did he exhort men who were already bent upon driving back theTrojans. They laid his words to heart and hedged the ships as with awall of bronze, while Jove urged on the Trojans. Menelaus of theloud battle-cry urged Antilochus on. ""Antilochus,"" said he, ""you areyoung and there is none of the Achaeans more fleet of foot or morevaliant than you are. See if you cannot spring upon some Trojan andkill him.""

ííííHe hurried away when he had thus spurred Antilochus, who at oncedarted out from the front ranks and aimed a spear, after lookingcarefully round him. The Trojans fell back as he threw, and the dartdid not speed from his hand without effect, for it struck Melanippusthe proud son of Hiketaon in the breast by the nipple as he was comingforward, and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavilyto the ground. Antilochus sprang upon him as a dog springs on a fawnwhich a hunter has hit as it was breaking away from its covert, andkilled it. Even so, O Melanippus, did stalwart Antilochus springupon you to strip you of your armour; but noble Hector marked him, andcame running up to him through the thick of the battle. Antilochus,brave soldier though he was, would not stay to face him, but fled likesome savage creature which knows it has done wrong, and flies, when ithas killed a dog or a man who is herding his cattle, before a bodyof men can be gathered to attack it. Even so did the son of Nestorfly, and the Trojans and Hector with a cry that rent the airshowered their weapons after him; nor did he turn round and stay hisflight till he had reached his comrades.

ííííThe Trojans, fierce as lions, were still rushing on towards theships in fulfilment of the behests of Jove who kept spurring them onto new deeds of daring, while he deadened the courage of the Argivesand defeated them by encouraging the Trojans. For he meant givingglory to Hector son of Priam, and letting him throw fire upon theships, till he had fulfilled the unrighteous prayer that Thetis hadmade him; Jove, therefore, bided his time till he should see the glareof a blazing ship. From that hour he was about so to order that theTrojans should be driven back from the ships and to vouchsafe glory tothe Achaeans. With this purpose he inspired Hector son of Priam, whowas cager enough already, to assail the ships. His fury was as that ofMars, or as when a fire is raging in the glades of some dense forestupon the mountains; he foamed at the mouth, his eyes glared underhis terrible eye-brows, and his helmet quivered on his temples byreason of the fury with which he fought. Jove from heaven was withhim, and though he was but one against many, vouchsafed him victoryand glory; for he was doomed to an early death, and already PallasMinerva was hurrying on the hour of his destruction at the hands ofthe son of Peleus. Now, however, he kept trying to break the ranksof the enemy wherever he could see them thickest, and in the goodliestarmour; but do what he might he could not break through them, for theystood as a tower foursquare, or as some high cliff rising from thegrey sea that braves the anger of the gale, and of the waves thatthunder up against it. He fell upon them like flames of fire fromevery quarter. As when a wave, raised mountain high by wind and storm,breaks over a ship and covers it deep in foam, the fierce winds roaragainst the mast, the hearts of the sailors fail them for fear, andthey are saved but by a very little from destruction- even so were thehearts of the Achaeans fainting within them. Or as a savage lionattacking a herd of cows while they are feeding by thousands in thelow-lying meadows by some wide-watered shore- the herdsman is at hiswit's end how to protect his herd and keeps going about now in the vanand now in the rear of his cattle, while the lion springs into thethick of them and fastens on a cow so that they all tremble forfear- even so were the Achaeans utterly panic-stricken by Hector andfather Jove. Nevertheless Hector only killed Periphetes of Mycenae; hewas son of Copreus who was wont to take the orders of KingEurystheus to mighty Hercules, but the son was a far better man thanthe father in every way; he was fleet of foot, a valiant warrior,and in understanding ranked among the foremost men of Mycenae. He itwas who then afforded Hector a triumph, for as he was turning backhe stumbled against the rim of his shield which reached his feet,and served to keep the javelins off him. He tripped against this andfell face upward, his helmet ringing loudly about his head as he didso. Hector saw him fall and ran up to him; he then thrust a spear intohis chest, and killed him close to his own comrades. These, for alltheir sorrow, could not help him for they were themselves terriblyafraid of Hector.

ííííThey had now reached the ships and the prows of those that hadbeen drawn up first were on every side of them, but the Trojans camepouring after them. The Argives were driven back from the first row ofships, but they made a stand by their tents without being broken upand scattered; shame and fear restrained them. They kept shoutingincessantly to one another, and Nestor of Gerene, tower of strength tothe Achaeans, was loudest in imploring every man by his parents, andbeseeching him to stand firm.

íííí""Be men, my friends,"" he cried, ""and respect one another's goodopinion. Think, all of you, on your children, your wives, yourproperty, and your parents whether these be alive or dead. On theirbehalf though they are not here, I implore you to stand firm, andnot to turn in flight.""

ííííWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Minerva liftedthe thick veil of darkness from their eyes, and much light fell uponthem, alike on the side of the ships and on that where the fight wasraging. They could see Hector and all his men, both those in therear who were taking no part in the battle, and those who werefighting by the ships.

ííííAjax could not bring himself to retreat along with the rest, butstrode from deck to deck with a great sea-pike in his hands twelvecubits long and jointed with rings. As a man skilled in feats ofhorsemanship couples four horses together and comes tearing full speedalong the public way from the country into some large town- manyboth men and women marvel as they see him for he keeps all the timechanging his horse, springing from one to another without ever missinghis feet while the horses are at a gallop- even so did Ajax gostriding from one ship's deck to another, and his voice went up intothe heavens. He kept on shouting his orders to the Danaans andexhorting them to defend their ships and tents; neither did Hectorremain within the main body of the Trojan warriors, but as a dun eagleswoops down upon a flock of wild-fowl feeding near a river-geese, itmay be, or cranes, or long-necked swans- even so did Hector makestraight for a dark-prowed ship, rushing right towards it; for Jovewith his mighty hand impelled him forward, and roused his people tofollow him.

ííííAnd now the battle again raged furiously at the ships. You wouldhave thought the men were coming on fresh and unwearied, so fiercelydid they fight; and this was the mind in which they were- the Achaeansdid not believe they should escape destruction but thoughtthemselves doomed, while there was not a Trojan but his heart beathigh with the hope of firing the ships and putting the Achaeanheroes to the sword.

ííííThus were the two sides minded. Then Hector seized the stern ofthe good ship that had brought Protesilaus to Troy, but never bore himback to his native land. Round this ship there raged a closehand-to-hand fight between Danaans and Trojans. They did not fightat a distance with bows and javelins, but with one mind hacked atone another in close combat with their mighty swords and spearspointed at both ends; they fought moreover with keen battle-axes andwith hatchets. Many a good stout blade hilted and scabbarded withiron, fell from hand or shoulder as they fought, and the earth ran redwith blood. Hector, when he had seized the ship, would not loose hishold but held on to its curved stern and shouted to the Trojans,""Bring fire, and raise the battle-cry all of you with a singlevoice. Now has Jove vouchsafed us a day that will pay us for all therest; this day we shall take the ships which came hither againstheaven's will, and which have caused us such infinite sufferingthrough the cowardice of our councillors, who when I would have donebattle at the ships held me back and forbade the host to follow me; ifJove did then indeed warp our judgements, himself now commands meand cheers me on.""

ííííAs he spoke thus the Trojans sprang yet more fiercely on theAchaeans, and Ajax no longer held his ground, for he was overcome bythe darts that were flung at him, and made sure that he was doomed.Therefore he left the raised deck at the stern, and stepped back on tothe seven-foot bench of the oarsmen. Here he stood on the look-out,and with his spear held back Trojan whom he saw bringing fire to theships. All the time he kept on shouting at the top of his voice andexhorting the Danaans. ""My friends,"" he cried, ""Danaan heroes,servants of Mars, be men my friends, and fight with might and withmain. Can we hope to find helpers hereafter, or a wall to shield usmore surely than the one we have? There is no strong city withinreach, whence we may draw fresh forces to turn the scales in ourfavour. We are on the plain of the armed Trojans with the sea behindus, and far from our own country. Our salvation, therefore, is inthe might of our hands and in hard fighting.""

ííííAs he spoke he wielded his spear with still greater fury, and whenany Trojan made towards the ships with fire at Hector's bidding, hewould be on the look-out for him, and drive at him with his longspear. Twelve men did he thus kill in hand-to-hand fight before theships.

ííííBOOK XVI

ííííTHUS did they fight about the ship of Protesilaus. Then Patroclusdrew near to Achilles with tears welling from his eyes, as from somespring whose crystal stream falls over the ledges of a high precipice.When Achilles saw him thus weeping he was sorry for him and said,""Why, Patroclus, do you stand there weeping like some silly child thatcomes running to her mother, and begs to be taken up and carried-she catches hold of her mother's dress to stay her though she is ina hurry, and looks tearfully up until her mother carries her- evensuch tears, Patroclus, are you now shedding. Have you anything tosay to the Myrmidons or to myself? or have you had news from Phthiawhich you alone know? They tell me Menoetius son of Actor is stillalive, as also Peleus son of Aeacus, among the Myrmidons- men whoseloss we two should bitterly deplore; or are you grieving about theArgives and the way in which they are being killed at the ships, throutheir own high-handed doings? Do not hide anything from me but tell methat both of us may know about it.""

ííííThen, O knight Patroclus, with a deep sigh you answered,""Achilles, son of Peleus, foremost champion of the Achaeans, do not beangry, but I weep for the disaster that has now befallen theArgives. All those who have been their champions so far are lying atthe ships, wounded by sword or spear. Brave Diomed son of Tydeus hasbeen hit with a spear, while famed Ulysses and Agamemnon have receivedsword-wounds; Eurypylus again has been struck with an arrow in thethigh; skilled apothecaries are attending to these heroes, and healingthem of their wounds; are you still, O Achilles, so inexorable? May itnever be my lot to nurse such a passion as you have done, to thebaning of your own good name. Who in future story will speak well ofyou unless you now save the Argives from ruin? You know no pity;knight Peleus was not your father nor Thetis your mother, but the greysea bore you and the sheer cliffs begot you, so cruel andremorseless are you. If however you are kept back through knowledge ofsome oracle, or if your mother Thetis has told you something fromthe mouth of Jove, at least send me and the Myrmidons with me, if Imay bring deliverance to the Danaans. Let me moreover wear yourarmour; the Trojans may thus mistake me for you and quit the field, sothat the hard-pressed sons of the Achaeans may have breathing time-which while they are fighting may hardly be. We who are fresh mightsoon drive tired men back from our ships and tents to their own city.""

ííííHe knew not what he was asking, nor that he was suing for his owndestruction. Achilles was deeply moved and answered, ""What, noblePatroclus, are you saying? I know no prophesyings which I amheeding, nor has my mother told me anything from the mouth of Jove,but I am cut to the very heart that one of my own rank should dareto rob me because he is more powerful than I am. This, after allthat I have gone through, is more than I can endure. The girl whom thesons of the Achaeans chose for me, whom I won as the fruit of my spearon having sacked a city- her has King Agamemnon taken from me asthough I were some common vagrant. Still, let bygones be bygones: noman may keep his anger for ever; I said I would not relent till battleand the cry of war had reached my own ships; nevertheless, now gird myarmour about your shoulders, and lead the Myrmidons to battle, for thedark cloud of Trojans has burst furiously over our fleet; theArgives are driven back on to the beach, cooped within a narrow space,and the whole people of Troy has taken heart to sally out againstthem, because they see not the visor of my helmet gleaming nearthem. Had they seen this, there would not have been a creek nor gripthat had not been filled with their dead as they fled back again.And so it would have been, if only King Agamemnon had dealt fairlyby me. As it is the Trojans have beset our host. Diomed son ofTydeus no longer wields his spear to defend the Danaans, neitherhave I heard the voice of the son of Atreus coming from his hatedhead, whereas that of murderous Hector rings in my cars as he givesorders to the Trojans, who triumph over the Achaeans and fill thewhole plain with their cry of battle. But even so, Patroclus, fallupon them and save the fleet, lest the Trojans fire it and preventus from being able to return. Do, however, as I now bid you, thatyou may win me great honour from all the Danaans, and that they mayrestore the girl to me again and give me rich gifts into thebargain. When you have driven the Trojans from the ships, come backagain. Though Juno's thundering husband should put triumph within yourreach, do not fight the Trojans further in my absence, or you will robme of glory that should be mine. And do not for lust of battle go onkilling the Trojans nor lead the Achaeans on to Ilius, lest one of theever-living gods from Olympus attack you- for Phoebus Apollo lovesthem well: return when you have freed the ships from peril, and letothers wage war upon the plain. Would, by father Jove, Minerva, andApollo, that not a single man of all the Trojans might be leftalive, nor yet of the Argives, but that we two might be alone leftto tear aside the mantle that veils the brow of Troy.""

ííííThus did they converse. But Ajax could no longer hold his ground forthe shower of darts that rained upon him; the will of Jove and thejavelins of the Trojans were too much for him; the helmet that gleamedabout his temples rang with the continuous clatter of the missilesthat kept pouring on to it and on to the cheek-pieces that protectedhis face. Moreover his left shoulder was tired with having held hisshield so long, yet for all this, let fly at him as they would, theycould not make him give ground. He could hardly draw his breath, thesweat rained from every pore of his body, he had not a moment'srespite, and on all sides he was beset by danger upon danger.

ííííAnd now, tell me, O Muses that hold your mansions on Olympus, howfire was thrown upon the ships of the Achaeans. Hector came close upand let drive with his great sword at the ashen spear of Ajax. Hecut it clean in two just behind where the point was fastened on to theshaft of the spear. Ajax, therefore, had now nothing but a headlessspear, while the bronze point flew some way off and came ringingdown on to the ground. Ajax knew the hand of heaven in this, and wasdismayed at seeing that Jove had now left him utterly defencelessand was willing victory for the Trojans. Therefore he drew back, andthe Trojans flung fire upon the ship which was at once wrapped inflame.

ííííThe fire was now flaring about the ship's stern, whereon Achillessmote his two thighs and said to Patroclus, ""Up, noble knight, for Isee the glare of hostile fire at our fleet; up, lest they destroyour ships, and there be no way by which we may retreat. Gird on yourarmour at once while I call our people together.""

ííííAs he spoke Patroclus put on his armour. First he greaved his legswith greaves of good make, and fitted with ancle-clasps of silver;after this he donned the cuirass of the son of Aeacus, richly inlaidand studded. He hung his silver-studded sword of bronze about hisshoulders, and then his mighty shield. On his comely head he set hishelmet, well wrought, with a crest of horse-hair that noddedmenacingly above it. He grasped two redoubtable spears that suited hishands, but he did not take the spear of noble Achilles, so stout andstrong, for none other of the Achaeans could wield it, though Achillescould do so easily. This was the ashen spear from Mount Pelion,which Chiron had cut upon a mountain top and had given to Peleus,wherewith to deal out death among heroes. He bade Automedon yoke hishorses with all speed, for he was the man whom he held in honournext after Achilles, and on whose support in battle he could rely mostfirmly. Automedon therefore yoked the fleet horses Xanthus and Balius,steeds that could fly like the wind: these were they whom the harpyPodarge bore to the west wind, as she was grazing in a meadow by thewaters of the river Oceanus. In the side traces he set the noble horsePedasus, whom Achilles had brought away with him when he sacked thecity of Eetion, and who, mortal steed though he was, could take hisplace along with those that were immortal.

ííííMeanwhile Achilles went about everywhere among the tents, and badehis Myrmidons put on their armour. Even as fierce ravening wolves thatare feasting upon a homed stag which they have killed upon themountains, and their jaws are red with blood- they go in a pack to lapwater from the clear spring with their long thin tongues; and theyreek of blood and slaughter; they know not what fear is, for it ishunger drives them- even so did the leaders and counsellors of theMyrmidons gather round the good squire of the fleet descendant ofAeacus, and among them stood Achilles himself cheering on both men andhorses.

ííííFifty ships had noble Achilles brought to Troy, and in each therewas a crew of fifty oarsmen. Over these he set five captains whom hecould trust, while he was himself commander over them all.Menesthius of the gleaming corslet, son to the river Spercheius thatstreams from heaven, was captain of the first company. Fair Polydoradaughter of Peleus bore him to ever-flowing Spercheius- a womanmated with a god- but he was called son of Borus son of Perieres, withwhom his mother was living as his wedded wife, and who gave greatwealth to gain her. The second company was led by noble Eudorus, sonto an unwedded woman. Polymele, daughter of Phylas the gracefuldancer, bore him; the mighty slayer of Argos was enamoured of her ashe saw her among the singing women at a dance held in honour ofDiana the rushing huntress of the golden arrows; he therefore-Mercury, giver of all good- went with her into an upper chamber, andlay with her in secret, whereon she bore him a noble son Eudorus,singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant. When Ilithuia goddessof the pains of child-birth brought him to the light of day, and hesaw the face of the sun, mighty Echecles son of Actor took themother to wife, and gave great wealth to gain her, but her fatherPhylas brought the child up, and took care of him, doting as fondlyupon him as though he were his own son. The third company was led byPisander son of Maemalus, the finest spearman among all theMyrmidons next to Achilles' own comrade Patroclus. The old knightPhoenix was captain of the fourth company, and Alcimedon, noble son ofLaerceus of the fifth.

ííííWhen Achilles had chosen his men and had stationed them all withtheir captains, he charged them straitly saying, ""Myrmidons,remember your threats against the Trojans while you were at theships in the time of my anger, and you were all complaining of me.'Cruel son of Peleus,' you would say, 'your mother must have suckledyou on gall, so ruthless are you. You keep us here at the shipsagainst our will; if you are so relentless it were better we went homeover the sea.' Often have you gathered and thus chided with me. Thehour is now come for those high feats of arms that you have so longbeen pining for, therefore keep high hearts each one of you to dobattle with the Trojans.""

ííííWith these words he put heart and soul into them all, and theyserried their companies yet more closely when they heard the oftheir king. As the stones which a builder sets in the wall of somehigh house which is to give shelter from the winds- even so closelywere the helmets and bossed shields set against one another. Shieldpressed on shield, helm on helm, and man on man; so close were theythat the horse-hair plumes on the gleaming ridges of their helmetstouched each other as they bent their heads.

ííííIn front of them all two men put on their armour- Patroclus andAutomedon- two men, with but one mind to lead the Myrmidons. ThenAchilles went inside his tent and opened the lid of the strong chestwhich silver-footed Thetis had given him to take on board ship, andwhich she had filled with shirts, cloaks to keep out the cold, andgood thick rugs. In this chest he had a cup of rare workmanship,from which no man but himself might drink, nor would he makeoffering from it to any other god save only to father Jove. He tookthe cup from the chest and cleansed it with sulphur; this done herinsed it clean water, and after he had washed his hands he drew wine.Then he stood in the middle of the court and prayed, looking towardsheaven, and making his drink-offering of wine; nor was he unseen ofJove whose joy is in thunder. ""King Jove,"" he cried, ""lord ofDodona, god of the Pelasgi, who dwellest afar, you who hold wintryDodona in your sway, where your prophets the Selli dwell around youwith their feet unwashed and their couches made upon the ground- ifyou heard me when I prayed to you aforetime, and did me honour whileyou sent disaster on the Achaeans, vouchsafe me now the fulfilmentof yet this further prayer. I shall stay here where my ships arelying, but I shall send my comrade into battle at the head of manyMyrmidons. Grant, O all-seeing Jove, that victory may go with him; putyour courage into his heart that Hector may learn whether my squire isman enough to fight alone, or whether his might is only then soindomitable when I myself enter the turmoil of war. Afterwards when hehas chased the fight and the cry of battle from the ships, grantthat he may return unharmed, with his armour and his comrades,fighters in close combat.""

ííííThus did he pray, and all-counselling Jove heard his prayer. Part ofit he did indeed vouchsafe him- but not the whole. He granted thatPatroclus should thrust back war and battle from the ships, butrefused to let him come safely out of the fight.

ííííWhen he had made his drink-offering and had thus prayed, Achilleswent inside his tent and put back the cup into his chest.

ííííThen he again came out, for he still loved to look upon the fiercefight that raged between the Trojans and Achaeans.

ííííMeanwhile the armed band that was about Patroclus marched on tillthey sprang high in hope upon the Trojans. They came swarming out likewasps whose nests are by the roadside, and whom silly children love totease, whereon any one who happens to be passing may get stung- oragain, if a wayfarer going along the road vexes them by accident,every wasp will come flying out in a fury to defend his little ones-even with such rage and courage did the Myrmidons swarm from theirships, and their cry of battle rose heavenwards. Patroclus calledout to his men at the top of his voice, ""Myrmidons, followers ofAchilles son of Peleus, be men my friends, fight with might and withmain, that we may win glory for the son of Peleus, who is far theforemost man at the ships of the Argives- he, and his close fightingfollowers. The son of Atreus King Agamemnon will thus learn hisfolly in showing no respect to the bravest of the Achaeans.""

ííííWith these words he put heart and soul into them all, and theyfell in a body upon the Trojans. The ships rang again with the crywhich the Achaeans raised, and when the Trojans saw the brave son ofMenoetius and his squire all gleaming in their armour, they weredaunted and their battalions were thrown into confusion, for theythought the fleet son of Peleus must now have put aside his anger, andhave been reconciled to Agamemnon; every one, therefore, lookedround about to see whither he might fly for safety.

ííííPatroclus first aimed a spear into the middle of the press where menwere packed most closely, by the stern of the ship of Protesilaus.He hit Pyraechmes who had led his Paeonian horsemen from the Amydonand the broad waters of the river Axius; the spear struck him on theright shoulder, and with a groan he fell backwards in the dust; onthis his men were thrown into confusion, for by killing theirleader, who was the finest soldier among them, Patroclus struckpanic into them all. He thus drove them from the ship and quenched thefire that was then blazing- leaving the half-burnt ship to lie whereit was. The Trojans were now driven back with a shout that rent theskies, while the Danaans poured after them from their ships,shouting also without ceasing. As when Jove, gatherer of thethunder-cloud, spreads a dense canopy on the top of some loftymountain, and all the peaks, the jutting headlands, and forestglades show out in the great light that flashes from the burstingheavens, even so when the Danaans had now driven back the fire fromtheir ships, they took breath for a little while; but the fury ofthe fight was not yet over, for the Trojans were not driven back inutter rout, but still gave battle, and were ousted from their groundonly by sheer fighting.

ííííThe fight then became more scattered, and the chieftains killedone another when and how they could. The valiant son of Menoetiusfirst drove his spear into the thigh of Areilycus just as he wasturning round; the point went clean through, and broke the bone sothat he fell forward. Meanwhile Menelaus struck Thoas in the chest,where it was exposed near the rim of his shield, and he fell dead. Theson of Phyleus saw Amphiclus about to attack him, and ere he coulddo so took aim at the upper part of his thigh, where the muscles arethicker than in any other part; the spear tore through all thesinews of the leg, and his eyes were closed in darkness. Of the sonsof Nestor one, Antilochus, speared Atymnius, driving the point ofthe spear through his throat, and down he fell. Maris then sprang onAntilochus in hand-to-hand fight to avenge his brother, and bestrodethe body spear in hand; but valiant Thrasymedes was too quick for him,and in a moment had struck him in the shoulder ere he could deal hisblow; his aim was true, and the spear severed all the muscles at theroot of his arm, and tore them right down to the bone, so he fellheavily to the ground and his eyes were closed in darkness. Thus didthese two noble comrades of Sarpedon go down to Erebus slain by thetwo sons of Nestor; they were the warrior sons of Amisodorus, whohad reared the invincible Chimaera, to the bane of many. Ajax son ofOileus sprang on Cleobulus and took him alive as he was entangled inthe crush; but he killed him then and there by a sword-blow on theneck. The sword reeked with his blood, while dark death and the stronghand of fate gripped him and closed his eyes.

ííííPeneleos and Lycon now met in close fight, for they had missedeach other with their spears. They had both thrown without effect,so now they drew their swords. Lycon struck the plumed crest ofPeneleos' helmet but his sword broke at the hilt, while Peneleos smoteLycon on the neck under the ear. The blade sank so deep that thehead was held on by nothing but the skin, and there was no more lifeleft in him. Meriones gave chase to Acamas on foot and caught him upjust as he was about to mount his chariot; he drove a spear throughhis right shoulder so that he fell headlong from the car, and his eyeswere closed in darkness. Idomeneus speared Erymas in the mouth; thebronze point of the spear went clean through it beneath the brain,crashing in among the white bones and smashing them up. His teeth wereall of them knocked out and the blood came gushing in a stream fromboth his eyes; it also came gurgling up from his mouth and nostrils,and the darkness of death enfolded him round about.

ííííThus did these chieftains of the Danaans each of them kill hisman. As ravening wolves seize on kids or lambs, fastening on them whenthey are alone on the hillsides and have strayed from the main flockthrough the carelessness of the shepherd- and when the wolves see thisthey pounce upon them at once because they cannot defend themselves-even so did the Danaans now fall on the Trojans, who fled withill-omened cries in their panic and had no more fight left in them.

ííííMeanwhile great Ajax kept on trying to drive a spear into Hector,but Hector was so skilful that he held his broad shoulders wellunder cover of his ox-hide shield, ever on the look-out for thewhizzing of the arrows and the heavy thud of the spears. He wellknew that the fortunes of the day had changed, but still stood hisground and tried to protect his comrades.

ííííAs when a cloud goes up into heaven from Olympus, rising out of aclear sky when Jove is brewing a gale- even with such panic strickenrout did the Trojans now fly, and there was no order in their going.Hector's fleet horses bore him and his armour out of the fight, and heleft the Trojan host penned in by the deep trench against theirwill. Many a yoke of horses snapped the pole of their chariots inthe trench and left their master's car behind them. Patroclus gavechase, calling impetuously on the Danaans and full of fury against theTrojans, who, being now no longer in a body, filled all the wayswith their cries of panic and rout; the air was darkened with theclouds of dust they raised, and the horses strained every nerve intheir flight from the tents and ships towards the city.

ííííPatroclus kept on heading his horses wherever he saw most men flyingin confusion, cheering on his men the while. Chariots were beingsmashed in all directions, and many a man came tumbling down fromhis own car to fall beneath the wheels of that of Patroclus, whoseimmortal steeds, given by the gods to Peleus, sprang over the trenchat a bound as they sped onward. He was intent on trying to get nearHector, for he had set his heart on spearing him, but Hector'shorses were now hurrying him away. As the whole dark earth bows beforesome tempest on an autumn day when Jove rains his hardest to punishmen for giving crooked judgement in their courts, and arriving justicetherefrom without heed to the decrees of heaven- all the rivers runfull and the torrents tear many a new channel as they roar headlongfrom the mountains to the dark sea, and it fares ill with the works ofmen- even such was the stress and strain of the Trojan horses in theirflight.

ííííPatroclus now cut off the battalions that were nearest to him anddrove them back to the ships. They were doing their best to reachthe city, but he would not Yet them, and bore down on them between theriver and the ships and wall. Many a fallen comrade did he thenavenge. First he hit Pronous with a spear on the chest where it wasexposed near the rim of his shield, and he fell heavily to the ground.Next he sprang on Thestor son of Enops, who was sitting all huddled upin his chariot, for he had lost his head and the reins had been tornout of his hands. Patroclus went up to him and drove a spear intohis right jaw; he thus hooked him by the teeth and the spear pulledhim over the rim of his car, as one who sits at the end of somejutting rock and draws a strong fish out of the sea with a hook anda line- even so with his spear did he pull Thestor all gaping from hischariot; he then threw him down on his face and he died while falling.On this, as Erylaus was on to attack him, he struck him full on thehead with a stone, and his brains were all battered inside his helmet,whereon he fell headlong to the ground and the pangs of death tookhold upon him. Then he laid low, one after the other, Erymas,Amphoterus, Epaltes, Tlepolemus, Echius son of Damastor, Pyris,lpheus, Euippus and Polymelus son of Argeas.

ííííNow when Sarpedon saw his comrades, men who wore ungirdled tunics,being overcome by Patroclus son of Menoetius, he rebuked the Lycianssaying. ""Shame on you, where are you flying to? Show your mettle; Iwill myself meet this man in fight and learn who it is that is somasterful; he has done us much hurt, and has stretched many a braveman upon the ground.""

ííííHe sprang from his chariot as he spoke, and Patroclus, when he sawthis, leaped on to the ground also. The two then rushed at one anotherwith loud cries like eagle-beaked crook-taloned vultures that screamand tear at one another in some high mountain fastness.

ííííThe son of scheming Saturn looked down upon them in pity and said toJuno who was his wife and sister, ""Alas, that it should be the lotof Sarpedon whom I love so dearly to perish by the hand ofPatroclus. I am in two minds whether to catch him up out of thefight and set him down safe and sound in the fertile land of Lycia, orto let him now fall by the hand of the son of Menoetius.""

ííííAnd Juno answered, ""Most dread son of Saturn, what is this thatyou are saying? Would you snatch a mortal man, whose doom has longbeen fated, out of the jaws of death? Do as you will, but we shall notall of us be of your mind. I say further, and lay my saying to yourheart, that if you send Sarpedon safely to his own home, some other ofthe gods will be also wanting to escort his son out of battle, forthere are many sons of gods fighting round the city of Troy, and youwill make every one jealous. If, however, you are fond of him and pityhim, let him indeed fall by the hand of Patroclus, but as soon asthe life is gone out of him, send Death and sweet Sleep to bear himoff the field and take him to the broad lands of Lycia, where hisbrothers and his kinsmen will bury him with mound and pillar, in duehonour to the dead.""

ííííThe sire of gods and men assented, but he shed a rain of bloodupon the earth in honour of his son whom Patroclus was about to killon the rich plain of Troy far from his home.

ííííWhen they were now come close to one another Patroclus struckThrasydemus, the brave squire of Sarpedon, in the lower part of thebelly, and killed him. Sarpedon then aimed a spear at Patroclus andmissed him, but he struck the horse Pedasus in the right shoulder, andit screamed aloud as it lay, groaning in the dust until the lifewent out of it. The other two horses began to plunge; the pole ofthe chariot cracked and they got entangled in the reins through thefall of the horse that was yoked along with them; but Automedon knewwhat to do; without the loss of a moment he drew the keen blade thathung by his sturdy thigh and cut the third horse adrift; whereon theother two righted themselves, and pulling hard at the reins again wenttogether into battle.

ííííSarpedon now took a second aim at Patroclus, and again missed him,the point of the spear passed over his left shoulder without hittinghim. Patroclus then aimed in his turn, and the spear sped not from hishand in vain, for he hit Sarpedon just where the midriff surrounds theever-beating heart. He fell like some oak or silver poplar or tallpine to which woodmen have laid their axes upon the mountains tomake timber for ship-building- even so did he lie stretched at fulllength in front of his chariot and horses, moaning and clutching atthe blood-stained dust. As when a lion springs with a bound upon aherd of cattle and fastens on a great black bull which diesbellowing in its clutches- even so did the leader of the Lycianwarriors struggle in death as he fell by the hand of Patroclus. Hecalled on his trusty comrade and said, ""Glaucus, my brother, heroamong heroes, put forth all your strength, fight with might andmain, now if ever quit yourself like a valiant soldier. First go aboutamong the Lycian captains and bid them fight for Sarpedon; thenyourself also do battle to save my armour from being taken. My namewill haunt you henceforth and for ever if the Achaeans rob me of myarmour now that I have fallen at their ships. Do your very utmostand call all my people together.""

ííííDeath closed his eyes as he spoke. Patroclus planted his heel on hisbreast and drew the spear from his body, whereon his senses came outalong with it, and he drew out both spear-point and Sarpedon's soul atthe same time. Hard by the Myrmidons held his snorting steeds, whowere wild with panic at finding themselves deserted by their lords.

ííííGlaucus was overcome with grief when he heard what Sarpedon said,for he could not help him. He had to support his arm with his otherhand, being in great pain through the wound which Teucer's arrow hadgiven him when Teucer was defending the wall as he, Glaucus, wasassailing it. Therefore he prayed to far-darting Apollo saying,""Hear me O king from your seat, may be in the rich land of Lycia, ormay be in Troy, for in all places you can hear the prayer of one whois in distress, as I now am. I have a grievous wound; my hand isaching with pain, there is no staunching the blood, and my whole armdrags by reason of my hurt, so that I cannot grasp my sword nor goamong my foes and fight them, thou our prince, Jove's son Sarpedon, isslain. Jove defended not his son, do you, therefore, O king, heal meof my wound, ease my pain and grant me strength both to cheer on theLycians and to fight along with them round the body of him who hasfallen.""

ííííThus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He eased his pain,staunched the black blood from the wound, and gave him new strength.Glaucus perceived this, and was thankful that the mighty god hadanswered his prayer; forthwith, therefore, he went among the Lyciancaptains, and bade them come to fight about the body of Sarpedon. Fromthese he strode on among the Trojans to Polydamas son of Panthousand Agenor; he then went in search of Aeneas and Hector, and when hehad found them he said, ""Hector, you have utterly forgotten yourallies, who languish here for your sake far from friends and homewhile you do nothing to support them. Sarpedon leader of the Lycianwarriors has fallen- he who was at once the right and might ofLycia; Mars has laid him low by the spear of Patroclus. Stand byhim, my friends, and suffer not the Myrmidons to strip him of hisarmour, nor to treat his body with contumely in revenge for all theDanaans whom we have speared at the ships.""

ííííAs he spoke the Trojans were plunged in extreme and ungovernablegrief; for Sarpedon, alien though he was, had been one of the mainstays of their city, both as having much people with him, andhimself the foremost among them all. Led by Hector, who was infuriatedby the fall of Sarpedon, they made instantly for the Danaans withall their might, while the undaunted spirit of Patroclus son ofMenoetius cheered on the Achaeans. First he spoke to the two Ajaxes,men who needed no bidding. ""Ajaxes,"" said he, ""may it now please youto show youselves the men you have always been, or even better-Sarpedon is fallen- he who was first to overleap the wall of theAchaeans; let us take the body and outrage it; let us strip the armourfrom his shoulders, and kill his comrades if they try to rescue hisbody.""

ííííHe spoke to men who of themselves were full eager; both sides,therefore, the Trojans and Lycians on the one hand, and theMyrmidons and Achaeans on the other, strengthened their battalions,and fought desperately about the body of Sarpedon, shouting fiercelythe while. Mighty was the din of their armour as they came together,and Jove shed a thick darkness over the fight, to increase the ofthe battle over the body of his son.

ííííAt first the Trojans made some headway against the Achaeans, for oneof the best men among the Myrmidons was killed, Epeigeus, son of nobleAgacles who had erewhile been king in the good city of Budeum; butpresently, having killed a valiant kinsman of his own, he tookrefuge with Peleus and Thetis, who sent him to Ilius the land of noblesteeds to fight the Trojans under Achilles. Hector now struck him onthe head with a stone just as he had caught hold of the body, andhis brains inside his helmet were all battered in, so that he fellface foremost upon the body of Sarpedon, and there died. Patroclus wasenraged by the death of his comrade, and sped through the frontranks as swiftly as a hawk that swoops down on a flock of daws orstarlings. Even so swiftly, O noble knight Patroclus, did you makestraight for the Lycians and Trojans to avenge your comrade. Forthwithhe struck Sthenelaus the son of Ithaemenes on the neck with a stone,and broke the tendons that join it to the head and spine. On thisHector and the front rank of his men gave ground. As far as a mancan throw a javelin when competing for some prize, or even inbattle- so far did the Trojans now retreat before the Achaeans.Glaucus, captain of the Lycians, was the first to rally them, bykilling Bathycles son of Chalcon who lived in Hellas and was therichest man among the Myrmidons. Glaucus turned round suddenly, justas Bathycles who was pursuing him was about to lay hold of him, anddrove his spear right into the middle of his chest, whereon he fellheavily to the ground, and the fall of so good a man filled theAchaeans with dismay, while the Trojans were exultant, and came upin a body round the corpse. Nevertheless the Achaeans, mindful oftheir prowess, bore straight down upon them.

ííííMeriones then killed a helmed warrior of the Trojans, Laogonus sonof Onetor, who was priest of Jove of Mt. Ida, and was honoured bythe people as though he were a god. Meriones struck him under thejaw and ear, so that life went out of him and the darkness of deathlaid hold upon him. Aeneas then aimed a spear at Meriones, hoping tohit him under the shield as he was advancing, but Meriones saw itcoming and stooped forward to avoid it, whereon the spear flew pasthim and the point stuck in the ground, while the butt-end went onquivering till Mars robbed it of its force. The spear, therefore, spedfrom Aeneas's hand in vain and fell quivering to the ground. Aeneaswas angry and said, ""Meriones, you are a good dancer, but if I had hityou my spear would soon have made an end of you.""

ííííAnd Meriones answered, ""Aeneas, for all your bravery, you will notbe able to make an end of every one who comes against you. You areonly a mortal like myself, and if I were to hit you in the middle ofyour shield with my spear, however strong and self-confident you maybe, I should soon vanquish you, and you would yield your life to Hadesof the noble steeds.""

ííííOn this the son of Menoetius rebuked him and said, ""Meriones, herothough you be, you should not speak thus; taunting speeches, my goodfriend, will not make the Trojans draw away from the dead body; someof them must go under ground first; blows for battle, and words forcouncil; fight, therefore, and say nothing.""

ííííHe led the way as he spoke and the hero went forward with him. Asthe sound of woodcutters in some forest glade upon the mountains-and the thud of their axes is heard afar- even such a din now rosefrom earth-clash of bronze armour and of good ox-hide shields, asmen smote each other with their swords and spears pointed at bothends. A man had need of good eyesight now to know Sarpedon, so coveredwas he from head to foot with spears and blood and dust. Men swarmedabout the body, as flies that buzz round the full milk-pails in springwhen they are brimming with milk- even so did they gather roundSarpedon; nor did Jove turn his keen eyes away for one moment from thefight, but kept looking at it all the time, for he was settling howbest to kill Patroclus, and considering whether Hector should beallowed to end him now in the fight round the body of Sarpedon, andstrip him of his armour, or whether he should let him give yet furthertrouble to the Trojans. In the end, he deemed it best that the bravesquire of Achilles son of Peleus should drive Hector and the Trojansback towards the city and take the lives of many. First, therefore, hemade Hector turn fainthearted, whereon he mounted his chariot andfled, bidding the other Trojans fly also, for he saw that the scalesof Jove had turned against him. Neither would the brave Lyciansstand firm; they were dismayed when they saw their king lying struckto the heart amid a heap of corpses- for when the son of Saturn madethe fight wax hot many had fallen above him. The Achaeans, thereforestripped the gleaming armour from his shoulders and the brave son ofMenoetius gave it to his men to take to the ships. Then Jove lord ofthe storm-cloud said to Apollo, ""Dear Phoebus, go, I pray you, andtake Sarpedon out of range of the weapons; cleanse the black bloodfrom off him, and then bear him a long way off where you may washhim in the river, anoint him with ambrosia, and clothe him in immortalraiment; this done, commit him to the arms of the two fleetmessengers, Death, and Sleep, who will carry him straightway to therich land of Lycia, where his brothers and kinsmen will inter him, andwill raise both mound and pillar to his memory, in due honour to thedead.""

ííííThus he spoke. Apollo obeyed his father's saying, and came down fromthe heights of Ida into the thick of the fight; forthwith he tookSarpedon out of range of the weapons, and then bore him a long wayoff, where he washed him in the river, anointed him with ambrosiaand clothed him in immortal raiment; this done, he committed him tothe arms of the two fleet messengers, Death, and Sleep, whopresently set him down in the rich land of Lycia.

ííííMeanwhile Patroclus, with many a shout to his horses and toAutomedon, pursued the Trojans and Lycians in the pride andfoolishness of his heart. Had he but obeyed the bidding of the sonof Peleus, he would have, escaped death and have been scatheless;but the counsels of Jove pass man's understanding; he will put evena brave man to flight and snatch victory from his grasp, or again hewill set him on to fight, as he now did when he put a high spirit intothe heart of Patroclus.

ííííWho then first, and who last, was slain by you, O Patroclus, whenthe gods had now called you to meet your doom? First Adrestus,Autonous, Echeclus, Perimus the son of Megas, Epistor andMelanippus; after these he killed Elasus, Mulius, and Pylartes.These he slew, but the rest saved themselves by flight.

ííííThe sons of the Achaeans would now have taken Troy by the hands ofPatroclus, for his spear flew in all directions, had not PhoebusApollo taken his stand upon the wall to defeat his purpose and toaid the Trojans. Thrice did Patroclus charge at an angle of the highwall, and thrice did Apollo beat him back, striking his shield withhis own immortal hands. When Patroclus was coming on like a god foryet a fourth time, Apollo shouted to him with an awful voice and said,""Draw back, noble Patroclus, it is not your lot to sack the city ofthe Trojan chieftains, nor yet will it be that of Achilles who is afar better man than you are."" On hearing this, Patroclus withdrew tosome distance and avoided the anger of Apollo.

ííííMeanwhile Hector was waiting with his horses inside the Scaeangates, in doubt whether to drive out again and go on fighting, or tocall the army inside the gates. As he was thus doubting Phoebus Apollodrew near him in the likeness of a young and lusty warrior Asius,who was Hector's uncle, being own brother to Hecuba, and son ofDymas who lived in Phrygia by the waters of the river Sangarius; inhis likeness Jove's son Apollo now spoke to Hector saying, ""Hector,why have you left off fighting? It is ill done of you. If I were asmuch better a man than you, as I am worse, you should soon rue yourslackness. Drive straight towards Patroclus, if so be that Apollomay grant you a triumph over him, and you may rull him.""

ííííWith this the god went back into the hurly-burly, and Hector badeCebriones drive again into the fight. Apollo passed in among them, andstruck panic into the Argives, while he gave triumph to Hector and theTrojans. Hector let the other Danaans alone and killed no man, butdrove straight at Patroclus. Patroclus then sprang from his chariot tothe ground, with a spear in his left hand, and in his right a jaggedstone as large as his hand could hold. He stood still and threw it,nor did it go far without hitting some one; the cast was not invain, for the stone struck Cebriones, Hector's charioteer, a bastardson of Priam, as he held the reins in his hands. The stone hit himon the forehead and drove his brows into his head for the bone wassmashed, and his eyes fell to the ground at his feet. He droppeddead from his chariot as though he were diving, and there was nomore life left in him. Over him did you then vaunt, O knightPatroclus, saying, ""Bless my heart, how active he is, and how wellhe dives. If we had been at sea this fellow would have dived fromthe ship's side and brought up as many oysters as the whole crew couldstomach, even in rough water, for he has dived beautifully off hischariot on to the ground. It seems, then, that there are divers alsoamong the Trojans.""

ííííAs he spoke he flung himself on Cebriones with the spring, as itwere, of a lion that while attacking a stockyard is himself struckin the chest, and his courage is his own bane- even so furiously, OPatroclus, did you then spring upon Cebriones. Hector sprang also fromhis chariot to the ground. The pair then fought over the body ofCebriones. As two lions fight fiercely on some high mountain overthe body of a stag that they have killed, even so did these two mightywarriors, Patroclus son of Menoetius and brave Hector, hack and hew atone another over the corpse of Cebriones. Hector would not let himgo when he had once got him by the head, while Patroclus kept fasthold of his feet, and a fierce fight raged between the other Danaansand Trojans. As the east and south wind buffet one another when theybeat upon some dense forest on the mountains- there is beech and ashand spreading cornel; the to of the trees roar as they beat on oneanother, and one can hear the boughs cracking and breaking- even sodid the Trojans and Achaeans spring upon one another and lay abouteach other, and neither side would give way. Many a pointed spear fellto ground and many a winged arrow sped from its bow-string about thebody of Cebriones; many a great stone, moreover, beat on many a shieldas they fought around his body, but there he lay in the whirlingclouds of dust, all huge and hugely, heedless of his driving now.

ííííSo long as the sun was still high in mid-heaven the weapons ofeither side were alike deadly, and the people fell; but when he wentdown towards the time when men loose their oxen, the Achaeans provedto be beyond all forecast stronger, so that they drew Cebriones out ofrange of the darts and tumult of the Trojans, and stripped thearmour from his shoulders. Then Patroclus sprang like Mars with fierceintent and a terrific shout upon the Trojans, and thrice did he killnine men; but as he was coming on like a god for a time, then, OPatroclus, was the hour of your end approaching, for Phoebus foughtyou in fell earnest. Patroclus did not see him as he moved about inthe crush, for he was enshrouded in thick darkness, and the god struckhim from behind on his back and his broad shoulders with the flat ofhis hand, so that his eyes turned dizzy. Phoebus Apollo beat thehelmet from off his head, and it rolled rattling off under the horses'feet, where its horse-hair plumes were all begrimed with dust andblood. Never indeed had that helmet fared so before, for it had servedto protect the head and comely forehead of the godlike heroAchilles. Now, however, Zeus delivered it over to be worn by Hector.Nevertheless the end of Hector also was near. The bronze-shod spear,so great and so strong, was broken in the hand of Patroclus, while hisshield that covered him from head to foot fell to the ground as didalso the band that held it, and Apollo undid the fastenings of hiscorslet.

ííííOn this his mind became clouded; his limbs failed him, and hestood as one dazed; whereon Euphorbus son of Panthous a Dardanian, thebest spearman of his time, as also the finest horseman and fleetestrunner, came behind him and struck him in the back with a spear,midway between the shoulders. This man as soon as ever he had comeup with his chariot had dismounted twenty men, so proficient was he inall the arts of war- he it was, O knight Patroclus, that first drove aweapon into you, but he did not quite overpower you. Euphorbus thenran back into the crowd, after drawing his ashen spear out of thewound; he would not stand firm and wait for Patroclus, unarmedthough he now was, to attack him; but Patroclus unnerved, alike by theblow the god had given him and by the spear-wound, drew back undercover of his men in fear for his life. Hector on this, seeing him tobe wounded and giving ground, forced his way through the ranks, andwhen close up with him struck him in the lower part of the bellywith a spear, driving the bronze point right through it, so that hefell heavily to the ground to the great of the Achaeans. As when alion has fought some fierce wild-boar and worsted him- the two fightfuriously upon the mountains over some little fountain at which theywould both drink, and the lion has beaten the boar till he canhardly breathe- even so did Hector son of Priam take the life of thebrave son of Menoetius who had killed so many, striking him from closeat hand, and vaunting over him the while. ""Patroclus,"" said he, ""youdeemed that you should sack our city, rob our Trojan women of theirfreedom, and carry them off in your ships to your own country. Fool;Hector and his fleet horses were ever straining their utmost to defendthem. I am foremost of all the Trojan warriors to stave the day ofbondage from off them; as for you, vultures shall devour you here.Poor wretch, Achilles with all his bravery availed you nothing; andyet I ween when you left him he charged you straitly saying, 'Come notback to the ships, knight Patroclus, till you have rent thebloodstained shirt of murderous Hector about his body. Thus I ween didhe charge you, and your fool's heart answered him 'yea' within you.""

ííííThen, as the life ebbed out of you, you answered, O knightPatroclus: ""Hector, vaunt as you will, for Jove the son of Saturnand Apollo have vouchsafed you victory; it is they who have vanquishedme so easily, and they who have stripped the armour from my shoulders;had twenty such men as you attacked me, all of them would havefallen before my spear. Fate and the son of Leto have overpoweredme, and among mortal men Euphorbus; you are yourself third only in thekilling of me. I say further, and lay my saying to your heart, you tooshall live but for a little season; death and the day of your doom areclose upon you, and they will lay you low by the hand of Achillesson of Aeacus.""

ííííWhen he had thus spoken his eyes were closed in death, his soul lefthis body and flitted down to the house of Hades, mourning its sad fateand bidding farewell to the youth and vigor of its manhood. Deadthough he was, Hector still spoke to him saying, ""Patroclus, whyshould you thus foretell my doom? Who knows but Achilles, son oflovely Thetis, may be smitten by my spear and die before me?""

ííííAs he spoke he drew the bronze spear from the wound, planting hisfoot upon the body, which he thrust off and let lie on its back. Hethen went spear in hand after Automedon, squire of the fleetdescendant of Aeacus, for he longed to lay him low, but the immortalsteeds which the gods had given as a rich gift to Peleus bore himswiftly from the field.

ííííBOOK XVII

ííííBRAVE Menelaus son of Atreus now came to know that Patroclus hadfallen, and made his way through the front ranks clad in full armourto bestride him. As a cow stands lowing over her first calf, even sodid yellow-haired Menelaus bestride Patroclus. He held his roundshield and his spear in front of him, resolute to kill any whoshould dare face him. But the son of Panthous had also noted the body,and came up to Menelaus saying, ""Menelaus, son of Atreus, draw back,leave the body, and let the bloodstained spoils be. I was first of theTrojans and their brave allies to drive my spear into Patroclus, letme, therefore, have my full glory among the Trojans, or I will takeaim and kill you.""

ííííTo this Menelaus answered in great anger ""By father Jove, boastingis an ill thing. The pard is not more bold, nor the lion nor savagewild-boar, which is fiercest and most dauntless of all creatures, thanare the proud sons of Panthous. Yet Hyperenor did not see out the daysof his youth when he made light of me and withstood me, deeming me themeanest soldier among the Danaans. His own feet never bore him back togladden his wife and parents. Even so shall I make an end of youtoo, if you withstand me; get you back into the crowd and do notface me, or it shall be worse for you. Even a fool may be wise afterthe event.""

ííííEuphorbus would not listen, and said, ""Now indeed, Menelaus, shallyou pay for the death of my brother over whom you vaunted, and whosewife you widowed in her bridal chamber, while you brought griefunspeakable on his parents. I shall comfort these poor people if Ibring your head and armour and place them in the hands of Panthous andnoble Phrontis. The time is come when this matter shall be foughtout and settled, for me or against me.""

ííííAs he spoke he struck Menelaus full on the shield, but the spear didnot go through, for the shield turned its point. Menelaus then tookaim, praying to father Jove as he did so; Euphorbus was drawingback, and Menelaus struck him about the roots of his throat, leaninghis whole weight on the spear, so as to drive it home. The pointwent clean through his neck, and his armour rang rattling round him ashe fell heavily to the ground. His hair which was like that of theGraces, and his locks so deftly bound in bands of silver and gold,were all bedrabbled with blood. As one who has grown a fine youngolive tree in a clear space where there is abundance of water- theplant is full of promise, and though the winds beat upon it from everyquarter it puts forth its white blossoms till the blasts of somefierce hurricane sweep down upon it and level it with the ground- evenso did Menelaus strip the fair youth Euphorbus of his armour afterhe had slain him. Or as some fierce lion upon the mountains in thepride of his strength fastens on the finest heifer in a herd as itis feeding- first he breaks her neck with his strong jaws, and thengorges on her blood and entrails; dogs and shepherds raise a hue andcry against him, but they stand aloof and will not come close tohim, for they are pale with fear- even so no one had the courage toface valiant Menelaus. The son of Atreus would have then carried offthe armour of the son of Panthous with ease, had not Phoebus Apollobeen angry, and in the guise of Mentes chief of the Cicons incitedHector to attack him. ""Hector,"" said he, ""you are now going afterthe horses of the noble son of Aeacus, but you will not take them;they cannot be kept in hand and driven by mortal man, save only byAchilles, who is son to an immortal mother. Meanwhile Menelaus sonof Atreus has bestridden the body of Patroclus and killed thenoblest of the Trojans, Euphorbus son of Panthous, so that he canfight no more.""

ííííThe god then went back into the toil and turmoil, but the soul ofHector was darkened with a cloud of grief; he looked along the ranksand saw Euphorbus lying on the ground with the blood still flowingfrom his wound, and Menelaus stripping him of his armour. On this hemade his way to the front like a flame of fire, clad in his gleamingarmour, and crying with a loud voice. When the son of Atreus heardhim, he said to himself in his dismay, ""Alas! what shall I do? I maynot let the Trojans take the armour of Patroclus who has fallenfighting on my behalf, lest some Danaan who sees me should cry shameupon me. Still if for my honour's sake I fight Hector and theTrojans single-handed, they will prove too many for me, for Hectoris bringing them up in force. Why, however, should I thus hesitate?When a man fights in despite of heaven with one whom a godbefriends, he will soon rue it. Let no Danaan think ill of me if Igive place to Hector, for the hand of heaven is with him. Yet, if Icould find Ajax, the two of us would fight Hector and heaven too, ifwe might only save the body of Patroclus for Achilles son of Peleus.This, of many evils would be the least.""

ííííWhile he was thus in two minds, the Trojans came up to him withHector at their head; he therefore drew back and left the body,turning about like some bearded lion who is being chased by dogs andmen from a stockyard with spears and hue and cry, whereon he isdaunted and slinks sulkily off- even so did Menelaus son of Atreusturn and leave the body of Patroclus. When among the body of hismen, he looked around for mighty Ajax son of Telamon, and presentlysaw him on the extreme left of the fight, cheering on his men andexhorting them to keep on fighting, for Phoebus Apollo had spread agreat panic among them. He ran up to him and said, ""Ajax, my goodfriend, come with me at once to dead Patroclus, if so be that we maytake the body to Achilles- as for his armour, Hector already has it.""

ííííThese words stirred the heart of Ajax, and he made his way among thefront ranks, Menelaus going with him. Hector had stripped Patroclus ofhis armour, and was dragging him away to cut off his head and take thebody to fling before the dogs of Troy. But Ajax came up with hisshield like wall before him, on which Hector withdrew under shelter ofhis men, and sprang on to his chariot, giving the armour over to theTrojans to take to the city, as a great trophy for himself; Ajax,therefore, covered the body of Patroclus with his broad shield andbestrode him; as a lion stands over his whelps if hunters have comeupon him in a forest when he is with his little ones- in the pride andfierceness of his strength he draws his knit brows down till theycover his eyes- even so did Ajax bestride the body of Patroclus, andby his side stood Menelaus son of Atreus, nursing great sorrow inhis heart.

ííííThen Glaucus son of Hippolochus looked fiercely at Hector andrebuked him sternly. ""Hector,"" said he, ""you make a brave show, but infight you are sadly wanting. A runaway like yourself has no claim toso great a reputation. Think how you may now save your town andcitadel by the hands of your own people born in Ilius; for you willget no Lycians to fight for you, seeing what thanks they have hadfor their incessant hardships. Are you likely, sir, to do anythingto help a man of less note, after leaving Sarpedon, who was at onceyour guest and comrade in arms, to be the spoil and prey of theDanaans? So long as he lived he did good service both to your city andyourself; yet you had no stomach to save his body from the dogs. Ifthe Lycians will listen to me, they will go home and leave Troy to itsfate. If the Trojans had any of that daring fearless spirit which layshold of men who are fighting for their country and harassing those whowould attack it, we should soon bear off Patroclus into Ilius. Couldwe get this dead man away and bring him into the city of Priam, theArgives would readily give up the armour of Sarpedon, and we shouldget his body to boot. For he whose squire has been now killed is theforemost man at the ships of the Achaeans- he and his close-fightingfollowers. Nevertheless you dared not make a stand against Ajax, norface him, eye to eye, with battle all round you, for he is a braverman than you are.""

ííííHector scowled at him and answered, ""Glaucus, you should knowbetter. I have held you so far as a man of more understanding than anyin all Lycia, but now I despise you for saying that I am afraid ofAjax. I fear neither battle nor the din of chariots, but Jove's willis stronger than ours; Jove at one time makes even a strong man drawback and snatches victory from his grasp, while at another he will sethim on to fight. Come hither then, my friend, stand by me and seeindeed whether I shall play the coward the whole day through as yousay, or whether I shall not stay some even of the boldest Danaans fromfighting round the body of Patroclus.""

ííííAs he spoke he called loudly on the Trojans saying, ""Trojans,Lycians, and Dardanians, fighters in close combat, be men, my friends,and fight might and main, while I put on the goodly armour ofAchilles, which I took when I killed Patroclus.""

ííííWith this Hector left the fight, and ran full speed after his menwho were taking the armour of Achilles to Troy, but had not yet gotfar. Standing for a while apart from the woeful fight, he changedhis armour. His own he sent to the strong city of Ilius and to theTrojans, while he put on the immortal armour of the son of Peleus,which the gods had given to Peleus, who in his age gave it to his son;but the son did not grow old in his father's armour.

ííííWhen Jove, lord of the storm-cloud, saw Hector standing aloof andarming himself in the armour of the son of Peleus, he wagged hishead and muttered to himself saying, ""A! poor wretch, you arm in thearmour of a hero, before whom many another trembles, and you recknothing of the doom that is already close upon you. You have killedhis comrade so brave and strong, but it was not well that you shouldstrip the armour from his head and shoulders. I do indeed endow youwith great might now, but as against this you shall not return frombattle to lay the armour of the son of Peleus before Andromache.""

ííííThe son of Saturn bowed his portentous brows, and Hector fittedthe armour to his body, while terrible Mars entered into him, andfilled his whole body with might and valour. With a shout he strode inamong the allies, and his armour flashed about him so that he seemedto all of them like the great son of Peleus himself. He went aboutamong them and cheered them on- Mesthles, Glaucus, Medon,Thersilochus, Asteropaeus, Deisenor and Hippothous, Phorcys,Chromius and Ennomus the augur. All these did he exhort saying,""Hear me, allies from other cities who are here in your thousands,it was not in order to have a crowd about me that I called youhither each from his several city, but that with heart and soul youmight defend the wives and little ones of the Trojans from thefierce Achaeans. For this do I oppress my people with your food andthe presents that make you rich. Therefore turn, and charge at thefoe, to stand or fall as is the game of war; whoever shall bringPatroclus, dead though he be, into the hands of the Trojans, and shallmake Ajax give way before him, I will give him one half of thespoils while I keep the other. He will thus share like honour withmyself.""

ííííWhen he had thus spoken they charged full weight upon the Danaanswith their spears held out before them, and the hopes of each ran highthat he should force Ajax son of Telamon to yield up the body- foolsthat they were, for he was about to take the lives of many. ThenAjax said to Menelaus, ""My good friend Menelaus, you and I shallhardly come out of this fight alive. I am less concerned for thebody of Patroclus, who will shortly become meat for the dogs andvultures of Troy, than for the safety of my own head and yours. Hectorhas wrapped us round in a storm of battle from every quarter, andour destruction seems now certain. Call then upon the princes of theDanaans if there is any who can hear us.""

ííííMenelaus did as he said, and shouted to the Danaans for help atthe top of his voice. ""My friends,"" he cried, ""princes and counsellorsof the Argives, all you who with Agamemnon and Menelaus drink at thepublic cost, and give orders each to his own people as Jove vouchsafeshim power and glory, the fight is so thick about me that I cannotdistinguish you severally; come on, therefore, every man unbidden, andthink it shame that Patroclus should become meat and morsel for Trojanhounds.""

ííííFleet Ajax son of Oileus heard him and was first to force his waythrough the fight and run to help him. Next came Idomeneus andMeriones his esquire, peer of murderous Mars. As for the others thatcame into the fight after these, who of his own self could name them?

ííííThe Trojans with Hector at their head charged in a body. As agreat wave that comes thundering in at the mouth of some heaven-bornriver, and the rocks that jut into the sea ring with the roar of thebreakers that beat and buffet them- even with such a roar did theTrojans come on; but the Achaeans in singleness of heart stood firmabout the son of Menoetius, and fenced him with their bronzeshields. Jove, moreover, hid the brightness of their helmets in athick cloud, for he had borne no grudge against the son of Menoetiuswhile he was still alive and squire to the descendant of Aeacus;therefore he was loth to let him fall a prey to the dogs of his foesthe Trojans, and urged his comrades on to defend him.

ííííAt first the Trojans drove the Achaeans back, and they withdrew fromthe dead man daunted. The Trojans did not succeed in killing anyone, nevertheless they drew the body away. But the Achaeans did notlose it long, for Ajax, foremost of all the Danaans after the son ofPeleus alike in stature and prowess, quickly rallied them and madetowards the front like a wild boar upon the mountains when he standsat bay in the forest glades and routs the hounds and lusty youths thathave attacked him- even so did Ajax son of Telamon passing easily inamong the phalanxes of the Trojans, disperse those who hadbestridden Patroclus and were most bent on winning glory by dragginghim off to their city. At this moment Hippothous brave son of thePelasgian Lethus, in his zeal for Hector and the Trojans, was draggingthe body off by the foot through the press of the fight, havingbound a strap round the sinews near the ancle; but a mischief soonbefell him from which none of those could save him who would havegladly done so, for the son of Telamon sprang forward and smote him onhis bronze-cheeked helmet. The plumed headpiece broke about thepoint of the weapon, struck at once by the spear and by the stronghand of Ajax, so that the bloody brain came oozing out through thecrest-socket. His strength then failed him and he let Patroclus'foot drop from his hand, as he fell full length dead upon the body;thus he died far from the fertile land of Larissa, and never repaidhis parents the cost of bringing him up, for his life was cut shortearly by the spear of mighty Ajax. Hector then took aim at Ajax with aspear, but he saw it coming and just managed to avoid it; the spearpassed on and struck Schedius son of noble Iphitus, captain of thePhoceans, who dwelt in famed Panopeus and reigned over much people; itstruck him under the middle of the collar-bone the bronze point wentright through him, coming out at the bottom of his shoulder-blade, andhis armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.Ajax in his turn struck noble Phorcys son of Phaenops in the middle ofthe belly as he was bestriding Hippothous, and broke the plate ofhis cuirass; whereon the spear tore out his entrails and he clutchedthe ground in his palm as he fell to earth. Hector and those whowere in the front rank then gave ground, while the Argives raised aloud cry of triumph, and drew off the bodies of Phorcys and Hippothouswhich they stripped presently of their armour.

ííííThe Trojans would now have been worsted by the brave Achaeans anddriven back to Ilius through their own cowardice, while the Argives,so great was their courage and endurance, would have achieved atriumph even against the will of Jove, if Apollo had not rousedAeneas, in the likeness of Periphas son of Epytus, an attendant whohad grown old in the service of Aeneas' aged father, and was at alltimes devoted to him. In his likeness, then, Apollo said, ""Aeneas, canyou not manage, even though heaven be against us, to save highIlius? I have known men, whose numbers, courage, and self-reliancehave saved their people in spite of Jove, whereas in this case hewould much rather give victory to us than to the Danaans, if you wouldonly fight instead of being so terribly afraid.""

ííííAeneas knew Apollo when he looked straight at him, and shouted toHector saying, ""Hector and all other Trojans and allies, shame on usif we are beaten by the Achaeans and driven back to Ilius throughour own cowardice. A god has just come up to me and told me thatJove the supreme disposer will be with us. Therefore let us make forthe Danaans, that it may go hard with them ere they bear away deadPatroclus to the ships.""

ííííAs he spoke he sprang out far in front of the others, who thenrallied and again faced the Achaeans. Aeneas speared Leiocritus son ofArisbas, a valiant follower of Lycomedes, and Lycomedes was moved withpity as he saw him fall; he therefore went close up, and spearedApisaon son of Hippasus shepherd of his people in the liver underthe midriff, so that he died; he had come from fertile Paeonia and wasthe best man of them all after Asteropaeus. Asteropaeus flew forwardto avenge him and attack the Danaans, but this might no longer be,inasmuch as those about Patroclus were well covered by theirshields, and held their spears in front of them, for Ajax had giventhem strict orders that no man was either to give ground, or tostand out before the others, but all were to hold well togetherabout the body and fight hand to hand. Thus did huge Ajax bid them,and the earth ran red with blood as the corpses fell thick on oneanother alike on the side of the Trojans and allies, and on that ofthe Danaans; for these last, too, fought no bloodless fight thoughmany fewer of them perished, through the care they took to defendand stand by one another.

ííííThus did they fight as it were a flaming fire; it seemed as thoughit had gone hard even with the sun and moon, for they were hidden overall that part where the bravest heroes were fighting about the deadson of Menoetius, whereas the other Danaans and Achaeans fought attheir ease in full daylight with brilliant sunshine all round them,and there was not a cloud to be seen neither on plain nor mountain.These last moreover would rest for a while and leave off fighting, forthey were some distance apart and beyond the range of one another'sweapons, whereas those who were in the thick of the fray suffered bothfrom battle and darkness. All the best of them were being worn outby the great weight of their armour, but the two valiant heroes,Thrasymedes and Antilochus, had not yet heard of the death ofPatroclus, and believed him to be still alive and leading the vanagainst the Trojans; they were keeping themselves in reserve againstthe death or rout of their own comrades, for so Nestor had orderedwhen he sent them from the ships into battle.

ííííThus through the livelong day did they wage fierce war, and thesweat of their toil rained ever on their legs under them, and on theirhands and eyes, as they fought over the squire of the fleet son ofPeleus. It was as when a man gives a great ox-hide all drenched in fatto his men, and bids them stretch it; whereon they stand round it in aring and tug till the moisture leaves it, and the fat soaks in for themany that pull at it, and it is well stretched- even so did the twosides tug the dead body hither and thither within the compass of but alittle space- the Trojans steadfastly set on drag ing it into Ilius,while the Achaeans were no less so on taking it to their ships; andfierce was the fight between them. Not Mars himself the lord of hosts,nor yet Minerva, even in their fullest fury could make light of such abattle.

ííííSuch fearful turmoil of men and horses did Jove on that day ordainround the body of Patroclus. Meanwhile Achilles did not know that hehad fallen, for the fight was under the wall of Troy a long way offthe ships. He had no idea, therefore, that Patroclus was dead, anddeemed that he would return alive as soon as he had gone close up tothe gates. He knew that he was not to sack the city neither with norwithout himself, for his mother had often told him this when he hadsat alone with her, and she had informed him of the counsels ofgreat Jove. Now, however, she had not told him how great a disasterhad befallen him in the death of the one who was far dearest to him ofall his comrades.

ííííThe others still kept on charging one another round the body withtheir pointed spears and killing each other. Then would one say, ""Myfriends, we can never again show our faces at the ships- better, andgreatly better, that earth should open and swallow us here in thisplace, than that we should let the Trojans have the triumph of bearingoff Patroclus to their city.""

ííííThe Trojans also on their part spoke to one another saying,""Friends, though we fall to a man beside this body, let none shrinkfrom fighting."" With such words did they exhort each other. Theyfought and fought, and an iron clank rose through the void air tothe brazen vault of heaven. The horses of the descendant of Aeacusstood out of the fight and wept when they heard that their driverhad been laid low by the hand of murderous Hector. Automedon,valiant son of Diores, lashed them again and again; many a time did hespeak kindly to them, and many a time did he upbraid them, but theywould neither go back to the ships by the waters of the broadHellespont, nor yet into battle among the Achaeans; they stood withtheir chariot stock still, as a pillar set over the tomb of somedead man or woman, and bowed their heads to the ground. Hot tears fellfrom their eyes as they mourned the loss of their charioteer, andtheir noble manes drooped all wet from under the yokestraps oneither side the yoke.

ííííThe son of Saturn saw them and took pity upon their sorrow. Hewagged his head, and muttered to himself, saying, ""Poor things, whydid we give you to King Peleus who is a mortal, while you areyourselves ageless and immortal? Was it that you might share thesorrows that befall mankind? for of all creatures that live and moveupon the earth there is none so pitiable as he is- still, Hector sonof Priam shall drive neither you nor your chariot. I will not have it.It is enough that he should have the armour over which he vaunts sovainly. Furthermore I will give you strength of heart and limb to bearAutomedon safely to the ships from battle, for I shall let the Trojanstriumph still further, and go on killing till they reach the ships;whereon night shall fall and darkness overshadow the land.""

ííííAs he spoke he breathed heart and strength into the horses so thatthey shook the dust from out of their manes, and bore their chariotswiftly into the fight that raged between Trojans and Achaeans. Behindthem fought Automedon full of sorrow for his comrade, as a vultureamid a flock of geese. In and out, and here and there, full speed hedashed amid the throng of the Trojans, but for all the fury of hispursuit he killed no man, for he could not wield his spear and keephis horses in hand when alone in the chariot; at last, however, acomrade, Alcimedon, son of Laerces son of Haemon caught sight of himand came up behind his chariot. ""Automedon,"" said he, ""what god hasput this folly into your heart and robbed you of your right mind, thatyou fight the Trojans in the front rank single-handed? He who was yourcomrade is slain, and Hector plumes himself on being armed in thearmour of the descendant of Aeacus.""

ííííAutomedon son of Diores answered, ""Alcimedon, there is no one elsewho can control and guide the immortal steeds so well as you can, saveonly Patroclus- while he was alive- peer of gods in counsel. Take thenthe whip and reins, while I go down from the car and fight.

ííííAlcimedon sprang on to the chariot, and caught up the whip andreins, while Automedon leaped from off the car. When Hector saw him hesaid to Aeneas who was near him, ""Aeneas, counsellor of themail-clad Trojans, I see the steeds of the fleet son of Aeacus comeinto battle with weak hands to drive them. I am sure, if you thinkwell, that we might take them; they will not dare face us if we bothattack them.""

ííííThe valiant son of Anchises was of the same mind, and the pairwent right on, with their shoulders covered under shields of tough dryox-hide, overlaid with much bronze. Chromius and Aretus went also withthem, and their hearts beat high with hope that they might kill themen and capture the horses- fools that they were, for they were not toreturn scatheless from their meeting with Automedon, who prayed tofather Jove and was forthwith filled with courage and strengthabounding. He turned to his trusty comrade Alcimedon and said,""Alcimedon, keep your horses so close up that I may feel theirbreath upon my back; I doubt that we shall not stay Hector son ofPriam till he has killed us and mounted behind the horses; he willthen either spread panic among the ranks of the Achaeans, or himselfbe killed among the foremost.""

ííííOn this he cried out to the two Ajaxes and Menelaus, ""Ajaxescaptains of the Argives, and Menelaus, give the dead body over to themthat are best able to defend it, and come to the rescue of usliving; for Hector and Aeneas who are the two best men among theTrojans, are pressing us hard in the full tide of war. Neverthelessthe issue lies on the lap of heaven, I will therefore hurl my spearand leave the rest to Jove.""

ííííHe poised and hurled as he spoke, whereon the spear struck the roundshield of Aretus, and went right through it for the shield stayed itnot, so that it was driven through his belt into the lower part of hisbelly. As when some sturdy youth, axe in hand, deals his blow behindthe horns of an ox and severs the tendons at the back of its neck sothat it springs forward and then drops, even so did Aretus give onebound and then fall on his back the spear quivering in his body tillit made an end of him. Hector then aimed a spear at Automedon but hesaw it coming and stooped forward to avoid it, so that it flew pasthim and the point stuck in the ground, while the butt-end went onquivering till Mars robbed it of its force. They would then havefought hand to hand with swords had not the two Ajaxes forced theirway through the crowd when they heard their comrade calling, andparted them for all their fury- for Hector, Aeneas, and Chromiuswere afraid and drew back, leaving Aretus to lie there struck to theheart. Automedon, peer of fleet Mars, then stripped him of hisarmour and vaunted over him saying, ""I have done little to assuagemy sorrow for the son of Menoetius, for the man I have killed is notso good as he was.""

ííííAs he spoke he took the blood-stained spoils and laid them uponhis chariot; then he mounted the car with his hands and feet allsteeped in gore as a lion that has been gorging upon a bull.

ííííAnd now the fierce groanful fight again raged about Patroclus, forMinerva came down from heaven and roused its fury by the command offar-seeing Jove, who had changed his mind and sent her to encouragethe Danaans. As when Jove bends his bright bow in heaven in token tomankind either of war or of the chill storms that stay men fromtheir labour and plague the flocks- even so, wrapped in such radiantraiment, did Minerva go in among the host and speak man by man toeach. First she took the form and voice of Phoenix and spoke toMenelaus son of Atreus, who was standing near her. ""Menelaus,"" saidshe, ""it will be shame and dishonour to you, if dogs tear the noblecomrade of Achilles under the walls of Troy. Therefore be staunch, andurge your men to be so also.""

ííííMenelaus answered, ""Phoenix, my good old friend, may Minervavouchsafe me strength and keep the darts from off me, for so shall Istand by Patroclus and defend him; his death has gone to my heart, butHector is as a raging fire and deals his blows without ceasing, forJove is now granting him a time of triumph.""

ííííMinerva was pleased at his having named herself before any of theother gods. Therefore she put strength into his knees and shoulders,and made him as bold as a fly, which, though driven off will yetcome again and bite if it can, so dearly does it love man's blood-even so bold as this did she make him as he stood over Patroclus andthrew his spear. Now there was among the Trojans a man named Podes,son of Eetion, who was both rich and valiant. Hector held him in thehighest honour for he was his comrade and boon companion; the spear ofMenelaus struck this man in the girdle just as he had turned inflight, and went right through him. Whereon he fell heavily forward,and Menelaus son of Atreus drew off his body from the Trojans into theranks of his own people.

ííííApollo then went up to Hector and spurred him on to fight, in thelikeness of Phaenops son of Asius who lived in Abydos and was the mostfavoured of all Hector's guests. In his likeness Apollo said, ""Hector,who of the Achaeans will fear you henceforward now that you havequailed before Menelaus who has ever been rated poorly as a soldier?Yet he has now got a corpse away from the Trojans single-handed, andhas slain your own true comrade, a man brave among the foremost, Podesson of Eetion.

ííííA dark cloud of grief fell upon Hector as he heard, and he madehis way to the front clad in full armour. Thereon the son of Saturnseized his bright tasselled aegis, and veiled Ida in cloud: he sentforth his lightnings and his thunders, and as he shook his aegis hegave victory to the Trojans and routed the Achaeans.

ííííThe panic was begun by Peneleos the Boeotian, for while keepinghis face turned ever towards the foe he had been hit with a spear onthe upper part of the shoulder; a spear thrown by Polydamas had grazedthe top of the bone, for Polydamas had come up to him and struck himfrom close at hand. Then Hector in close combat struck Leitus son ofnoble Alectryon in the hand by the wrist, and disabled him fromfighting further. He looked about him in dismay, knowing that neveragain should he wield spear in battle with the Trojans. While Hectorwas in pursuit of Leitus, Idomeneus struck him on the breastplate overhis chest near the nipple; but the spear broke in the shaft, and theTrojans cheered aloud. Hector then aimed at Idomeneus son of Deucalionas he was standing on his chariot, and very narrowly missed him, butthe spear hit Coiranus, a follower and charioteer of Meriones whohad come with him from Lyctus. Idomeneus had left the ships on footand would have afforded a great triumph to the Trojans if Coiranus hadnot driven quickly up to him, he therefore brought life and rescueto Idomeneus, but himself fell by the hand of murderous Hector. ForHector hit him on the jaw under the ear; the end of the spear droveout his teeth and cut his tongue in two pieces, so that he fell fromhis chariot and let the reins fall to the ground. Meriones gatheredthem up from the ground and took them into his own hands, then he saidto Idomeneus, ""Lay on, till you get back to the ships, for you mustsee that the day is no longer ours.""

ííííOn this Idomeneus lashed the horses to the ships, for fear had takenhold upon him.

ííííAjax and Menelaus noted how Jove had turned the scale in favour ofthe Trojans, and Ajax was first to speak. ""Alas,"" said he, ""even afool may see that father Jove is helping the Trojans. All theirweapons strike home; no matter whether it be a brave man or a cowardthat hurls them, Jove speeds all alike, whereas ours fall each oneof them without effect. What, then, will be best both as regardsrescuing the body, and our return to the joy of our friends who willbe grieving as they look hitherwards; for they will make sure thatnothing can now check the terrible hands of Hector, and that he willfling himself upon our ships. I wish that some one would go and tellthe son of Peleus at once, for I do not think he can have yet heardthe sad news that the dearest of his friends has fallen. But I can seenot a man among the Achaeans to send, for they and their chariotsare alike hidden in darkness. O father Jove, lift this cloud from overthe sons of the Achaeans; make heaven serene, and let us see; if youwill that we perish, let us fall at any rate by daylight.""

ííííFather Jove heard him and had compassion upon his tears. Forthwithhe chased away the cloud of darkness, so that the sun shone out andall the fighting was revealed. Ajax then said to Menelaus, ""Look,Menelaus, and if Antilochus son of Nestor be still living, send him atonce to tell Achilles that by far the dearest to him of all hiscomrades has fallen.""

ííííMenelaus heeded his words and went his way as a lion from astockyard- the lion is tired of attacking the men and hounds, who keepwatch the whole night through and will not let him feast on the fat oftheir herd. In his lust of meat he makes straight at them but in vain,for darts from strong hands assail him, and burning brands which daunthim for all his hunger, so in the morning he slinks sulkily away- evenso did Menelaus sorely against his will leave Patroclus, in great fearlest the Achaeans should be driven back in rout and let him fallinto the hands of the foe. He charged Meriones and the two Ajaxesstraitly saying, ""Ajaxes and Meriones, leaders of the Argives, nowindeed remember how good Patroclus was; he was ever courteous whilealive, bear it in mind now that he is dead.""

ííííWith this Menelaus left them, looking round him as keenly as aneagle, whose sight they say is keener than that of any other bird-however high he may be in the heavens, not a hare that runs can escapehim by crouching under bush or thicket, for he will swoop down upon itand make an end of it- even so, O Menelaus, did your keen eyes rangeround the mighty host of your followers to see if you could find theson of Nestor still alive. Presently Menelaus saw him on the extremeleft of the battle cheering on his men and exhorting them to fightboldly. Menelaus went up to him and said, ""Antilochus, come here andlisten to sad news, which I would indeed were untrue. You must seewith your own eyes that heaven is heaping calamity upon the Danaans,and giving victory to the Trojans. Patroclus has fallen, who was thebravest of the Achaeans, and sorely will the Danaans miss him. Runinstantly to the ships and tell Achilles, that he may come to rescuethe body and bear it to the ships. As for the armour, Hector alreadyhas it.""

ííííAntilochus was struck with horror. For a long time he wasspeechless; his eyes filled with tears and he could find no utterance,but he did as Menelaus had said, and set off running as soon as he hadgiven his armour to a comrade, Laodocus, who was wheeling his horsesround, close beside him.

ííííThus, then, did he run weeping from the field, to carry the bad newsto Achilles son of Peleus. Nor were you, O Menelaus, minded to succourhis harassed comrades, when Antilochus had left the Pylians- andgreatly did they miss him- but he sent them noble Thrasymedes, andhimself went back to Patroclus. He came running up to the two Ajaxesand said, ""I have sent Antilochus to the ships to tell Achilles, butrage against Hector as he may, he cannot come, for he cannot fightwithout armour. What then will be our best plan both as regardsrescuing the dead, and our own escape from death amid the battle-criesof the Trojans?""

ííííAjax answered, ""Menelaus, you have said well: do you, then, andMeriones stoop down, raise the body, and bear it out of the fray,while we two behind you keep off Hector and the Trojans, one inheart as in name, and long used to fighting side by side with oneanother.""

ííííOn this Menelaus and Meriones took the dead man in their arms andlifted him high aloft with a great effort. The Trojan host raised ahue and cry behind them when they saw the Achaeans bearing the bodyaway, and flew after them like hounds attacking a wounded boar atthe loo of a band of young huntsmen. For a while the hounds fly at himas though they would tear him in pieces, but now and again he turns onthem in a fury, scaring and scattering them in all directions- even sodid the Trojans for a while charge in a body, striking with swordand with spears pointed ai both the ends, but when the two Ajaxesfaced them and stood at bay, they would turn pale and no man daredpress on to fight further about the dead.

ííííIn this wise did the two heroes strain every nerve to bear thebody to the ships out of the fight. The battle raged round them likefierce flames that when once kindled spread like wildfire over a city,and the houses fall in the glare of its burning- even such was theroar and tramp of men and horses that pursued them as they borePatroclus from the field. Or as mules that put forth all theirstrength to draw some beam or great piece of ship's timber down arough mountain-track, and they pant and sweat as they, go even sodid Menelaus and pant and sweat as they bore the body of Patroclus.Behind them the two Ajaxes held stoutly out. As some woodedmountain-spur that stretches across a plain will turn water andcheck the flow even of a great river, nor is there any stream strongenough to break through it- even so did the two Ajaxes face theTrojans and stern the tide of their fighting though they keptpouring on towards them and foremost among them all was Aeneas sonof Anchises with valiant Hector. As a flock of daws or starlingsfall to screaming and chattering when they see a falcon, foe to i'llsmall birds, come soaring near them, even so did the Achaean youthraise a babel of cries as they fled before Aeneas and Hector,unmindful of their former prowess. In the rout of the Danaans muchgoodly armour fell round about the trench, and of fighting there wasno end.

ííííBOOK XVIII

ííííTHUS then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. Meanwhile thefleet runner Antilochus, who had been sent as messenger, reachedAchilles, and found him sitting by his tall ships and boding thatwhich was indeed too surely true. ""Alas,"" said he to himself in theheaviness of his heart, ""why are the Achaeans again scouring the plainand flocking towards the ships? Heaven grant the gods be not nowbringing that sorrow upon me of which my mother Thetis spoke, sayingthat while I was yet alive the bravest of the Myrmidons should fallbefore the Trojans, and see the light of the sun no longer. I fear thebrave son of Menoetius has fallen through his own daring and yet Ibade him return to the ships as soon as he had driven back thosethat were bringing fire against them, and not join battle withHector.""

ííííAs he was thus pondering, the son of Nestor came up to him andtold his sad tale, weeping bitterly the while. ""Alas,"" he cried,""son of noble Peleus, I bring you bad tidings, would indeed thatthey were untrue. Patroclus has fallen, and a fight is raging abouthis naked body- for Hector holds his armour.""

ííííA dark cloud of grief fell upon Achilles as he listened. He filledboth hands with dust from off the ground, and poured it over his head,disfiguring his comely face, and letting the refuse settle over hisshirt so fair and new. He flung himself down all huge and hugely atfull length, and tore his hair with his hands. The bondswomen whomAchilles and Patroclus had taken captive screamed aloud for grief,beating their breasts, and with their limbs failing them for sorrow.Antilochus bent over him the while, weeping and holding both his handsas he lay groaning for he feared that he might plunge a knife into hisown throat. Then Achilles gave a loud cry and his mother heard himas she was sitting in the depths of the sea by the old man her father,whereon she screamed, and all the goddesses daughters of Nereus thatdwelt at the bottom of the sea, came gathering round her. There wereGlauce, Thalia and Cymodoce, Nesaia, Speo, thoe and dark-eyed Halie,Cymothoe, Actaea and Limnorea, Melite, Iaera, Amphithoe and Agave,Doto and Proto, Pherusa and Dynamene, Dexamene, Amphinome andCallianeira, Doris, Panope, and the famous sea-nymph Galatea,Nemertes, Apseudes and Callianassa. There were also Clymene, Ianeiraand Ianassa, Maera, Oreithuia and Amatheia of the lovely locks, withother Nereids who dwell in the depths of the sea. The crystal cave wasfilled with their multitude and they all beat their breasts whileThetis led them in their lament.

íííí""Listen,"" she cried, ""sisters, daughters of Nereus, that you mayhear the burden of my sorrows. Alas, woe is me, woe in that I haveborne the most glorious of offspring. I bore him fair and strong, heroamong heroes, and he shot up as a sapling; I tended him as a plantin a goodly garden, and sent him with his ships to Ilius to fightthe Trojans, but never shall I welcome him back to the house ofPeleus. So long as he lives to look upon the light of the sun he is inheaviness, and though I go to him I cannot help him. Nevertheless Iwill go, that I may see my dear son and learn what sorrow has befallenhim though he is still holding aloof from battle.""

ííííShe left the cave as she spoke, while the others followed weepingafter, and the waves opened a path before them. When they reachedthe rich plain of Troy, they came up out of the sea in a long lineon to the sands, at the place where the ships of the Myrmidons weredrawn up in close order round the tents of Achilles. His mother wentup to him as he lay groaning; she laid her hand upon his head andspoke piteously, saying, ""My son, why are you thus weeping? Whatsorrow has now befallen you? Tell me; hide it not from me. Surely Jovehas granted you the prayer you made him, when you lifted up your handsand besought him that the Achaeans might all of them be pent up attheir ships, and rue it bitterly in that you were no longer withthem.""

ííííAchilles groaned and answered, ""Mother, Olympian Jove has indeedvouchsafed me the fulfilment of my prayer, but what boots it to me,seeing that my dear comrade Patroclus has fallen- he whom I valuedmore than all others, and loved as dearly as my own life? I havelost him; aye, and Hector when he had killed him stripped the wondrousarmour, so glorious to behold, which the gods gave to Peleus when theylaid you in the couch of a mortal man. Would that you were stilldwelling among the immortal sea-nymphs, and that Peleus had taken tohimself some mortal bride. For now you shall have grief infinite byreason of the death of that son whom you can never welcome home-nay, I will not live nor go about among mankind unless Hector fallby my spear, and thus pay me for having slain Patroclus son ofMenoetius.""

ííííThetis wept and answered, ""Then, my son, is your end near at hand-for your own death awaits you full soon after that of Hector.""

ííííThen said Achilles in his great grief, ""I would die here and now, inthat I could not save my comrade. He has fallen far from home, andin his hour of need my hand was not there to help him. What is therefor me? Return to my own land I shall not, and I have brought nosaving neither to Patroclus nor to my other comrades of whom so manyhave been slain by mighty Hector; I stay here by my ships a bootlessburden upon the earth, I, who in fight have no peer among theAchaeans, though in council there are better than I. Therefore, perishstrife both from among gods and men, and anger, wherein even arighteous man will harden his heart- which rises up in the soul of aman like smoke, and the taste thereof is sweeter than drops ofhoney. Even so has Agamemnon angered me. And yet- so be it, for itis over; I will force my soul into subjection as I needs must; Iwill go; I will pursue Hector who has slain him whom I loved sodearly, and will then abide my doom when it may please Jove and theother gods to send it. Even Hercules, the best beloved of Jove- evenhe could not escape the hand of death, but fate and Juno's fierceanger laid him low, as I too shall lie when I am dead if a like doomawaits me. Till then I will win fame, and will bid Trojan andDardanian women wring tears from their tender cheeks with both theirhands in the grievousness of their great sorrow; thus shall theyknow that he who has held aloof so long will hold aloof no longer.Hold me not back, therefore, in the love you bear me, for you shallnot move me.""

ííííThen silver-footed Thetis answered, ""My son, what you have said istrue. It is well to save your comrades from destruction, but yourarmour is in the hands of the Trojans; Hector bears it in triumph uponhis own shoulders. Full well I know that his vaunt shall not belasting, for his end is close at hand; go not, however, into the pressof battle till you see me return hither; to-morrow at break of day Ishall be here, and will bring you goodly armour from King Vulcan.""

ííííOn this she left her brave son, and as she turned away she said tothe sea-nymphs her sisters, ""Dive into the bosom of the sea and goto the house of the old sea-god my father. Tell him everything; as forme, I will go to the cunning workman Vulcan on high Olympus, and askhim to provide my son with a suit of splendid armour.""

ííííWhen she had so said, they dived forthwith beneath the waves,while silver-footed Thetis went her way that she might bring thearmour for her son.

ííííThus, then, did her feet bear the goddess to Olympus, andmeanwhile the Achaeans were flying with loud cries before murderousHector till they reached the ships and the Hellespont, and theycould not draw the body of Mars's servant Patroclus out of reach ofthe weapons that were showered upon him, for Hector son of Priamwith his host and horsemen had again caught up to him like the flameof a fiery furnace; thrice did brave Hector seize him by the feet,striving with might and main to draw him away and calling loudly onthe Trojans, and thrice did the two Ajaxes, clothed in valour aswith a garment, beat him from off the body; but all undaunted he wouldnow charge into the thick of the fight, and now again he would standstill and cry aloud, but he would give no ground. As uplandshepherds that cannot chase some famished lion from a carcase, even socould not the two Ajaxes scare Hector son of Priam from the body ofPatroclus.

ííííAnd now he would even have dragged it off and have wonimperishable glory, had not Iris fleet as the wind, winged her wayas messenger from Olympus to the son of Peleus and bidden him arm. Shecame secretly without the knowledge of Jove and of the other gods, forJuno sent her, and when she had got close to him she said, ""Up, son ofPeleus, mightiest of all mankind; rescue Patroclus about whom thisfearful fight is now raging by the ships. Men are killing one another,the Danaans in defence of the dead body, while the Trojans aretrying to hale it away, and take it to wind Ilius: Hector is themost furious of them all; he is for cutting the head from the body andfixing it on the stakes of the wall. Up, then, and bide here nolonger; shrink from the thought that Patroclus may become meat for thedogs of Troy. Shame on you, should his body suffer any kind ofoutrage.""

ííííAnd Achilles said, ""Iris, which of the gods was it that sent youto me?""

ííííIris answered, ""It was Juno the royal spouse of Jove, but the son ofSaturn does not know of my coming, nor yet does any other of theimmortals who dwell on the snowy summits of Olympus.""

ííííThen fleet Achilles answered her saying, ""How can I go up into thebattle? They have my armour. My mother forbade me to arm till I shouldsee her come, for she promised to bring me goodly armour fromVulcan; I know no man whose arms I can put on, save only the shield ofAjax son of Telamon, and he surely must be fighting in the frontrank and wielding his spear about the body of dead Patroclus.""

ííííIris said, 'We know that your armour has been taken, but go as youare; go to the deep trench and show yourelf before the Trojans, thatthey may fear you and cease fighting. Thus will the fainting sons ofthe Achaeans gain some brief breathing-time, which in battle mayhardly be.""

ííííIris left him when she had so spoken. But Achilles dear to Jovearose, and Minerva flung her tasselled aegis round his strongshoulders; she crowned his head with a halo of golden cloud from whichshe kindled a glow of gleaming fire. As the smoke that goes up intoheaven from some city that is being beleaguered on an island far outat sea- all day long do men sally from the city and fight theirhardest, and at the going down of the sun the line of beacon-firesblazes forth, flaring high for those that dwell near them to behold,if so be that they may come with their ships and succour them- even sodid the light flare from the head of Achilles, as he stood by thetrench, going beyond the wall- but he aid not join the Achaeans for heheeded the charge which his mother laid upon him.

ííííThere did he stand and shout aloud. Minerva also raised her voicefrom afar, and spread terror unspeakable among the Trojans. Ringing asthe note of a trumpet that sounds alarm then the foe is at the gatesof a city, even so brazen was the voice of the son of Aeacus, and whenthe Trojans heard its clarion tones they were dismayed; the horsesturned back with their chariots for they boded mischief, and theirdrivers were awe-struck by the steady flame which the grey-eyedgoddess had kindled above the head of the great son of Peleus.

ííííThrice did Achilles raise his loud cry as he stood by the trench,and thrice were the Trojans and their brave allies thrown intoconfusion; whereon twelve of their noblest champions fell beneaththe wheels of their chariots and perished by their own spears. TheAchaeans to their great joy then drew Patroclus out of reach of theweapons, and laid him on a litter: his comrades stood mourning roundhim, and among them fleet Achilles who wept bitterly as he saw histrue comrade lying dead upon his bier. He had sent him out with horsesand chariots into battle, but his return he was not to welcome.

ííííThen Juno sent the busy sun, loth though he was, into the watersof Oceanus; so he set, and the Achaeans had rest from the tug andturmoil of war.

ííííNow the Trojans when they had come out of the fight, unyoked theirhorses and gathered in assembly before preparing their supper. Theykept their feet, nor would any dare to sit down, for fear had fallenupon them all because Achilles had shown himself after having heldaloof so long from battle. Polydamas son of Panthous was first tospeak, a man of judgement, who alone among them could look both beforeand after. He was comrade to Hector, and they had been born upon thesame night; with all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressedthem thus:-

íííí""Look to it well, my friends; I would urge you to go back now toyour city and not wait here by the ships till morning, for we arefar from our walls. So long as this man was at enmity with Agamemnonthe Achaeans were easier to deal with, and I would have gladlycamped by the ships in the hope of taking them; but now I go ingreat fear of the fleet son of Peleus; he is so daring that he willnever bide here on the plain whereon the Trojans and Achaeans fightwith equal valour, but he will try to storm our city and carry off ourwomen. Do then as I say, and let us retreat. For this is what willhappen. The darkness of night will for a time stay the son ofPeleus, but if he find us here in the morning when he sallies forth infull armour, we shall have knowledge of him in good earnest. Gladindeed will he be who can escape and get back to Ilius, and many aTrojan will become meat for dogs and vultures may I never live to hearit. If we do as I say, little though we may like it, we shall havestrength in counsel during the night, and the great gates with thedoors that close them will protect the city. At dawn we can arm andtake our stand on the walls; he will then rue it if he sallies fromthe ships to fight us. He will go back when he has given his horsestheir fill of being driven all whithers under our walls, and will bein no mind to try and force his way into the city. Neither will heever sack it, dogs shall devour him ere he do so.""

ííííHector looked fiercely at him and answered, ""Polydamas, your wordsare not to my liking in that you bid us go back and be pent within thecity. Have you not had enough of being cooped up behind walls? Inthe old-days the city of Priam was famous the whole world over for itswealth of gold and bronze, but our treasures are wasted out of ourhouses, and much goods have been sold away to Phrygia and fair Meonia,for the hand of Jove has been laid heavily upon us. Now, therefore,that the son of scheming Saturn has vouchsafed me to win glory hereand to hem the Achaeans in at their ships, prate no more in thisfool's wise among the people. You will have no man with you; itshall not be; do all of you as I now say;- take your suppers in yourcompanies throughout the host, and keep your watches and be wakefulevery man of you. If any Trojan is uneasy about his possessions, lethim gather them and give them out among the people. Better letthese, rather than the Achaeans, have them. At daybreak we will armand fight about the ships; granted that Achilles has again comeforward to defend them, let it be as he will, but it shall go hardwith him. I shall not shun him, but will fight him, to fall orconquer. The god of war deals out like measure to all, and theslayer may yet be slain.""

ííííThus spoke Hector; and the Trojans, fools that they were, shouted inapplause, for Pallas Minerva had robbed them of their understanding.They gave ear to Hector with his evil counsel, but the wise words ofPolydamas no man would heed. They took their supper throughout thehost, and meanwhile through the whole night the Achaeans mournedPatroclus, and the son of Peleus led them in their lament. He laid hismurderous hands upon the breast of his comrade, groaning again andagain as a bearded lion when a man who was chasing deer has robbed himof his young in some dense forest; when the lion comes back he isfurious, and searches dingle and dell to track the hunter if he canfind him, for he is mad with rage- even so with many a sigh didAchilles speak among the Myrmidons saying, ""Alas! vain were thewords with which I cheered the hero Menoetius in his own house; I saidthat I would bring his brave son back again to Opoeis after he hadsacked Ilius and taken his share of the spoils- but Jove does not giveall men their heart's desire. The same soil shall be reddened hereat Troy by the blood of us both, for I too shall never be welcomedhome by the old knight Peleus, nor by my mother Thetis, but even inthis place shall the earth cover me. Nevertheless, O Patroclus, nowthat I am left behind you, I will not bury you, till I have broughthither the head and armour of mighty Hector who has slain you.Twelve noble sons of Trojans will I behead before your bier toavenge you; till I have done so you shall lie as you are by the ships,and fair women of Troy and Dardanus, whom we have taken with spear andstrength of arm when we sacked men's goodly cities, shall weep overyou both night and day.""

ííííThen Achilles told his men to set a large tripod upon the firethat they might wash the clotted gore from off Patroclus. Thereon theyset a tripod full of bath water on to a clear fire: they threwsticks on to it to make it blaze, and the water became hot as theflame played about the belly of the tripod. When the water in thecauldron was boiling they washed the body, anointed it with oil, andclosed its wounds with ointment that had been kept nine years. Thenthey laid it on a bier and covered it with a linen cloth from headto foot, and over this they laid a fair white robe. Thus all nightlong did the Myrmidons gather round Achilles to mourn Patroclus.

ííííThen Jove said to Juno his sister-wife, ""So, Queen Juno, you havegained your end, and have roused fleet Achilles. One would thinkthat the Achaeans were of your own flesh and blood.""

ííííAnd Juno answered, ""Dread son of Saturn, why should you say thisthing? May not a man though he be only mortal and knows less than wedo, do what he can for another person? And shall not I- foremost ofall goddesses both by descent and as wife to you who reign inheaven- devise evil for the Trojans if I am angry with them?""

ííííThus did they converse. Meanwhile Thetis came to the house ofVulcan, imperishable, star-bespangled, fairest of the abodes inheaven, a house of bronze wrought by the lame god's own hands. Shefound him busy with his bellows, sweating and hard at work, for he wasmaking twenty tripods that were to stand by the wall of his house, andhe set wheels of gold under them all that they might go of their ownselves to the assemblies of the gods, and come back again- marvelsindeed to see. They were finished all but the ears of cunningworkmanship which yet remained to be fixed to them: these he was nowfixing, and he was hammering at the rivets. While he was thus atwork silver-footed Thetis came to the house. Charis, of gracefulhead-dress, wife to the far-famed lame god, came towards her as soonas she saw her, and took her hand in her own, saying, ""Why have youcome to our house, Thetis, honoured and ever welcome- for you do notvisit us often? Come inside and let me set refreshment before you.""

ííííThe goddess led the way as she spoke, and bade Thetis sit on arichly decorated seat inlaid with silver; there was a footstool alsounder her feet. Then she called Vulcan and said, ""Vulcan, come here,Thetis wants you""; and the far-famed lame god answered, ""Then it isindeed an august and honoured goddess who has come here; she it wasthat took care of me when I was suffering from the heavy fall whichI had through my cruel mother's anger- for she would have got rid ofme because I was lame. It would have gone hardly with me had notEurynome, daughter of the ever-encircling waters of Oceanus, andThetis, taken me to their bosom. Nine years did I stay with them,and many beautiful works in bronze, brooches, spiral armlets, cups,and chains, did I make for them in their cave, with the roaring watersof Oceanus foaming as they rushed ever past it; and no one knew,neither of gods nor men, save only Thetis and Eurynome who took careof me. If, then, Thetis has come to my house I must make her duerequital for having saved me; entertain her, therefore, with allhospitality, while I put by my bellows and all my tools.""

ííííOn this the mighty monster hobbled off from his anvil, his thin legsplying lustily under him. He set the bellows away from the fire, andgathered his tools into a silver chest. Then he took a sponge andwashed his face and hands, his shaggy chest and brawny neck; he donnedhis shirt, grasped his strong staff, and limped towards the door.There were golden handmaids also who worked for him, and were likereal young women, with sense and reason, voice also and strength,and all the learning of the immortals; these busied themselves asthe king bade them, while he drew near to Thetis, seated her upon agoodly seat, and took her hand in his own, saying, ""Why have youcome to our house, Thetis honoured and ever welcome- for you do notvisit us often? Say what you want, and I will do it for you at once ifI can, and if it can be done at all.""

ííííThetis wept and answered, ""Vulcan, is there another goddess inOlympus whom the son of Saturn has been pleased to try with so muchaffliction as he has me? Me alone of the marine goddesses did hemake subject to a mortal husband, Peleus son of Aeacus, and sorelyagainst my will did I submit to the embraces of one who was butmortal, and who now stays at home worn out with age. Neither is thisall. Heaven vouchsafed me a son, hero among heroes, and he shot upas a sapling. I tended him as a plant in a goodly garden and senthim with his ships to Ilius to fight the Trojans, but never shall Iwelcome him back to the house of Peleus. So long as he lives to lookupon the light of the sun, he is in heaviness, and though I go tohim I cannot help him; King Agamemnon has made him give up themaiden whom the sons of the Achaeans had awarded him, and he wasteswith sorrow for her sake. Then the Trojans hemmed the Achaeans in attheir ships' sterns and would not let them come forth; the elders,therefore, of the Argives besought Achilles and offered him greattreasure, whereon he refused to bring deliverance to them himself, butput his own armour on Patroclus and sent him into the fight withmuch people after him. All day long they fought by the Scaean gatesand would have taken the city there and then, had not Apollovouchsafed glory to Hector and slain the valiant son of Menoetiusafter he had done the Trojans much evil. Therefore I am suppliant atyour knees if haply you may be pleased to provide my son, whose end isnear at hand, with helmet and shield, with goodly greaves fittedwith ancle-clasps, and with a breastplate, for he lost his own whenhis true comrade fell at the hands of the Trojans, and he now liesstretched on earth in the bitterness of his soul.""

ííííAnd Vulcan answered, ""Take heart, and be no more disquieted aboutthis matter; would that I could hide him from death's sight when hishour is come, so surely as I can find him armour that shall amazethe eyes of all who behold it.""

ííííWhen he had so said he left her and went to his bellows, turningthem towards the fire and bidding them do their office. Twenty bellowsblew upon the melting-pots, and they blew blasts of every kind, somefierce to help him when he had need of them, and others less strong asVulcan willed it in the course of his work. He threw tough copper intothe fire, and tin, with silver and gold; he set his great anvil on itsblock, and with one hand grasped his mighty hammer while he took thetongs in the other.

ííííFirst he shaped the shield so great and strong, adorning it all overand binding it round with a gleaming circuit in three layers; andthe baldric was made of silver. He made the shield in fivethicknesses, and with many a wonder did his cunning hand enrich it.

ííííHe wrought the earth, the heavens, and the sea; the moon also at herfull and the untiring sun, with all the signs that glorify the face ofheaven- the Pleiads, the Hyads, huge Orion, and the Bear, which menalso call the Wain and which turns round ever in one place, facing.Orion, and alone never dips into the stream of Oceanus.

ííííHe wrought also two cities, fair to see and busy with the hum ofmen. In the one were weddings and wedding-feasts, and they weregoing about the city with brides whom they were escorting bytorchlight from their chambers. Loud rose the cry of Hymen, and theyouths danced to the music of flute and lyre, while the women stoodeach at her house door to see them.

ííííMeanwhile the people were gathered in assembly, for there was aquarrel, and two men were wrangling about the blood-money for a manwho had been killed, the one saying before the people that he had paiddamages in full, and the other that he had not been paid. Each wastrying to make his own case good, and the people took sides, eachman backing the side that he had taken; but the heralds kept themback, and the elders sate on their seats of stone in a solemncircle, holding the staves which the heralds had put into their hands.Then they rose and each in his turn gave judgement, and there were twotalents laid down, to be given to him whose judgement should be deemedthe fairest.

ííííAbout the other city there lay encamped two hosts in gleamingarmour, and they were divided whether to sack it, or to spare it andaccept the half of what it contained. But the men of the city wouldnot yet consent, and armed themselves for a surprise; their wivesand little children kept guard upon the walls, and with them werethe men who were past fighting through age; but the others salliedforth with Mars and Pallas Minerva at their head- both of them wroughtin gold and clad in golden raiment, great and fair with their armouras befitting gods, while they that followed were smaller. When theyreached the place where they would lay their ambush, it was on ariverbed to which live stock of all kinds would come from far and nearto water; here, then, they lay concealed, clad in full armour. Someway off them there were two scouts who were on the look-out for thecoming of sheep or cattle, which presently came, followed by twoshepherds who were playing on their pipes, and had not so much as athought of danger. When those who were in ambush saw this, they cutoff the flocks and herds and killed the shepherds. Meanwhile thebesiegers, when they heard much noise among the cattle as they satin council, sprang to their horses, and made with all speed towardsthem; when they reached them they set battle in array by the banksof the river, and the hosts aimed their bronze-shod spears at oneanother. With them were Strife and Riot, and fell Fate who wasdragging three men after her, one with a fresh wound, and the otherunwounded, while the third was dead, and she was dragging him along byhis heel: and her robe was bedrabbled in men's blood. They went in andout with one another and fought as though they were living peoplehaling away one another's dead.

ííííHe wrought also a fair fallow field, large and thrice ploughedalready. Many men were working at the plough within it, turningtheir oxen to and fro, furrow after furrow. Each time that they turnedon reaching the headland a man would come up to them and give them acup of wine, and they would go back to their furrows looking forwardto the time when they should again reach the headland. The part thatthey had ploughed was dark behind them, so that the field, though itwas of gold, still looked as if it were being ploughed- very curiousto behold.

ííííHe wrought also a field of harvest corn, and the reapers werereaping with sharp sickles in their hands. Swathe after swathe fell tothe ground in a straight line behind them, and the binders boundthem in bands of twisted straw. There were three binders, and behindthem there were boys who gathered the cut corn in armfuls and kepton bringing them to be bound: among them all the owner of the landstood by in silence and was glad. The servants were getting a mealready under an oak, for they had sacrificed a great ox, and werebusy cutting him up, while the women were making a porridge of muchwhite barley for the labourers' dinner.

ííííHe wrought also a vineyard, golden and fair to see, and the vineswere loaded with grapes. The bunches overhead were black, but thevines were trained on poles of silver. He ran a ditch of dark metalall round it, and fenced it with a fence of tin; there was only onepath to it, and by this the vintagers went when they would gatherthe vintage. Youths and maidens all blithe and full of glee, carriedthe luscious fruit in plaited baskets; and with them there went aboy who made sweet music with his lyre, and sang the Linus-song withhis clear boyish voice.

ííííHe wrought also a herd of homed cattle. He made the cows of gold andtin, and they lowed as they came full speed out of the yards to go andfeed among the waving reeds that grow by the banks of the river. Alongwith the cattle there went four shepherds, all of them in gold, andtheir nine fleet dogs went with them. Two terrible lions hadfastened on a bellowing bull that was with the foremost cows, andbellow as he might they haled him, while the dogs and men gavechase: the lions tore through the bull's thick hide and were gorgingon his blood and bowels, but the herdsmen were afraid to doanything, and only hounded on their dogs; the dogs dared not fasten onthe lions but stood by barking and keeping out of harm's way.

ííííThe god wrought also a pasture in a fair mountain dell, and largeflock of sheep, with a homestead and huts, and sheltered sheepfolds.

ííííFurthermore he wrought a green, like that which Daedalus once madein Cnossus for lovely Ariadne. Hereon there danced youths andmaidens whom all would woo, with their hands on one another'swrists. The maidens wore robes of light linen, and the youths wellwoven shirts that were slightly oiled. The girls were crowned withgarlands, while the young men had daggers of gold that hung bysilver baldrics; sometimes they would dance deftly in a ring withmerry twinkling feet, as it were a potter sitting at his work andmaking trial of his wheel to see whether it will run, and sometimesthey would go all in line with one another, and much people wasgathered joyously about the green. There was a bard also to sing tothem and play his lyre, while two tumblers went about performing inthe midst of them when the man struck up with his tune.

ííííAll round the outermost rim of the shield he set the mighty streamof the river Oceanus.

ííííThen when he had fashioned the shield so great and strong, he made abreastplate also that shone brighter than fire. He made helmet,close fitting to the brow, and richly worked, with a golden plumeoverhanging it; and he made greaves also of beaten tin.

ííííLastly, when the famed lame god had made all the armour, he tookit and set it before the mother of Achilles; whereon she darted like afalcon from the snowy summits of Olympus and bore away the gleamingarmour from the house of Vulcan.

ííííBOOK XIX

ííííNOW when Dawn in robe of saffron was hasting from the streams ofOceanus, to bring light to mortals and immortals, Thetis reached theships with the armour that the god had given her. She found her sonfallen about the body of Patroclus and weeping bitterly. Many alsoof his followers were weeping round him, but when the goddess cameamong them she clasped his hand in her own, saying, ""My son, grieve aswe may we must let this man lie, for it is by heaven's will that hehas fallen; now, therefore, accept from Vulcan this rich and goodlyarmour, which no man has ever yet borne upon his shoulders.""

ííííAs she spoke she set the armour before Achilles, and it rang outbravely as she did so. The Myrmidons were struck with awe, and nonedared look full at it, for they were afraid; but Achilles was rousedto still greater fury, and his eyes gleamed with a fierce light, forhe was glad when he handled the splendid present which the god hadmade him. Then, as soon as he had satisfied himself with looking atit, he said to his mother, ""Mother, the god has given me armour,meet handiwork for an immortal and such as no living could havefashioned; I will now arm, but I much fear that flies will settle uponthe son of Menoetius and breed worms about his wounds, so that hisbody, now he is dead, will be disfigured and the flesh will rot.""

ííííSilver-footed Thetis answered, ""My son, be not disquieted about thismatter. I will find means to protect him from the swarms of noisomeflies that prey on the bodies of men who have been killed in battle.He may lie for a whole year, and his flesh shall still be as soundas ever, or even sounder. Call, therefore, the Achaean heroes inassembly; unsay your anger against Agamemnon; arm at once, and fightwith might and main.""

ííííAs she spoke she put strength and courage into his heart, and shethen dropped ambrosia and red nectar into the wounds of Patroclus,that his body might suffer no change.

ííííThen Achilles went out upon the seashore, and with a loud cry calledon the Achaean heroes. On this even those who as yet had stayed alwaysat the ships, the pilots and helmsmen, and even the stewards whowere about the ships and served out rations, all came to the placeof assembly because Achilles had shown himself after having held aloofso long from fighting. Two sons of Mars, Ulysses and the son ofTydeus, came limping, for their wounds still pained them; neverthelessthey came, and took their seats in the front row of the assembly. Lastof all came Agamemnon, king of men, he too wounded, for Coon son ofAntenor had struck him with a spear in battle.

ííííWhen the Achaeans were got together Achilles rose and said, ""Sonof Atreus, surely it would have been better alike for both you and me,when we two were in such high anger about Briseis, surely it wouldhave been better, had Diana's arrow slain her at the ships on theday when I took her after having sacked Lyrnessus. For so, many anAchaean the less would have bitten dust before the foe in the daysof my anger. It has been well for Hector and the Trojans, but theAchaeans will long indeed remember our quarrel. Now, however, let itbe, for it is over. If we have been angry, necessity has schooledour anger. I put it from me: I dare not nurse it for ever;therefore, bid the Achaeans arm forthwith that I may go out againstthe Trojans, and learn whether they will be in a mind to sleep bythe ships or no. Glad, I ween, will he be to rest his knees who mayfly my spear when I wield it.""

ííííThus did he speak, and the Achaeans rejoiced in that he had put awayhis anger.

ííííThen Agamemnon spoke, rising in his place, and not going into themiddle of the assembly. ""Danaan heroes,"" said he, ""servants of Mars,it is well to listen when a man stands up to speak, and it is notseemly to interrupt him, or it will go hard even with a practisedspeaker. Who can either hear or speak in an uproar? Even the finest

ííííorator will be disconcerted by it. I will expound to the son ofPeleus, and do you other Achaeans heed me and mark me well. Often havethe Achaeans spoken to me of this matter and upbraided me, but itwas not I that did it: Jove, and Fate, and Erinys that walks indarkness struck me mad when we were assembled on the day that I tookfrom Achilles the meed that had been awarded to him. What could Ido? All things are in the hand of heaven, and Folly, eldest ofJove's daughters, shuts men's eyes to their destruction. She walksdelicately, not on the solid earth, but hovers over the heads of mento make them stumble or to ensnare them.

íííí""Time was when she fooled Jove himself, who they say is greatestwhether of gods or men; for Juno, woman though she was, beguiled himon the day when Alcmena was to bring forth mighty Hercules in the faircity of Thebes. He told it out among the gods saying, 'Hear me allgods and goddesses, that I may speak even as I am minded; this dayshall an Ilithuia, helper of women who are in labour, bring a manchild into the world who shall be lord over all that dwell about himwho are of my blood and lineage.' Then said Juno all crafty and fullof guile, 'You will play false, and will not hold to your word.Swear me, O Olympian, swear me a great oath, that he who shall thisday fall between the feet of a woman, shall be lord over all thatdwell about him who are of your blood and lineage.'

íííí""Thus she spoke, and Jove suspected her not, but swore the greatoath, to his much ruing thereafter. For Juno darted down from the highsummit of Olympus, and went in haste to Achaean Argos where she knewthat the noble wife of Sthenelus son of Perseus then was. She beingwith child and in her seventh month, Juno brought the child to birththough there was a month still wanting, but she stayed the offspringof Alcmena, and kept back the Ilithuiae. Then she went to tell Jovethe son of Saturn, and said, 'Father Jove, lord of the lightning- Ihave a word for your ear. There is a fine child born this day,Eurystheus, son to Sthenelus the son of Perseus; he is of yourlineage; it is well, therefore, that he should reign over theArgives.'

íííí""On this Jove was stung to the very quick, and in his rage he caughtFolly by the hair, and swore a great oath that never should sheagain invade starry heaven and Olympus, for she was the bane of all.Then he whirled her round with a twist of his hand, and flung her downfrom heaven so that she fell on to the fields of mortal men; and hewas ever angry with her when he saw his son groaning under the cruellabours that Eurystheus laid upon him. Even so did I grieve whenmighty Hector was killing the Argives at their ships, and all the timeI kept thinking of Folly who had so baned me. I was blind, and Joverobbed me of my reason; I will now make atonement, and will add muchtreasure by way of amends. Go, therefore, into battle, you and yourpeople with you. I will give you all that Ulysses offered youyesterday in your tents: or if it so please you, wait, though youwould fain fight at once, and my squires shall bring the gifts from myship, that you may see whether what I give you is enough.""

ííííAnd Achilles answered, ""Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, youcan give such gifts as you think proper, or you can withhold them:it is in your own hands. Let us now set battle in array; it is notwell to tarry talking about trifles, for there is a deed which is asyet to do. Achilles shall again be seen fighting among the foremost,and laying low the ranks of the Trojans: bear this in mind each one ofyou when he is fighting.""

ííííThen Ulysses said, ""Achilles, godlike and brave, send not theAchaeans thus against Ilius to fight the Trojans fasting, for thebattle will be no brief one, when it is once begun, and heaven hasfilled both sides with fury; bid them first take food both bread andwine by the ships, for in this there is strength and stay. No mancan do battle the livelong day to the going down of the sun if he iswithout food; however much he may want to fight his strength will failhim before he knows it; hunger and thirst will find him out, and hislimbs will grow weary under him. But a man can fight all day if heis full fed with meat and wine; his heart beats high, and his strengthwill stay till he has routed all his foes; therefore, send thepeople away and bid them prepare their meal; King Agamemnon will bringout the gifts in presence of the assembly, that all may see them andyou may be satisfied. Moreover let him swear an oath before theArgives that he has never gone up into the couch of Briseis, norbeen with her after the manner of men and women; and do you, too, showyourself of a gracious mind; let Agamemnon entertain you in histents with a feast of reconciliation, that so you may have had yourdues in full. As for you, son of Atreus, treat people more righteouslyin future; it is no disgrace even to a king that he should make amendsif he was wrong in the first instance.""

ííííAnd King Agamemnon answered, ""Son of Laertes, your words please mewell, for throughout you have spoken wisely. I will swear as you wouldhave me do; I do so of my own free will, neither shall I take the nameof heaven in vain. Let, then, Achilles wait, though he would fainfight at once, and do you others wait also, till the gifts come frommy tent and we ratify the oath with sacrifice. Thus, then, do I chargeyou: take some noble young Achaeans with you, and bring from mytents the gifts that I promised yesterday to Achilles, and bring thewomen also; furthermore let Talthybius find me a boar from thosethat are with the host, and make it ready for sacrifice to Jove and tothe sun.""

ííííThen said Achilles, ""Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, see tothese matters at some other season, when there is breathing time andwhen I am calmer. Would you have men eat while the bodies of thosewhom Hector son of Priam slew are still lying mangled upon theplain? Let the sons of the Achaeans, say I, fight fasting andwithout food, till we have avenged them; afterwards at the goingdown of the sun let them eat their fill. As for me, Patroclus is lyingdead in my tent, all hacked and hewn, with his feet to the door, andhis comrades are mourning round him. Therefore I can take thought ofnothing save only slaughter and blood and the rattle in the throatof the dying.""

ííííUlysses answered, ""Achilles, son of Peleus, mightiest of all theAchaeans, in battle you are better than I, and that more than alittle, but in counsel I am much before you, for I am older and ofgreater knowledge. Therefore be patient under my words. Fighting isa thing of which men soon surfeit, and when Jove, who is wars steward,weighs the upshot, it may well prove that the straw which oursickles have reaped is far heavier than the grain. It may not bethat the Achaeans should mourn the dead with their bellies; day by daymen fall thick and threefold continually; when should we haverespite from our sorrow? Let us mourn our dead for a day and bury themout of sight and mind, but let those of us who are left eat anddrink that we may arm and fight our foes more fiercely. In that hourlet no man hold back, waiting for a second summons; such summons shallbode ill for him who is found lagging behind at our ships; let usrather sally as one man and loose the fury of war upon the Trojans.""

ííííWhen he had thus spoken he took with him the sons of Nestor, withMeges son of Phyleus, Thoas, Meriones, Lycomedes son of Creontes,and Melanippus, and went to the tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus. Theword was not sooner said than the deed was done: they brought outthe seven tripods which Agamemnon had promised, with the twentymetal cauldrons and the twelve horses; they also brought the womenskilled in useful arts, seven in number, with Briseis, which madeeight. Ulysses weighed out the ten talents of gold and then led the

ííííway back, while the young Achaeans brought the rest of the gifts,and laid them in the middle of the assembly.

ííííAgamemnon then rose, and Talthybius whose voice was like that of agod came to him with the boar. The son of Atreus drew the knifewhich he wore by the scabbard of his mighty sword, and began bycutting off some bristles from the boar, lifting up his hands inprayer as he did so. The other Achaeans sat where they were all silentand orderly to hear the king, and Agamemnon looked into the vault ofheaven and prayed saying, ""I call Jove the first and mightiest ofall gods to witness, I call also Earth and Sun and the Erinyes whodwell below and take vengeance on him who shall swear falsely, thatI have laid no hand upon the girl Briseis, neither to take her to mybed nor otherwise, but that she has remained in my tents inviolate. IfI swear falsely may heaven visit me with all the penalties which itmetes out to those who perjure themselves.""

ííííHe cut the boar's throat as he spoke, whereon Talthybius whirledit round his head, and flung it into the wide sea to feed thefishes. Then Achilles also rose and said to the Argives, ""Father Jove,of a truth you blind men's eyes and bane them. The son of Atreus hadnot else stirred me to so fierce an anger, nor so stubbornly takenBriseis from me against my will. Surely Jove must have counselledthe destruction of many an Argive. Go, now, and take your food that wemay begin fighting.""

ííííOn this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his ownship. The Myrmidons attended to the presents and took them away to theship of Achilles. They placed them in his tents, while thestable-men drove the horses in among the others.

ííííBriseis, fair as Venus, when she saw the mangled body ofPatroclus, flung herself upon it and cried aloud, tearing herbreast, her neck, and her lovely face with both her hands. Beautifulas a goddess she wept and said, ""Patroclus, dearest friend, when Iwent hence I left you living; I return, O prince, to find you dead;thus do fresh sorrows multiply upon me one after the other. I sawhim to whom my father and mother married me, cut down before our city,and my three own dear brothers perished with him on the self-same day;but you, Patroclus, even when Achilles slew my husband and sackedthe city of noble Mynes, told me that I was not to weep, for yousaid you would make Achilles marry me, and take me back with him toPhthia, we should have a wedding feast among the Myrmidons. You werealways kind to me and I shall never cease to grieve for you.""

ííííShe wept as she spoke, and the women joined in her lament-makingas though their tears were for Patroclus, but in truth each wasweeping for her own sorrows. The elders of the Achaeans gathered roundAchilles and prayed him to take food, but he groaned and would notdo so. ""I pray you,"" said he, ""if any comrade will hear me, bid meneither eat nor drink, for I am in great heaviness, and will stayfasting even to the going down of the sun.""

ííííOn this he sent the other princes away, save only the two sons ofAtreus and Ulysses, Nestor, Idomeneus, and the knight Phoenix, whostayed behind and tried to comfort him in the bitterness of hissorrow: but he would not be comforted till he should have flunghimself into the jaws of battle, and he fetched sigh on sigh, thinkingever of Patroclus. Then he said-

íííí""Hapless and dearest comrade, you it was who would get a good dinnerready for me at once and without delay when the Achaeans werehasting to fight the Trojans; now, therefore, though I have meat anddrink in my tents, yet will I fast for sorrow. Grief greater than thisI could not know, not even though I were to hear of the death of myfather, who is now in Phthia weeping for the loss of me his son, whoam here fighting the Trojans in a strange land for the accursed sakeof Helen, nor yet though I should hear that my son is no more- hewho is being brought up in Scyros- if indeed Neoptolemus is stillliving. Till now I made sure that I alone was to fall here at Troyaway from Argos, while you were to return to Phthia, bring back my sonwith you in your own ship, and show him all my property, mybondsmen, and the greatness of my house- for Peleus must surely beeither dead, or what little life remains to him is oppressed alikewith the infirmities of age and ever present fear lest he shouldhear the sad tidings of my death.""

ííííHe wept as he spoke, and the elders sighed in concert as eachthought on what he had left at home behind him. The son of Saturnlooked down with pity upon them, and said presently to Minerva, ""Mychild, you have quite deserted your hero; is he then gone so clean outof your recollection? There he sits by the ships all desolate forthe loss of his dear comrade, and though the others are gone totheir dinner he will neither eat nor drink. Go then and drop nectarand ambrosia into his breast, that he may know no hunger.""

ííííWith these words he urged Minerva, who was already of the same mind.She darted down from heaven into the air like some falcon sailing onhis broad wings and screaming. Meanwhile the Achaeans were armingthroughout the host, and when Minerva had dropped nectar andambrosia into Achilles so that no cruel hunger should cause hislimbs to fail him, she went back to the house of her mighty father.Thick as the chill snow-flakes shed from the hand of Jove and borne onthe keen blasts of the north wind, even so thick did the gleaminghelmets, the bossed shields, the strongly plated breastplates, and theashen spears stream from the ships. The sheen pierced the sky, thewhole land was radiant with their flashing armour, and the sound ofthe tramp of their treading rose from under their feet. In the midstof them all Achilles put on his armour; he gnashed his teeth, his eyesgleamed like fire, for his grief was greater than he could bear. Thus,then, full of fury against the Trojans, did he don the gift of thegod, the armour that Vulcan had made him.

ííííFirst he put on the goodly greaves fitted with ancle-clasps, andnext he did on the breastplate about his chest. He slung thesilver-studded sword of bronze about his shoulders, and then took upthe shield so great and strong that shone afar with a splendour asof the moon. As the light seen by sailors from out at sea, when menhave lit a fire in their homestead high up among the mountains, butthe sailors are carried out to sea by wind and storm far from thehaven where they would be- even so did the gleam of Achilles' wondrousshield strike up into the heavens. He lifted the redoubtable helmet,and set it upon his head, from whence it shone like a star, and thegolden plumes which Vulcan had set thick about the ridge of thehelmet, waved all around it. Then Achilles made trial of himself inhis armour to see whether it fitted him, so that his limbs couldplay freely under it, and it seemed to buoy him up as though it hadbeen wings.

ííííHe also drew his father's spear out of the spear-stand, a spear sogreat and heavy and strong that none of the Achaeans save onlyAchilles had strength to wield it; this was the spear of Pelian ashfrom the topmost ridges of Mt. Pelion, which Chiron had once givento Peleus, fraught with the death of heroes. Automedon and Alcimusbusied themselves with the harnessing of his horses; they made thebands fast about them, and put the bit in their mouths, drawing thereins back towards the chariot. Automedon, whip in hand, sprang upbehind the horses, and after him Achilles mounted in full armour,resplendent as the sun-god Hyperion. Then with a loud voice hechided with his father's horses saying, ""Xanthus and Balius, famedoffspring of Podarge- this time when we have done fighting be sure andbring your driver safely back to the host of the Achaeans, and donot leave him dead on the plain as you did Patroclus.""

ííííThen fleet Xanthus answered under the yoke- for white-armed Juno hadendowed him with human speech- and he bowed his head till his manetouched the ground as it hung down from under the yoke-band. ""DreadAchilles,"" said he, ""we will indeed save you now, but the day ofyour death is near, and the blame will not be ours, for it will beheaven and stern fate that will destroy you. Neither was it throughany sloth or slackness on our part that the Trojans stripped Patroclusof his armour; it was the mighty god whom lovely Leto bore that slewhim as he fought among the foremost, and vouchsafed a triumph toHector. We two can fly as swiftly as Zephyrus who they say is fleetestof all winds; nevertheless it is your doom to fall by the hand of aman and of a god.""

ííííWhen he had thus said the Erinyes stayed his speech, and Achillesanswered him in great sadness, saying, ""Why, O Xanthus, do you thusforetell my death? You need not do so, for I well know that I am tofall here, far from my dear father and mother; none the more, however,shall I stay my hand till I have given the Trojans their fill offighting.""

ííííSo saying, with a loud cry he drove his horses to the front.

ííííBOOK XX

ííííTHUS, then, did the Achaeans arm by their ships round you, O sonof Peleus, who were hungering for battle; while the Trojans overagainst them armed upon the rise of the plain.

ííííMeanwhile Jove from the top of many-delled Olympus, bade Themisgather the gods in council, whereon she went about and called themto the house of Jove. There was not a river absent except Oceanus, nora single one of the nymphs that haunt fair groves, or springs ofrivers and meadows of green grass. When they reached the house ofcloud-compelling Jove, they took their seats in the arcades ofpolished marble which Vulcan with his consummate skill had made forfather Jove.

ííííIn such wise, therefore, did they gather in the house of Jove.Neptune also, lord of the earthquake, obeyed the call of thegoddess, and came up out of the sea to join them. There, sitting inthe midst of them, he asked what Jove's purpose might be. ""Why,""said he, ""wielder of the lightning, have you called the gods incouncil? Are you considering some matter that concerns the Trojans andAchaeans- for the blaze of battle is on the point of being kindledbetween them?""

ííííAnd Jove answered, ""You know my purpose, shaker of earth, andwherefore I have called you hither. I take thought for them even intheir destruction. For my own part I shall stay here seated on Mt.Olympus and look on in peace, but do you others go about among Trojansand Achaeans, and help either side as you may be severally disposed.If Achilles fights the Trojans without hindrance they will make nostand against him; they have ever trembled at the sight of him, andnow that he is roused to such fury about his comrade, he will overridefate itself and storm their city.""

ííííThus spoke Jove and gave the word for war, whereon the gods tooktheir several sides and went into battle. Juno, Pallas Minerva,earth-encircling Neptune, Mercury bringer of good luck and excellentin all cunning- all these joined the host that came from the ships;with them also came Vulcan in all his glory, limping, but yet with histhin legs plying lustily under him. Mars of gleaming helmet joined theTrojans, and with him Apollo of locks unshorn, and the archergoddess Diana, Leto, Xanthus, and laughter-loving Venus.

ííííSo long as the gods held themselves aloof from mortal warriors theAchaeans were triumphant, for Achilles who had long refused to fightwas now with them. There was not a Trojan but his limbs failed him forfear as he beheld the fleet son of Peleus all glorious in hisarmour, and looking like Mars himself. When, however, the Olympianscame to take their part among men, forthwith uprose strong Strife,rouser of hosts, and Minerva raised her loud voice, now standing bythe deep trench that ran outside the wall, and now shouting with allher might upon the shore of the sounding sea. Mars also bellowed outupon the other side, dark as some black thunder-cloud, and called onthe Trojans at the top of his voice, now from the acropolis, and nowspeeding up the side of the river Simois till he came to the hillCallicolone.

ííííThus did the gods spur on both hosts to fight, and rouse fiercecontention also among themselves. The sire of gods and men thunderedfrom heaven above, while from beneath Neptune shook the vast earth,and bade the high hills tremble. The spurs and crests ofmany-fountained Ida quaked, as also the city of the Trojans and theships of the Achaeans. Hades, king of the realms below, was struckwith fear; he sprang panic-stricken from his throne and cried aloud interror lest Neptune, lord of the earthquake, should crack the groundover his head, and lay bare his mouldy mansions to the sight ofmortals and immortals- mansions so ghastly grim that even the godsshudder to think of them. Such was the uproar as the gods cametogether in battle. Apollo with his arrows took his stand to face KingNeptune, while Minerva took hers against the god of war; the

ííííarcher-goddess Diana with her golden arrows, sister of far-dartingApollo, stood to face Juno; Mercury the lusty bringer of good luckfaced Leto, while the mighty eddying river whom men can Scamander, butgods Xanthus, matched himself against Vulcan.

ííííThe gods, then, were thus ranged against one another. But theheart of Achilles was set on meeting Hector son of Priam, for it waswith his blood that he longed above all things else to glut thestubborn lord of battle. Meanwhile Apollo set Aeneas on to attackthe son of Peleus, and put courage into his heart, speaking with thevoice of Lycaon son of Priam. In his likeness therefore, he said toAeneas, ""Aeneas, counsellor of the Trojans, where are now the bravewords with which you vaunted over your wine before the Trojan princes,saying that you would fight Achilles son of Peleus in single combat?""

ííííAnd Aeneas answered, ""Why do you thus bid me fight the proud sonof Peleus, when I am in no mind to do so? Were I to face him now, itwould not be for the first time. His spear has already put me to Rightfrom Ida, when he attacked our cattle and sacked Lyrnessus andPedasus; Jove indeed saved me in that he vouchsafed me strength tofly, else had the fallen by the hands of Achilles and Minerva, whowent before him to protect him and urged him to fall upon theLelegae and Trojans. No man may fight Achilles, for one of the gods isalways with him as his guardian angel, and even were it not so, hisweapon flies ever straight, and fails not to pierce the flesh of himwho is against him; if heaven would let me fight him on even termshe should not soon overcome me, though he boasts that he is made ofbronze.""

ííííThen said King Apollo, son to Jove, ""Nay, hero, pray to theever-living gods, for men say that you were born of Jove's daughterVenus, whereas Achilles is son to a goddess of inferior rank. Venus ischild to Jove, while Thetis is but daughter to the old man of the sea.Bring, therefore, your spear to bear upon him, and let him not scareyou with his taunts and menaces.""

ííííAs he spoke he put courage into the heart of the shepherd of hispeople, and he strode in full armour among the ranks of the foremostfighters. Nor did the son of Anchises escape the notice of white-armedJuno, as he went forth into the throng to meet Achilles. She calledthe gods about her, and said, ""Look to it, you two, Neptune andMinerva, and consider how this shall be; Phoebus Apollo has beensending Aeneas clad in full armour to fight Achilles. Shall we turnhim back at once, or shall one of us stand by Achilles and endow himwith strength so that his heart fail not, and he may learn that thechiefs of the immortals are on his side, while the others who have allalong been defending the Trojans are but vain helpers? Let us all comedown from Olympus and join in the fight, that this day he may takeno hurt at the hands of the Trojans. Hereafter let him suffer whateverfate may have spun out for him when he was begotten and his motherbore him. If Achilles be not thus assured by the voice of a god, hemay come to fear presently when one of us meets him in battle, for thegods are terrible if they are seen face to face.""

ííííNeptune lord of the earthquake answered her saying, ""Juno,restrain your fury; it is not well; I am not in favour of forcingthe other gods to fight us, for the advantage is too greatly on ourown side; let us take our places on some hill out of the beaten track,and let mortals fight it out among themselves. If Mars or PhoebusApollo begin fighting, or keep Achilles in check so that he cannotfight, we too, will at once raise the cry of battle, and in thatcase they will soon leave the field and go back vanquished toOlympus among the other gods.""

ííííWith these words the dark-haired god led the way to the highearth-barrow of Hercules, built round solid masonry, and made by theTrojans and Pallas Minerva for him fly to when the sea-monster waschasing him from the shore on to the plain. Here Neptune and thosethat were with him took their seats, wrapped in a thick cloud ofdarkness; but the other gods seated themselves on the brow ofCallicolone round you, O Phoebus, and Mars the waster of cities.

ííííThus did the gods sit apart and form their plans, but neither sidewas willing to begin battle with the other, and Jove from his seaton high was in command over them all. Meanwhile the whole plain wasalive with men and horses, and blazing with the gleam of armour. Theearth rang again under the tramp of their feet as they rushedtowards each other, and two champions, by far the foremost of themall, met between the hosts to fight- to wit, Aeneas son of Anchises,and noble Achilles.

ííííAeneas was first to stride forward in attack, his doughty helmettossing defiance as he came on. He held his strong shield before hisbreast, and brandished his bronze spear. The son of Peleus from theother side sprang forth to meet him, fike some fierce lion that thewhole country-side has met to hunt and kill- at first he bodes no ill,but when some daring youth has struck him with a spear, he crouchesopenmouthed, his jaws foam, he roars with fury, he lashes his tailfrom side to side about his ribs and loins, and glares as he springsstraight before him, to find out whether he is to slay, or be slainamong the foremost of his foes- even with such fury did Achillesburn to spring upon Aeneas.

ííííWhen they were now close up with one another Achilles was first tospeak. ""Aeneas,"" said he, ""why do you stand thus out before the hostto fight me? Is it that you hope to reign over the Trojans in the seatof Priam? Nay, though you kill me Priam will not hand his kingdom overto you. He is a man of sound judgement, and he has sons of his own. Orhave the Trojans been allotting you a demesne of passing richness,fair with orchard lawns and corn lands, if you should slay me? Thisyou shall hardly do. I have discomfited you once already. Have youforgotten how when you were alone I chased you from your herdshelter-skelter down the slopes of Ida? You did not turn round tolook behind you; you took refuge in Lyrnessus, but I attacked thecity, and with the help of Minerva and father Jove I sacked it andcarried its women into captivity, though Jove and the other godsrescued you. You think they will protect you now, but they will not doso; therefore I say go back into the host, and do not face me, oryou will rue it. Even a fool may be wise after the event.""

ííííThen Aeneas answered, ""Son of Peleus, think not that your wordscan scare me as though I were a child. I too, if I will, can bragand talk unseemly. We know one another's race and parentage as mattersof common fame, though neither have you ever seen my parents nor Iyours. Men say that you are son to noble Peleus, and that yourmother is Thetis, fair-haired daughter of the sea. I have nobleAnchises for my father, and Venus for my mother; the parents of one orother of us shall this day mourn a son, for it will be more than sillytalk that shall part us when the fight is over. Learn, then, mylineage if you will- and it is known to many.

íííí""In the beginning Dardanus was the son of Jove, and foundedDardania, for Ilius was not yet stablished on the plain for men todwell in, and her people still abode on the spurs of many-fountainedIda. Dardanus had a son, king Erichthonius, who was wealthiest ofall men living; he had three thousand mares that fed by thewater-meadows, they and their foals with them. Boreas was enamoured ofthem as they were feeding, and covered them in the semblance of adark-maned stallion. Twelve filly foals did they conceive and bearhim, and these, as they sped over the rich plain, would go bounding onover the ripe ears of corn and not break them; or again when theywould disport themselves on the broad back of Ocean they couldgallop on the crest of a breaker. Erichthonius begat Tros, king of theTrojans, and Tros had three noble sons, Ilus, Assaracus, andGanymede who was comeliest of mortal men; wherefore the gods carriedhim off to be Jove's cupbearer, for his beauty's sake, that he mightdwell among the immortals. Ilus begat Laomedon, and Laomedon begatTithonus, Priam, Lampus, Clytius, and Hiketaon of the stock of Mars.But Assaracus was father to Capys, and Capys to Anchises, who was myfather, while Hector is son to Priam.

íííí""Such do I declare my blood and lineage, but as for valour, Jovegives it or takes it as he will, for he is lord of all. And now letthere be no more of this prating in mid-battle as though we werechildren. We could fling taunts without end at one another; ahundred-oared galley would not hold them. The tongue can run allwhithers and talk all wise; it can go here and there, and as a mansays, so shall he be gainsaid. What is the use of our bandying hardlike women who when they fall foul of one another go out and wranglein the streets, one half true and the other lies, as rage inspiresthem? No words of yours shall turn me now that I am fain to fight-therefore let us make trial of one another with our spears.""

ííííAs he spoke he drove his spear at the great and terrible shield ofAchilles, which rang out as the point struck it. The son of Peleusheld the shield before him with his strong hand, and he was afraid,for he deemed that Aeneas's spear would go through it quite easily,not reflecting that the god's glorious gifts were little likely toyield before the blows of mortal men; and indeed Aeneas's spear didnot pierce the shield, for the layer of gold, gift of the god,stayed the point. It went through two layers, but the god had made theshield in five, two of bronze, the two innermost ones of tin, andone of gold; it was in this that the spear was stayed.

ííííAchilles in his turn threw, and struck the round shield of Aeneas atthe very edge, where the bronze was thinnest; the spear of Pelianash went clean through, and the shield rang under the blow; Aeneas wasafraid, and crouched backwards, holding the shield away from him;the spear, however, flew over his back, and stuck quivering in theground, after having gone through both circles of the shelteringshield. Aeneas though he had avoided the spear, stood still, blindedwith fear and grief because the weapon had gone so near him; thenAchilles sprang furiously upon him, with a cry as of death and withhis keen blade drawn, and Aeneas seized a great stone, so huge thattwo men, as men now are, would be unable to lift it, but Aeneaswielded it quite easily.

ííííAeneas would then have struck Achilles as he was springing towardshim, either on the helmet, or on the shield that covered him, andAchilles would have closed with him and despatched him with his sword,had not Neptune lord of the earthquake been quick to mark, and saidforthwith to the immortals, ""Alas, I am sorry for great Aeneas, whowill now go down to the house of Hades, vanquished by the son ofPeleus. Fool that he was to give ear to the counsel of Apollo.Apollo will never save him from destruction. Why should this mansuffer when he is guiltless, to no purpose, and in another'squarrel? Has he not at all times offered acceptable sacrifice to thegods that dwell in heaven? Let us then snatch him from death's jaws,lest the son of Saturn be angry should Achilles slay him. It is fated,moreover, that he should escape, and that the race of Dardanus, whomJove loved above all the sons born to him of mortal women, shall notperish utterly without seed or sign. For now indeed has Jove hated theblood of Priam, while Aeneas shall reign over the Trojans, he andhis children's children that shall be born hereafter.""

ííííThen answered Juno, ""Earth-shaker, look to this matter yourself, andconsider concerning Aeneas, whether you will save him, or sufferhim, brave though he be, to fall by the hand of Achilles son ofPeleus. For of a truth we two, I and Pallas Minerva, have sworn fullmany a time before all the immortals, that never would we shieldTrojans from destruction, not even when all Troy is burning in theflames that the Achaeans shall kindle.""

ííííWhen earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went into the battleamid the clash of spears, and came to the place where Achilles andAeneas were. Forthwith he shed a darkness before the eyes of the sonof Peleus, drew the bronze-headed ashen spear from the shield ofAeneas, and laid it at the feet of Achilles. Then he lifted Aeneason high from off the earth and hurried him away. Over the heads ofmany a band of warriors both horse and foot did he soar as the god'shand sped him, till he came to the very fringe of the battle where theCauconians were arming themselves for fight. Neptune, shaker of theearth, then came near to him and said, Aeneas, what god has eggedyou on to this folly in fighting the son of Peleus, who is both amightier man of valour and more beloved of heaven than you are? Giveway before him whensoever you meet him, lest you go down to thehouse of Hades even though fate would have it otherwise. When Achillesis dead you may then fight among the foremost undaunted, for noneother of the Achaeans shall slay you.""

ííííThe god left him when he had given him these instructions, and atonce removed the darkness from before the eyes of Achilles, who openedthem wide indeed and said in great anger, ""Alas! what marvel am Inow beholding? Here is my spear upon the ground, but I see not himwhom I meant to kill when I hurled it. Of a truth Aeneas also mustbe under heaven's protection, although I had thought his boastingwas idle. Let him go hang; he will be in no mood to fight mefurther, seeing how narrowly he has missed being killed. I will nowgive my orders to the Danaans and attack some other of the Trojans.""

ííííHe sprang forward along the line and cheered his men on as he didso. ""Let not the Trojans,"" he cried, ""keep you at arm's length,Achaeans, but go for them and fight them man for man. Howevervaliant I may be, I cannot give chase to so many and fight all ofthem. Even Mars, who is an immortal, or Minerva, would shrink fromflinging himself into the jaws of such a fight and laying about him;nevertheless, so far as in me lies I will show no slackness of hand orfoot nor want of endurance, not even for a moment; I will utterlybreak their ranks, and woe to the Trojan who shall venture withinreach of my spear.""

ííííThus did he exhort them. Meanwhile Hector called upon the Trojansand declared that he would fight Achilles. ""Be not afraid, proudTrojans,"" said he, ""to face the son of Peleus; I could fight godsmyself if the battle were one of words only, but they would be morethan a match for me, if we had to use our spears. Even so the deedof Achilles will fall somewhat short of his word; he will do inpart, and the other part he will clip short. I will go up againsthim though his hands be as fire- though his hands be fire and hisstrength iron.""

ííííThus urged the Trojans lifted up their spears against theAchaeans, and raised the cry of battle as they flung themselves intothe midst of their ranks. But Phoebus Apollo came up to Hector andsaid, ""Hector, on no account must you challenge Achilles to singlecombat; keep a lookout for him while you are under cover of the othersand away from the thick of the fight, otherwise he will either hit youwith a spear or cut you down at close quarters.""

ííííThus he spoke, and Hector drew back within the crowd, for he wasafraid when he heard what the god had said to him. Achilles thensprang upon the Trojans with a terrible cry, clothed in valour as witha garment. First he killed Iphition son of Otrynteus, a leader of muchpeople whom a naiad nymph had borne to Otrynteus waster of cities,in the land of Hyde under the snowy heights of Mt. Tmolus. Achillesstruck him full on the head as he was coming on towards him, and splitit clean in two; whereon he fell heavily to the ground and Achillesvaunted over him saying, ""You he low, son of Otrynteus, mighty hero;your death is here, but your lineage is on the Gygaean lake where yourfather's estate lies, by Hyllus, rich in fish, and the eddyingwaters of Hermus.""

ííííThus did he vaunt, but darkness closed the eyes of the other. Thechariots of the Achaeans cut him up as their wheels passed over him inthe front of the battle, and after him Achilles killed Demoleon, avaliant man of war and son to Antenor. He struck him on the templethrough his bronze-cheeked helmet. The helmet did not stay thespear, but it went right on, crushing the bone so that the braininside was shed in all directions, and his lust of fighting was ended.Then he struck Hippodamas in the midriff as he was springing down fromhis chariot in front of him, and trying to escape. He breathed hislast, bellowing like a bull bellows when young men are dragging him tooffer him in sacrifice to the King of Helice, and the heart of theearth-shaker is glad; even so did he bellow as he lay dying.Achilles then went in pursuit of Polydorus son of Priam, whom hisfather had always forbidden to fight because he was the youngest ofhis sons, the one he loved best, and the fastest runner. He, in hisfolly and showing off the fleetness of his feet, was rushing aboutamong front ranks until he lost his life, for Achilles struck him inthe middle of the back as he was darting past him: he struck himjust at the golden fastenings of his belt and where the two piecesof the double breastplate overlapped. The point of the spear piercedhim through and came out by the navel, whereon he fell groaning onto his knees and a cloud of darkness overshadowed him as he sankholding his entrails in his hands.

ííííWhen Hector saw his brother Polydorus with his entrails in his handsand sinking down upon the ground, a mist came over his eyes, and hecould not bear to keep longer at a distance; he therefore poised hisspear and darted towards Achilles like a flame of fire. WhenAchilles saw him he bounded forward and vaunted saying, ""This is hethat has wounded my heart most deeply and has slain my belovedcomrade. Not for long shall we two quail before one another on thehighways of war.""

ííííHe looked fiercely on Hector and said, ""Draw near, that you may meetyour doom the sooner."" Hector feared him not and answered, ""Son ofPeleus, think not that your words can scare me as though I were achild; I too if I will can brag and talk unseemly; I know that you area mighty warrior, mightier by far than I, nevertheless the issuelies in the the lap of heaven whether I, worse man though I be, maynot slay you with my spear, for this too has been found keen ere now.""

ííííHe hurled his spear as he spoke, but Minerva breathed upon it, andthough she breathed but very lightly she turned it back from goingtowards Achilles, so that it returned to Hector and lay at his feet infront of him. Achilles then sprang furiously on him with a loud cry,bent on killing him, but Apollo caught him up easily as a god can, andhid him in a thick darkness. Thrice did Achilles spring towards himspear in hand, and thrice did he waste his blow upon the air. Whenhe rushed forward for the fourth time as though he were a god, heshouted aloud saying, ""Hound, this time too you have escaped death-but of a truth it came exceedingly near you. Phoebus Apollo, to whomit seems you pray before you go into battle, has again saved you;but if I too have any friend among the gods I will surely make anend of you when I come across you at some other time. Now, however,I will pursue and overtake other Trojans.""

ííííOn this he struck Dryops with his spear, about the middle of hisneck, and he fell headlong at his feet. There he let him lie andstayed Demouchus son of Philetor, a man both brave and of greatstature, by hitting him on the knee with a spear; then he smote himwith his sword and killed him. After this he sprang on Laogonus andDardanus, sons of Bias, and threw them from their chariot, the onewith a blow from a thrown spear, while the other he cut down inhand-to-hand fight. There was also Tros the son of Alastor- he came upto Achilles and clasped his knees in the hope that he would sparehim and not kill him but let him go, because they were both of thesame age. Fool, he might have known that he should not prevail withhim, for the man was in no mood for pity or forbearance but was ingrim earnest. Therefore when Tros laid hold of his knees and soughta hearing for his prayers, Achilles drove his sword into his liver,and the liver came rolling out, while his bosom was all covered withthe black blood that welled from the wound. Thus did death close hiseyes as he lay lifeless.

ííííAchilles then went up to Mulius and struck him on the ear with aspear, and the bronze spear-head came right out at the other ear. Healso struck Echeclus son of Agenor on the head with his sword, whichbecame warm with the blood, while death and stern fate closed the eyesof Echeclus. Next in order the bronze point of his spear woundedDeucalion in the fore-arm where the sinews of the elbow are united,whereon he waited Achilles' onset with his arm hanging down anddeath staring him in the face. Achilles cut his head off with a blowfrom his sword and flung it helmet and all away from him, and themarrow came oozing out of his backbone as he lay. He then went inpursuit of Rhigmus, noble son of Peires, who had come from fertileThrace, and struck him through the middle with a spear which fixeditself in his belly, so that he fell headlong from his chariot. Healso speared Areithous squire to Rhigmus in the back as he was turninghis horses in flight, and thrust him from his chariot, while thehorses were struck with panic.

ííííAs a fire raging in some mountain glen after long drought- and thedense forest is in a blaze, while the wind carries great tongues offire in every direction- even so furiously did Achilles rage, wieldinghis spear as though he were a god, and giving chase to those whom hewould slay, till the dark earth ran with blood. Or as one who yokesbroad-browed oxen that they may tread barley in a threshing-floor- andit is soon bruised small under the feet of the lowing cattle- evenso did the horses of Achilles trample on the shields and bodies of theslain. The axle underneath and the railing that ran round the car werebespattered with clots of blood thrown up by the horses' hoofs, andfrom the tyres of the wheels; but the son of Peleus pressed on towin still further glory, and his hands were bedrabbled with gore.

ííííBOOK XXI

ííííNOW when they came to the ford of the full-flowing river Xanthus,begotten of immortal Jove, Achilles cut their forces in two: onehalf he chased over the plain towards the city by the same way thatthe Achaeans had taken when flying panic-stricken on the preceding daywith Hector in full triumph; this way did they fly pell-mell, and Junosent down a thick mist in front of them to stay them. The other halfwere hemmed in by the deep silver-eddying stream, and fell into itwith a great uproar. The waters resounded, and the banks rang again,as they swam hither and thither with loud cries amid the whirlingeddies. As locusts flying to a river before the blast of a grass fire-the flame comes on and on till at last it overtakes them and theyhuddle into the water- even so was the eddying stream of Xanthusfilled with the uproar of men and horses, all struggling inconfusion before Achilles.

ííííForthwith the hero left his spear upon the bank, leaning itagainst a tamarisk bush, and plunged into the river like a god,armed with his sword only. Fell was his purpose as he hewed theTrojans down on every side. Their dying groans rose hideous as thesword smote them, and the river ran red with blood. As when fish flyscared before a huge dolphin, and fill every nook and corner of somefair haven- for he is sure to eat all he can catch- even so did theTrojans cower under the banks of the mighty river, and whenAchilles' arms grew weary with killing them, he drew twelve youthsalive out of the water, to sacrifice in revenge for Patroclus son ofMenoetius. He drew them out like dazed fawns, bound their hands behindthem with the girdles of their own shirts, and gave them over to hismen to take back to the ships. Then he sprang into the river,thirsting for still further blood.

ííííThere he found Lycaon, son of Priam seed of Dardanus, as he wasescaping out of the water; he it was whom he had once taken prisonerwhen he was in his father's vineyard, having set upon him by night, ashe was cutting young shoots from a wild fig-tree to make the wickersides of a chariot. Achilles then caught him to his sorrow unawares,and sent him by sea to Lemnos, where the son of Jason bought him.But a guest-friend, Eetion of Imbros, freed him with a great sum,and sent him to Arisbe, whence he had escaped and returned to hisfather's house. He had spent eleven days happily with his friendsafter he had come from Lemnos, but on the twelfth heaven againdelivered him into the hands of Achilles, who was to send him to thehouse of Hades sorely against his will. He was unarmed when Achillescaught sight of him, and had neither helmet nor shield; nor yet had heany spear, for he had thrown all his armour from him on to the bank,and was sweating with his struggles to get out of the river, so thathis strength was now failing him.

ííííThen Achilles said to himself in his surprise, ""What marvel do I seehere? If this man can come back alive after having been sold over intoLemnos, I shall have the Trojans also whom I have slain rising fromthe world below. Could not even the waters of the grey sea imprisonhim, as they do many another whether he will or no? This time lethim taste my spear, that I may know for certain whether mother earthwho can keep even a strong man down, will be able to hold him, orwhether thence too he will return.""

ííííThus did he pause and ponder. But Lycaon came up to him dazed andtrying hard to embrace his knees, for he would fain live, not die.Achilles thrust at him with his spear, meaning to kill him, but Lycaonran crouching up to him and caught his knees, whereby the spear passedover his back, and stuck in the ground, hungering though it was forblood. With one hand he caught Achilles' knees as he besought him, andwith the other he clutched the spear and would not let it go. Thenhe said, ""Achilles, have mercy upon me and spare me, for I am yoursuppliant. It was in your tents that I first broke bread on the daywhen you took me prisoner in the vineyard; after which you sold awayto Lemnos far from my father and my friends, and I brought you theprice of a hundred oxen. I have paid three times as much to gain myfreedom; it is but twelve days that I have come to Ilius after muchsuffering, and now cruel fate has again thrown me into your hands.Surely father Jove must hate me, that he has given me over to you asecond time. Short of life indeed did my mother Laothoe bear me,daughter of aged Altes- of Altes who reigns over the warlike Lelegaeand holds steep Pedasus on the river Satnioeis. Priam married hisdaughter along with many other women and two sons were born of her,both of whom you will have slain. Your spear slew noble Polydorus ashe was fighting in the front ranks, and now evil will here befallme, for I fear that I shall not escape you since heaven has deliveredme over to you. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart,spare me, for I am not of the same womb as Hector who slew yourbrave and noble comrade.""

ííííWith such words did the princely son of Priam beseech Achilles;but Achilles answered him sternly. ""Idiot,"" said he, ""talk not to meof ransom. Until Patroclus fell I preferred to give the Trojansquarter, and sold beyond the sea many of those whom I had taken alive;but now not a man shall live of those whom heaven delivers into myhands before the city of Ilius- and of all Trojans it shall farehardest with the sons of Priam. Therefore, my friend, you too shalldie. Why should you whine in this way? Patroclus fell, and he was abetter man than you are. I too- see you not how I am great and goodly?I am son to a noble father, and have a goddess for my mother, butthe hands of doom and death overshadow me all as surely. The daywill come, either at dawn or dark, or at the noontide, when oneshall take my life also in battle, either with his spear, or with anarrow sped from his bow.""

ííííThus did he speak, and Lycaon's heart sank within him. He loosed hishold of the spear, and held out both hands before him; but Achillesdrew his keen blade, and struck him by the collar-bone on his neck; heplunged his two-edged sword into him to the very hilt, whereon helay at full length on the ground, with the dark blood welling from himtill the earth was soaked. Then Achilles caught him by the foot andflung him into the river to go down stream, vaunting over him thewhile, and saying, ""Lie there among the fishes, who will lick theblood from your wound and gloat over it; your mother shall not lay youon any bier to mourn you, but the eddies of Scamander shall bear youinto the broad bosom of the sea. There shall the fishes feed on thefat of Lycaon as they dart under the dark ripple of the waters- soperish all of you till we reach the citadel of strong Ilius- you inflight, and I following after to destroy you. The river with its broadsilver stream shall serve you in no stead, for all the bulls youoffered him and all the horses that you flung living into hiswaters. None the less miserably shall you perish till there is not aman of you but has paid in full for the death of Patroclus and thehavoc you wrought among the Achaeans whom you have slain while Iheld aloof from battle.""

ííííSo spoke Achilles, but the river grew more and more angry, andpondered within himself how he should stay the hand of Achilles andsave the Trojans from disaster. Meanwhile the son of Peleus, spearin hand, sprang upon Asteropaeus son of Pelegon to kill him. He wasson to the broad river Axius and Periboea eldest daughter ofAcessamenus; for the river had lain with her. Asteropaeus stood up outof the water to face him with a spear in either hand, and Xanthusfilled him with courage, being angry for the death of the youthswhom Achilles was slaying ruthlessly within his waters. When they wereclose up with one another Achilles was first to speak. ""Who and whenceare you,"" said he, ""who dare to face me? Woe to the parents whoseson stands up against me."" And the son of Pelegon answered, ""Great sonof Peleus, why should you ask my lineage. I am from the fertile landof far Paeonia, captain of the Paeonians, and it is now eleven daysthat I am at Ilius. I am of the blood of the river Axius- of Axiusthat is the fairest of all rivers that run. He begot the famed warriorPelegon, whose son men call me. Let us now fight, Achilles.""

ííííThus did he defy him, and Achilles raised his spear of Pelian ash.Asteropaeus failed with both his spears, for he could use both handsalike; with the one spear he struck Achilles' shield, but did notpierce it, for the layer of gold, gift of the god, stayed the point;with the other spear he grazed the elbow of Achilles! right armdrawing dark blood, but the spear itself went by him and fixeditself in the ground, foiled of its bloody banquet. Then Achilles,fain to kill him, hurled his spear at Asteropaeus, but failed to hithim and struck the steep bank of the river, driving the spear half itslength into the earth. The son of Peleus then drew his sword andsprang furiously upon him. Asteropaeus vainly tried to drawAchilles' spear out of the bank by main force; thrice did he tug atit, trying with all his might to draw it out, and thrice he had toleave off trying; the fourth time he tried to bend and break it, butere he could do so Achilles smote him with his sword and killed him.He struck him in the belly near the navel, so that all his bowels camegushing out on to the ground, and the darkness of death came overhim as he lay gasping. Then Achilles set his foot on his chest andspoiled him of his armour, vaunting over him and saying, ""Lie there-begotten of a river though you be, it is hard for you to strive withthe offspring of Saturn's son. You declare yourself sprung from theblood of a broad river, but I am of the seed of mighty Jove. My fatheris Peleus, son of Aeacus ruler over the many Myrmidons, and Aeacus wasthe son of Jove. Therefore as Jove is mightier than any river thatflows into the sea, so are his children stronger than those of anyriver whatsoever. Moreover you have a great river hard by if he can beof any use to you, but there is no fighting against Jove the son ofSaturn, with whom not even King Achelous can compare, nor the mightystream of deep-flowing Oceanus, from whom all rivers and seas with allsprings and deep wells proceed; even Oceanus fears the lightnings ofgreat Jove, and his thunder that comes crashing out of heaven.""

ííííWith this he drew his bronze spear out of the bank, and now thathe had killed Asteropaeus, he let him lie where he was on the sand,with the dark water flowing over him and the eels and fishes busynibbling and gnawing the fat that was about his kidneys. Then hewent in chase of the Paeonians, who were flying along the bank ofthe river in panic when they saw their leader slain by the hands ofthe son of Peleus. Therein he slew Thersilochus, Mydon, Astypylus,Mnesus, Thrasius, Oeneus, and Ophelestes, and he would have slainyet others, had not the river in anger taken human form, and spoken tohim from out the deep waters saying, ""Achilles, if you excel all instrength, so do you also in wickedness, for the gods are ever with youto protect you: if, then, the son of Saturn has vouchsafed it to youto destroy all the Trojans, at any rate drive them out of my stream,and do your grim work on land. My fair waters are now filled withcorpses, nor can I find any channel by which I may pour myself intothe sea for I am choked with dead, and yet you go on mercilesslyslaying. I am in despair, therefore, O captain of your host, troubleme no further.""

ííííAchilles answered, ""So be it, Scamander, Jove-descended; but Iwill never cease dealing out death among the Trojans, till I have pentthem up in their city, and made trial of Hector face to face, that Imay learn whether he is to vanquish me, or I him.""

ííííAs he spoke he set upon the Trojans with a fury like that of thegods. But the river said to Apollo, ""Surely, son of Jove, lord ofthe silver bow, you are not obeying the commands of Jove who chargedyou straitly that you should stand by the Trojans and defend them,till twilight fades, and darkness is over an the earth.""

ííííMeanwhile Achilles sprang from the bank into mid-stream, whereon theriver raised a high wave and attacked him. He swelled his streaminto a torrent, and swept away the many dead whom Achilles had slainand left within his waters. These he cast out on to the land,bellowing like a bull the while, but the living he saved alive, hidingthem in his mighty eddies. The great and terrible wave gatheredabout Achilles, falling upon him and beating on his shield, so that hecould not keep his feet; he caught hold of a great elm-tree, but itcame up by the roots, and tore away the bank, damming the streamwith its thick branches and bridging it all across; whereby Achillesstruggled out of the stream, and fled full speed over the plain, forhe was afraid.

ííííBut the mighty god ceased not in his pursuit, and sprang upon himwith a dark-crested wave, to stay his hands and save the Trojansfrom destruction. The son of Peleus darted away a spear's throw fromhim; swift as the swoop of a black hunter-eagle which is the strongestand fleetest of all birds, even so did he spring forward, and thearmour rang loudly about his breast. He fled on in front, but theriver with a loud roar came tearing after. As one who would waterhis garden leads a stream from some fountain over his plants, andall his ground-spade in hand he clears away the dams to free thechannels, and the little stones run rolling round and round with thewater as it goes merrily down the bank faster than the man can follow-even so did the river keep catching up with Achilles albeit he was afleet runner, for the gods are stronger than men. As often as he wouldstrive to stand his ground, and see whether or no all the gods inheaven were in league against him, so often would the mighty wave comebeating down upon his shoulders, and be would have to keep flying onand on in great dismay; for the angry flood was tiring him out as itflowed past him and ate the ground from under his feet.

ííííThen the son of Peleus lifted up his voice to heaven saying, ""FatherJove, is there none of the gods who will take pity upon me, and saveme from the river? I do not care what may happen to me afterwards. Iblame none of the other dwellers on Olympus so severely as I do mydear mother, who has beguiled and tricked me. She told me I was tofall under the walls of Troy by the flying arrows of Apollo; wouldthat Hector, the best man among the Trojans, might there slay me; thenshould I fall a hero by the hand of a hero; whereas now it seemsthat I shall come to a most pitiable end, trapped in this river asthough I were some swineherd's boy, who gets carried down a torrentwhile trying to cross it during a storm.""

ííííAs soon as he had spoken thus, Neptune and Minerva came up to him inthe likeness of two men, and took him by the hand to reassure him.Neptune spoke first. ""Son of Peleus,"" said he, ""be not so exceedingfearful; we are two gods, come with Jove's sanction to assist you,I, and Pallas Minerva. It is not your fate to perish in this river; hewill abate presently as you will see; moreover we strongly advise you,if you will be guided by us, not to stay your hand from fightingtill you have pent the Trojan host within the famed walls of Ilius- asmany of them as may escape. Then kill Hector and go back to the ships,for we will vouchsafe you a triumph over him.""

ííííWhen they had so said they went back to the other immortals, butAchilles strove onward over the plain, encouraged by the charge thegods had laid upon him. All was now covered with the flood ofwaters, and much goodly armour of the youths that had been slain wasrifting about, as also many corpses, but he forced his way against thestream, speeding right onwards, nor could the broad waters stay him,for Minerva had endowed him with great strength. NeverthelessScamander did not slacken in his pursuit, but was still more furiouswith the son of Peleus. He lifted his waters into a high crest andcried aloud to Simois saying, ""Dear brother, let the two of us uniteto save this man, or he will sack the mighty city of King Priam, andthe Trojans will not hold out against him. Help me at once; fillyour streams with water from their sources, rouse all your torrents toa fury; raise your wave on high, and let snags and stones comethundering down you that we may make an end of this savage creaturewho is now lording it as though he were a god. Nothing shall serve himlonger, not strength nor comeliness, nor his fine armour, whichforsooth shall soon be lying low in the deep waters covered overwith mud. I will wrap him in sand, and pour tons of shingle round him,so that the Achaeans shall not know how to gather his bones for thesilt in which I shall have hidden him, and when they celebrate hisfuneral they need build no barrow.""

ííííOn this he upraised his tumultuous flood high against Achilles,seething as it was with foam and blood and the bo&ies of the dead. Thedark waters of the river stood upright and would have overwhelmedthe son of Peleus, but Juno, trembling lest Achilles should be sweptaway in the mighty torrent, lifted her voice on high and called out toVulcan her son. ""Crook-foot,"" she cried, ""my child, be up and doing,for I deem it is with you that Xanthus is fain to fight; help us atonce, kindle a fierce fire; I will then bring up the west and thewhite south wind in a mighty hurricane from the sea, that shall bearthe flames against the heads and armour of the Trojans and consumethem, while you go along the banks of Xanthus burning his trees andwrapping him round with fire. Let him not turn you back neither byfair words nor foul, and slacken not till I shout and tell you. Thenyou may stay your flames.""

ííííOn this Vulcan kindled a fierce fire, which broke out first upon theplain and burned the many dead whom Achilles had killed and whosebodies were lying about in great numbers; by this means the plainwas dried and the flood stayed. As the north wind, blowing on anorchard that has been sodden with autumn rain, soon dries it, andthe heart of the owner is glad- even so the whole plan was dried andthe dead bodies were consumed. Then he turned tongues of fire on tothe river. He burned the elms the willows and the tamarisks, the lotusalso, with the rushes and marshy herbage that grew abundantly by thebanks of the river. The eels and fishes that go darting abouteverywhere in the water, these, too, were sorely harassed by theflames that cunning Vulcan had kindled, and the river himself wasscalded, so that he spoke saying, ""Vulcan, there is no god can holdhis own against you. I cannot fight you when you flare out your flamesin this way; strive with me no longer. Let Achilles drive theTrojans out of city immediately. What have I to do with quarrellingand helping people?""

ííííHe was boiling as he spoke, and all his waters were seething. As acauldron upon 'a large fire boils when it is melting the lard ofsome fatted hog, and the lard keeps bubbling up all over when thedry faggots blaze under it- even so were the goodly waters ofXanthus heated with the fire till they were boiling. He could flowno longer but stayed his stream, so afflicted was he by the blastsof fire which cunning Vulcan had raised. Then he prayed to Juno andbesought her saying, ""Juno, why should your son vex my stream withsuch especial fury? I am not so much to blame as all the others arewho have been helping the Trojans. I will leave off, since you sodesire it, and let son leave off also. Furthermore I swear never againwill I do anything to save the Trojans from destruction, not even whenall Troy is burning in the flames which the Achaeans will kindle.""

ííííAs soon as Juno heard this she said to her son Vulcan, ""SonVulcan, hold now your flames; we ought not to use such violenceagainst a god for the sake of mortals.""

ííííWhen she had thus spoken Vulcan quenched his flames, and the riverwent back once more into his own fair bed.

ííííXanthus was now beaten, so these two left off fighting, for Junostayed them though she was still angry; but a furious quarrel brokeout among the other gods, for they were of divided counsels. They fellon one another with a mighty uproar- earth groaned, and the spaciousfirmament rang out as with a blare of trumpets. Jove heard as he wassitting on Olympus, and laughed for joy when he saw the gods coming toblows among themselves. They were not long about beginning, and Marspiercer of shields opened the battle. Sword in hand he sprang atonce upon Minerva and reviled her. ""Why, vixen,"" said he, ""have youagain set the gods by the ears in the pride and haughtiness of yourheart? Have you forgotten how you set Diomed son of Tydeus on to woundme, and yourself took visible spear and drove it into me to the hurtof my fair body? You shall now suffer for what you then did to me.""

ííííAs he spoke he struck her on the terrible tasselled aegis- soterrible that not even can Jove's lightning pierce it. Here didmurderous Mars strike her with his great spear. She drew back and withher strong hand seized a stone that was lying on the plain- greatand rugged and black- which men of old had set for the boundary of afield. With this she struck Mars on the neck, and brought him down.Nine roods did he cover in his fall, and his hair was all soiled inthe dust, while his armour rang rattling round him. But Minervalaughed and vaunted over him saying, ""Idiot, have you not learnedhow far stronger I am than you, but you must still match yourselfagainst me? Thus do your mother's curses now roost upon you, for sheis angry and would do you mischief because you have deserted theAchaeans and are helping the Trojans.""

ííííShe then turned her two piercing eyes elsewhere, whereon Jove'sdaughter Venus took Mars by the hand and led him away groaning all thetime, for it was only with great difficulty that he had come tohimself again. When Queen Juno saw her, she said to Minerva, ""Look,daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, that vixen Venus is againtaking Mars through the crowd out of the battle; go after her atonce.""

ííííThus she spoke. Minerva sped after Venus with a will, and made ather, striking her on the bosom with her strong hand so that she fellfainting to the ground, and there they both lay stretched at fulllength. Then Minerva vaunted over her saying, ""May all who help theTrojans against the Argives prove just as redoubtable and stalwartas Venus did when she came across me while she was helping Mars. Hadthis been so, we should long since have ended the war by sacking thestrong city of Ilius.""

ííííJuno smiled as she listened. Meanwhile King Neptune turned to Apollosaying, ""Phoebus, why should we keep each other at arm's length? it isnot well, now that the others have begun fighting; it will bedisgraceful to us if we return to Jove's bronze-floored mansion onOlympus without having fought each other; therefore come on, you arethe younger of the two, and I ought not to attack you, for I amolder and have had more experience. Idiot, you have no sense, andforget how we two alone of all the gods fared hardly round about Iliuswhen we came from Jove's house and worked for Laomedon a whole year ata stated wage and he gave us his orders. I built the Trojans thewall about their city, so wide and fair that it might beimpregnable, while you, Phoebus, herded cattle for him in the dales ofmany valleyed Ida. When, however, the glad hours brought round thetime of payment, mighty Laomedon robbed us of all our hire and sent usoff with nothing but abuse. He threatened to bind us hand and foot andsell us over into some distant island. He tried, moreover, to cutoff the ears of both of us, so we went away in a rage, furious aboutthe payment he had promised us, and yet withheld; in spite of allthis, you are now showing favour to his people, and will not join usin compassing the utter ruin of the proud Trojans with their wives andchildren.""

ííííAnd King Apollo answered, ""Lord of the earthquake, you would have norespect for me if I were to fight you about a pack of miserablemortals, who come out like leaves in summer and eat the fruit of thefield, and presently fall lifeless to the ground. Let us stay thisfighting at once and let them settle it among themselves.""

ííííHe turned away as he spoke, for he would lay no hand on thebrother of his own father. But his sister the huntress Diana,patroness of wild beasts, was very angry with him and said, ""So youwould fly, Far-Darter, and hand victory over to Neptune with a cheapvaunt to boot. Baby, why keep your bow thus idle? Never let me againhear you bragging in my father's house, as you have often done inthe presence of the immortals, that you would stand up and fightwith Neptune.""

ííííApollo made her no answer, but Jove's august queen was angry andupbraided her bitterly. ""Bold vixen,"" she cried, ""how dare you crossme thus? For all your bow you will find it hard to hold your ownagainst me. Jove made you as a lion among women, and lets you killthem whenever you choose. You will And it better to chase wildbeasts and deer upon the mountains than to fight those who arestronger than you are. If you would try war, do so, and find out bypitting yourself against me, how far stronger I am than you are.""

ííííShe caught both Diana's wrists with her left hand as she spoke,and with her right she took the bow from her shoulders, and laughed asshe beat her with it about the ears while Diana wriggled and writhedunder her blows. Her swift arrows were shed upon the ground, and shefled weeping from under Juno's hand as a dove that flies before afalcon to the cleft of some hollow rock, when it is her good fortuneto escape. Even so did she fly weeping away, leaving her bow andarrows behind her.

ííííThen the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, said to Leto, ""Leto, Ishall not fight you; it is ill to come to blows with any of Jove'swives. Therefore boast as you will among the immortals that youworsted me in fair fight.""

ííííLeto then gathered up Diana's bow and arrows that had fallen aboutamid the whirling dust, and when she had got them she made all hasteafter her daughter. Diana had now reached Jove's bronze-flooredmansion on Olympus, and sat herself down with many tears on theknees of her father, while her ambrosial raiment was quivering allabout her. The son of Saturn drew her towards him, and laughingpleasantly the while began to question her saying, ""Which of theheavenly beings, my dear child, has been treating you in this cruelmanner, as though you had been misconducting yourself in the face ofeverybody?"" and the fair-crowned goddess of the chase answered, ""Itwas your wife Juno, father, who has been beating me; it is alwaysher doing when there is any quarrelling among the immortals.""

ííííThus did they converse, and meanwhile Phoebus Apollo entered thestrong city of Ilius, for he was uneasy lest the wall should nothold out and the Danaans should take the city then and there, beforeits hour had come; but the rest of the ever-living gods went back,some angry and some triumphant to Olympus, where they took their seatsbeside Jove lord of the storm cloud, while Achilles still kept ondealing out death alike on the Trojans and on their As when thesmoke from some burning city ascends to heaven when the anger of thegods has kindled it- there is then toil for all, and sorrow for nota few- even so did Achilles bring toil and sorrow on the Trojans.

ííííOld King Priam stood on a high tower of the wall looking down onhuge Achilles as the Trojans fled panic-stricken before him, and therewas none to help them. Presently he came down from off the tower andwith many a groan went along the wall to give orders to the bravewarders of the gate. ""Keep the gates,"" said he, ""wide open till thepeople come flying into the city, for Achilles is hard by and isdriving them in rout before him. I see we are in great peril. Assoon as our people are inside and in safety, close the strong gatesfor I fear lest that terrible man should come bounding inside alongwith the others.""

ííííAs he spoke they drew back the bolts and opened the gates, andwhen these were opened there was a haven of refuge for the Trojans.Apollo then came full speed out of the city to meet them and protectthem. Right for the city and the high wall, parched with thirst andgrimy with dust, still they fied on, with Achilles wielding hisspear furiously behind them. For he was as one possessed, and wasthirsting after glory.

ííííThen had the sons of the Achaeans taken the lofty gates of Troy ifApollo had not spurred on Agenor, valiant and noble son to Antenor. Heput courage into his heart, and stood by his side to guard him,leaning against a beech tree and shrouded in thick darkness. WhenAgenor saw Achilles he stood still and his heart was clouded withcare. ""Alas,"" said he to himself in his dismay, ""if I fly beforemighty Achilles, and go where all the others are being driven in rout,he will none the less catch me and kill me for a coward. How wouldit be were I to let Achilles drive the others before him, and then flyfrom the wall to the plain that is behind Ilius till I reach the spursof Ida and can hide in the underwood that is thereon? I could thenwash the sweat from off me in the river and in the evening return toIlius. But why commune with myself in this way? Like enough he wouldsee me as I am hurrying from the city over the plain, and wouldspeed after me till he had caught me- I should stand no chance againsthim, for he is mightiest of all mankind. What, then, if I go out andmeet him in front of the city? His flesh too, I take it, can bepierced by pointed bronze. Life is the same in one and all, and mensay that he is but mortal despite the triumph that Jove son ofSaturn vouchsafes him.""

ííííSo saying he stood on his guard and awaited Achilles, for he was nowfain to fight him. As a leopardess that bounds from out a thick covertto attack a hunter- she knows no fear and is not dismayed by thebaying of the hounds; even though the man be too quick for her andwound her either with thrust or spear, still, though the spear haspierced her she will not give in till she has either caught him in hergrip or been killed outright- even so did noble Agenor son ofAntenor refuse to fly till he had made trial of Achilles, and took aimat him with his spear, holding his round shield before him andcrying with a loud voice. ""Of a truth,"" said he, ""noble Achilles,you deem that you shall this day sack the city of the proud Trojans.Fool, there will be trouble enough yet before it, for there is manya brave man of us still inside who will stand in front of our dearparents with our wives and children, to defend Ilius. Heretherefore, huge and mighty warrior though you be, here shall you cue.

ííííAs he spoke his strong hand hurled his javelin from him, and thespear struck Achilles on the leg beneath the knee; the greave of newlywrought tin rang loudly, but the spear recoiled from the body of himwhom it had struck, and did not pierce it, for the gods gift stayedit. Achilles in his turn attacked noble Agenor, but Apollo would notvouchsafe him glory, for he snatched Agenor away and hid him in athick mist, sending him out of the battle unmolested Then hecraftily drew the son of Peleus away from going after the host, for heput on the semblance of Agenor and stood in front of Achilles, who rantowards him to give him chase and pursued him over the corn lands ofthe plain, turning him towards the deep waters of the river Scamander.Apollo ran but a little way before him and beguiled Achilles by makinghim think all the time that he was on the point of overtaking him.Meanwhile the rabble of routed Trojans was thankful to crowd withinthe city till their numbers thronged it; no longer did they darewait for one another outside the city walls, to learn who hadescaped and who were fallen in fight, but all whose feet and kneescould still carry them poured pell-mell into the town.

ííííBOOK XXII

ííííTHUS the Trojans in the city, scared like fawns, wiped the sweatfrom off them and drank to quench their thirst, leaning against thegoodly battlements, while the Achaeans with their shields laid upontheir shoulders drew close up to the walls. But stern fate bade Hectorstay where he was before Ilius and the Scaean gates. Then PhoebusApollo spoke to the son of Peleus saying, ""Why, son of Peleus, do you,who are but man, give chase to me who am immortal? Have you not yetfound out that it is a god whom you pursue so furiously? You did notharass the Trojans whom you had routed, and now they are withintheir walls, while you have been decoyed hither away from them. Me youcannot kill, for death can take no hold upon me.""

ííííAchilles was greatly angered and said, ""You have baulked me,Far-Darter, most malicious of all gods, and have drawn me away fromthe wall, where many another man would have bitten the dust ere he gotwithin Ilius; you have robbed me of great glory and have saved theTrojans at no risk to yourself, for you have nothing to fear, but Iwould indeed have my revenge if it were in my power to do so.""

ííííOn this, with fell intent he made towards the city, and as thewinning horse in a chariot race strains every nerve when he isflying over the plain, even so fast and furiously did the limbs ofAchilles bear him onwards. King Priam was first to note him as hescoured the plain, all radiant as the star which men call Orion'sHound, and whose beams blaze forth in time of harvest more brilliantlythan those of any other that shines by night; brightest of them allthough he be, he yet bodes ill for mortals, for he brings fire andfever in his train- even so did Achilles' armour gleam on his breastas he sped onwards. Priam raised a cry and beat his head with hishands as he lifted them up and shouted out to his dear son,imploring him to return; but Hector still stayed before the gates, forhis heart was set upon doing battle with Achilles. The old man reachedout his arms towards him and bade him for pity's sake come withinthe walls. ""Hector,"" he cried, ""my son, stay not to face this manalone and unsupported, or you will meet death at the hands of theson of Peleus, for he is mightier than you. Monster that he is;would indeed that the gods loved him no better than I do, for so, dogsand vultures would soon devour him as he lay stretched on earth, and aload of grief would be lifted from my heart, for many a brave sonhas he reft from me, either by killing them or selling them away inthe islands that are beyond the sea: even now I miss two sons fromamong the Trojans who have thronged within the city, Lycaon andPolydorus, whom Laothoe peeress among women bore me. Should they bestill alive and in the hands of the Achaeans, we will ransom them withgold and bronze, of which we have store, for the old man Altes endowedhis daughter richly; but if they are already dead and in the houseof Hades, sorrow will it be to us two who were their parents; albeitthe grief of others will be more short-lived unless you too perishat the hands of Achilles. Come, then, my son, within the city, to bethe guardian of Trojan men and Trojan women, or you will both loseyour own life and afford a mighty triumph to the son of Peleus. Havepity also on your unhappy father while life yet remains to him- on me,whom the son of Saturn will destroy by a terrible doom on thethreshold of old age, after I have seen my sons slain and my daughtershaled away as captives, my bridal chambers pillaged, little childrendashed to earth amid the rage of battle, and my sons' wives draggedaway by the cruel hands of the Achaeans; in the end fierce hounds willtear me in pieces at my own gates after some one has beaten the lifeout of my body with sword or spear-hounds that I myself reared and fedat my own table to guard my gates, but who will yet lap my blood andthen lie all distraught at my doors. When a young man falls by thesword in battle, he may lie where he is and there is nothing unseemly;let what will be seen, all is honourable in death, but when an old manis slain there is nothing in this world more pitiable than that dogsshould defile his grey hair and beard and all that men hide forshame.""

ííííThe old man tore his grey hair as he spoke, but he moved not theheart of Hector. His mother hard by wept and moaned aloud as she baredher bosom and pointed to the breast which had suckled him. ""Hector,""she cried, weeping bitterly the while, ""Hector, my son, spurn not thisbreast, but have pity upon me too: if I have ever given you comfortfrom my own bosom, think on it now, dear son, and come within the wallto protect us from this man; stand not without to meet him. Should thewretch kill you, neither I nor your richly dowered wife shall everweep, dear offshoot of myself, over the bed on which you lie, for dogswill devour you at the ships of the Achaeans.""

ííííThus did the two with many tears implore their son, but they movednot the heart of Hector, and he stood his ground awaiting hugeAchilles as he drew nearer towards him. As serpent in its den upon themountains, full fed with deadly poisons, waits for the approach ofman- he is filled with fury and his eyes glare terribly as he goeswrithing round his den- even so Hector leaned his shield against atower that jutted out from the wall and stood where he was, undaunted.

íííí""Alas,"" said he to himself in the heaviness of his heart, ""if I gowithin the gates, Polydamas will be the first to heap reproach uponme, for it was he that urged me to lead the Trojans back to the cityon that awful night when Achilles again came forth against us. I wouldnot listen, but it would have been indeed better if I had done so. Nowthat my folly has destroyed the host, I dare not look Trojan men andTrojan women in the face, lest a worse man should say, 'Hector hasruined us by his self-confidence.' Surely it would be better for me toreturn after having fought Achilles and slain him, or to diegloriously here before the city. What, again, if were to lay down myshield and helmet, lean my spear against the wall and go straight upto noble Achilles? What if I were to promise to give up Helen, who wasthe fountainhead of all this war, and all the treasure that Alexandrusbrought with him in his ships to Troy, aye, and to let the Achaeansdivide the half of everything that the city contains among themselves?I might make the Trojans, by the mouths of their princes, take asolemn oath that they would hide nothing, but would divide into twoshares all that is within the city- but why argue with myself inthis way? Were I to go up to him he would show me no kind of mercy; hewould kill me then and there as easily as though I were a woman,when I had off my armour. There is no parleying with him from somerock or oak tree as young men and maidens prattle with one another.Better fight him at once, and learn to which of us Jove will vouchsafevictory.""

ííííThus did he stand and ponder, but Achilles came up to him as it wereMars himself, plumed lord of battle. From his right shoulder hebrandished his terrible spear of Pelian ash, and the bronze gleamedaround him like flashing fire or the rays of the rising sun. Fear fellupon Hector as he beheld him, and he dared not stay longer where hewas but fled in dismay from before the gates, while Achilles dartedafter him at his utmost speed. As a mountain falcon, swiftest of allbirds, swoops down upon some cowering dove- the dove flies beforehim but the falcon with a shrill scream follows close after,resolved to have her- even so did Achilles make straight for Hectorwith all his might, while Hector fled under the Trojan wall as fast ashis limbs could take him.

ííííOn they flew along the waggon-road that ran hard by under thewall, past the lookout station, and past the weather-beaten wildfig-tree, till they came to two fair springs which feed the riverScamander. One of these two springs is warm, and steam rises from itas smoke from a burning fire, but the other even in summer is ascold as hail or snow, or the ice that forms on water. Here, hard bythe springs, are the goodly washing-troughs of stone, where in thetime of peace before the coming of the Achaeans the wives and fairdaughters of the Trojans used to wash their clothes. Past these didthey fly, the one in front and the other giving ha. behind him: goodwas the man that fled, but better far was he that followed after,and swiftly indeed did they run, for the prize was no mere beast forsacrifice or bullock's hide, as it might be for a common foot-race,but they ran for the life of Hector. As horses in a chariot race speedround the turning-posts when they are running for some great prize-a tripod or woman- at the games in honour of some dead hero, so didthese two run full speed three times round the city of Priam. Allthe gods watched them, and the sire of gods and men was the first tospeak.

íííí""Alas,"" said he, ""my eyes behold a man who is dear to me beingpursued round the walls of Troy; my heart is full of pity forHector, who has burned the thigh-bones of many a heifer in myhonour, at one while on the of many-valleyed Ida, and again on thecitadel of Troy; and now I see noble Achilles in full pursuit of himround the city of Priam. What say you? Consider among yourselves anddecide whether we shall now save him or let him fall, valiant thoughhe be, before Achilles, son of Peleus.""

ííííThen Minerva said, ""Father, wielder of the lightning, lord ofcloud and storm, what mean you? Would you pluck this mortal whose doomhas long been decreed out of the jaws of death? Do as you will, but weothers shall not be of a mind with you.""

ííííAnd Jove answered, ""My child, Trito-born, take heart. I did notspeak in full earnest, and I will let you have your way. Do withoutlet or hindrance as you are minded.""

ííííThus did he urge Minerva who was already eager, and down shedarted from the topmost summits of Olympus.

ííííAchilles was still in full pursuit of Hector, as a hound chasing afawn which he has started from its covert on the mountains, andhunts through glade and thicket. The fawn may try to elude him bycrouching under cover of a bush, but he will scent her out andfollow her up until he gets her- even so there was no escape forHector from the fleet son of Peleus. Whenever he made a set to getnear the Dardanian gates and under the walls, that his people mighthelp him by showering down weapons from above, Achilles would gainon him and head him back towards the plain, keeping himself alwayson the city side. As a man in a dream who fails to lay hands uponanother whom he is pursuing- the one cannot escape nor the otherovertake- even so neither could Achilles come up with Hector, norHector break away from Achilles; nevertheless he might even yet haveescaped death had not the time come when Apollo, who thus far hadsustained his strength and nerved his running, was now no longer tostay by him. Achilles made signs to the Achaean host, and shook hishead to show that no man was to aim a dart at Hector, lest anothermight win the glory of having hit him and he might himself come insecond. Then, at last, as they were nearing the fountains for thefourth time, the father of all balanced his golden scales and placed adoom in each of them, one for Achilles and the other for Hector. As heheld the scales by the middle, the doom of Hector fell down deepinto the house of Hades- and then Phoebus Apollo left him. ThereonMinerva went close up to the son of Peleus and said, ""NobleAchilles, favoured of heaven, we two shall surely take back to theships a triumph for the Achaeans by slaying Hector, for all his lustof battle. Do what Apollo may as he lies grovelling before his father,aegis-bearing Jove, Hector cannot escape us longer. Stay here and takebreath, while I go up to him and persuade him to make a stand andfight you.""

ííííThus spoke Minerva. Achilles obeyed her gladly, and stood still,leaning on his bronze-pointed ashen spear, while Minerva left himand went after Hector in the form and with the voice of Deiphobus. Shecame close up to him and said, ""Dear brother, I see you are hardpressed by Achilles who is chasing you at full speed round the city ofPriam, let us await his onset and stand on our defence.""

ííííAnd Hector answered, ""Deiphobus, you have always been dearest tome of all my brothers, children of Hecuba and Priam, but henceforthI shall rate you yet more highly, inasmuch as you have venturedoutside the wall for my sake when all the others remain inside.""

ííííThen Minerva said, ""Dear brother, my father and mother went downon their knees and implored me, as did all my comrades, to remaininside, so great a fear has fallen upon them all; but I was in anagony of grief when I beheld you; now, therefore, let us two make astand and fight, and let there be no keeping our spears in reserve,that we may learn whether Achilles shall kill us and bear off ourspoils to the ships, or whether he shall fall before you.""

ííííThus did Minerva inveigle him by her cunning, and when the twowere now close to one another great Hector was first to speak. ""Iwill-no longer fly you, son of Peleus,"" said he, ""as I have been doinghitherto. Three times have I fled round the mighty city of Priam,without daring to withstand you, but now, let me either slay or beslain, for I am in the mind to face you. Let us, then, give pledges toone another by our gods, who are the fittest witnesses and guardiansof all covenants; let it be agreed between us that if Jovevouchsafes me the longer stay and I take your life, I am not totreat your dead body in any unseemly fashion, but when I have strippedyou of your armour, I am to give up your body to the Achaeans. Anddo you likewise.""

ííííAchilles glared at him and answered, ""Fool, prate not to me aboutcovenants. There can be no covenants between men and lions, wolves andlambs can never be of one mind, but hate each other out and out anthrough. Therefore there can be no understanding between you and me,nor may there be any covenants between us, till one or other shallfall and glut grim Mars with his life's blood. Put forth all yourstrength; you have need now to prove yourself indeed a bold soldierand man of war. You have no more chance, and Pallas Minerva willforthwith vanquish you by my spear: you shall now pay me in full forthe grief you have caused me on account of my comrades whom you havekilled in battle.""

ííííHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. Hector saw itcoming and avoided it; he watched it and crouched down so that it flewover his head and stuck in the ground beyond; Minerva then snatched itup and gave it back to Achilles without Hector's seeing her; Hectorthereon said to the son of Peleus, ""You have missed your aim,Achilles, peer of the gods, and Jove has not yet revealed to you thehour of my doom, though you made sure that he had done so. You werea false-tongued liar when you deemed that I should forget my valourand quail before you. You shall not drive spear into the back of arunaway- drive it, should heaven so grant you power, drive it intome as I make straight towards you; and now for your own part avoidmy spear if you can- would that you might receive the whole of it intoyour body; if you were once dead the Trojans would find the war aneasier matter, for it is you who have harmed them most.""

ííííHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. His aim was truefor he hit the middle of Achilles' shield, but the spear reboundedfrom it, and did not pierce it. Hector was angry when he saw thatthe weapon had sped from his hand in vain, and stood there in dismayfor he had no second spear. With a loud cry he called Diphobus andasked him for one, but there was no man; then he saw the truth andsaid to himself, ""Alas! the gods have lured me on to my destruction. Ideemed that the hero Deiphobus was by my side, but he is within thewall, and Minerva has inveigled me; death is now indeed exceedinglynear at hand and there is no way out of it- for so Jove and his sonApollo the far-darter have willed it, though heretofore they have beenever ready to protect me. My doom has come upon me; let me not thendie ingloriously and without a struggle, but let me first do somegreat thing that shall be told among men hereafter.""

ííííAs he spoke he drew the keen blade that hung so great and strongby his side, and gathering himself together be sprang on Achilles likea soaring eagle which swoops down from the clouds on to some lamb ortimid hare- even so did Hector brandish his sword and spring uponAchilles. Achilles mad with rage darted towards him, with his wondrousshield before his breast, and his gleaming helmet, made with fourlayers of metal, nodding fiercely forward. The thick tresses of goldwi which Vulcan had crested the helmet floated round it, and as theevening star that shines brighter than all others through thestillness of night, even such was the gleam of the spear whichAchilles poised in his right hand, fraught with the death of nobleHector. He eyed his fair flesh over and over to see where he couldbest wound it, but all was protected by the goodly armour of whichHector had spoiled Patroclus after he had slain him, save only thethroat where the collar-bones divide the neck from the shoulders,and this is a most deadly place: here then did Achilles strike himas he was coming on towards him, and the point of his spear went rightthrough the fleshy part of the neck, but it did not sever his windpipeso that he could still speak. Hector fell headlong, and Achillesvaunted over him saying, ""Hector, you deemed that you should comeoff scatheless when you were spoiling Patroclus, and recked not ofmyself who was not with him. Fool that you were: for I, his comrade,mightier far than he, was still left behind him at the ships, andnow I have laid you low. The Achaeans shall give him all due funeralrites, while dogs and vultures shall work their will upon yourself.""

ííííThen Hector said, as the life ebbed out of him, ""I pray you byyour life and knees, and by your parents, let not dogs devour me atthe ships of the Achaeans, but accept the rich treasure of gold andbronze which my father and mother will offer you, and send my bodyhome, that the Trojans and their wives may give me my dues of firewhen I am dead.""

ííííAchilles glared at him and answered, ""Dog, talk not to me neither ofknees nor parents; would that I could be as sure of being able tocut your flesh into pieces and eat it raw, for the ill have done me,as I am that nothing shall save you from the dogs- it shall not be,though they bring ten or twenty-fold ransom and weigh it out for me onthe spot, with promise of yet more hereafter. Though Priam son ofDardanus should bid them offer me your weight in gold, even so yourmother shall never lay you out and make lament over the son shebore, but dogs and vultures shall eat you utterly up.""

ííííHector with his dying breath then said, ""I know you what you are,and was sure that I should not move you, for your heart is hard asiron; look to it that I bring not heaven's anger upon you on the daywhen Paris and Phoebus Apollo, valiant though you be, shall slay youat the Scaean gates.""

ííííWhen he had thus said the shrouds of death enfolded him, whereon hissoul went out of him and flew down to the house of Hades, lamentingits sad fate that it should en' youth and strength no longer. ButAchilles said, speaking to the dead body, ""Die; for my part I willaccept my fate whensoever Jove and the other gods see fit to send it.""

ííííAs he spoke he drew his spear from the body and set it on oneside; then he stripped the blood-stained armour from Hector'sshoulders while the other Achaeans came running up to view hiswondrous strength and beauty; and no one came near him withoutgiving him a fresh wound. Then would one turn to his neighbour andsay, ""It is easier to handle Hector now than when he was flinging fireon to our ships"" and as he spoke he would thrust his spear into himanew.

ííííWhen Achilles had done spoiling Hector of his armour, he stood amongthe Argives and said, ""My friends, princes and counsellors of theArgives, now that heaven has vouchsafed us to overcome this man, whohas done us more hurt than all the others together, consider whetherwe should not attack the city in force, and discover in what mindthe Trojans may be. We should thus learn whether they will deserttheir city now that Hector has fallen, or will still hold out eventhough he is no longer living. But why argue with myself in thisway, while Patroclus is still lying at the ships unburied, andunmourned- he Whom I can never forget so long as I am alive and mystrength fails not? Though men forget their dead when once they arewithin the house of Hades, yet not even there will I forget thecomrade whom I have lost. Now, therefore, Achaean youths, let us raisethe song of victory and go back to the ships taking this man alongwith us; for we have achieved a mighty triumph and have slain nobleHector to whom the Trojans prayed throughout their city as though hewere a god.""

ííííOn this he treated the body of Hector with contumely: he pierced thesinews at the back of both his feet from heel to ancle and passedthongs of ox-hide through the slits he had made: thus he made the bodyfast to his chariot, letting the head trail upon the ground. Then whenhe had put the goodly armour on the chariot and had himself mounted,he lashed his horses on and they flew forward nothing loth. The dustrose from Hector as he was being dragged along, his dark hair flew allabroad, and his head once so comely was laid low on earth, for Jovehad now delivered him into the hands of his foes to do him outragein his own land.

ííííThus was the head of Hector being dishonoured in the dust. Hismother tore her hair, and flung her veil from her with a loud cry asshe looked upon her son. His father made piteous moan, andthroughout the city the people fell to weeping and wailing. It wasas though the whole of frowning Ilius was being smirched with fire.Hardly could the people hold Priam back in his hot haste to rushwithout the gates of the city. He grovelled in the mire and besoughtthem, calling each one of them by his name. ""Let be, my friends,"" hecried, ""and for all your sorrow, suffer me to go single-handed tothe ships of the Achaeans. Let me beseech this cruel and terrible man,if maybe he will respect the feeling of his fellow-men, and havecompassion on my old age. His own father is even such another asmyself- Peleus, who bred him and reared him to- be the bane of usTrojans, and of myself more than of all others. Many a son of mine hashe slain in the flower of his youth, and yet, grieve for these as Imay, I do so for one- Hector- more than for them all, and thebitterness of my sorrow will bring me down to the house of Hades.Would that he had died in my arms, for so both his ill-starredmother who bore him, and myself, should have had the comfort ofweeping and mourning over him.""

ííííThus did he speak with many tears, and all the people of the cityjoined in his lament. Hecuba then raised the cry of wailing amongthe Trojans. ""Alas, my son,"" she cried, ""what have I left to livefor now that you are no more? Night and day did I glory in. youthroughout the city, for you were a tower of strength to all inTroy, and both men and women alike hailed you as a god. So long as youlived you were their pride, but now death and destruction havefallen upon you.""

ííííHector's wife had as yet heard nothing, for no one had come totell her that her husband had remained without the gates. She was ather loom in an inner part of the house, weaving a double purple web,and embroidering it with many flowers. She told her maids to set alarge tripod on the fire, so as to have a warm bath ready for Hectorwhen he came out of battle; poor woman, she knew not that he was nowbeyond the reach of baths, and that Minerva had laid him low by thehands of Achilles. She heard the cry coming as from the wall, andtrembled in every limb; the shuttle fell from her hands, and again shespoke to her waiting-women. ""Two of you,"" she said, ""come with me thatI may learn what it is that has befallen; I heard the voice of myhusband's honoured mother; my own heart beats as though it wouldcome into my mouth and my limbs refuse to carry me; some greatmisfortune for Priam's children must be at hand. May I never live tohear it, but I greatly fear that Achilles has cut off the retreat ofbrave Hector and has chased him on to the plain where he wassinglehanded; I fear he may have put an end to the reckless daringwhich possessed my husband, who would never remain with the body ofhis men, but would dash on far in front, foremost of them all invalour.""

ííííHer heart beat fast, and as she spoke she flew from the house like amaniac, with her waiting-women following after. When she reached thebattlements and the crowd of people, she stood looking out upon thewall, and saw Hector being borne away in front of the city- the horsesdragging him without heed or care over the ground towards the ships ofthe Achaeans. Her eyes were then shrouded as with the darkness ofnight and she fell fainting backwards. She tore the tiring from herhead and flung it from her, the frontlet and net with its plaitedband, and the veil which golden Venus had given her on the day whenHector took her with him from the house of Eetion, after havinggiven countless gifts of wooing for her sake. Her husband's sistersand the wives of his brothers crowded round her and supported her, forshe was fain to die in her distraction; when she again presentlybreathed and came to herself, she sobbed and made lament among theTrojans saying, 'Woe is me, O Hector; woe, indeed, that to share acommon lot we were born, you at Troy in the house of Priam, and I atThebes under the wooded mountain of Placus in the house of Eetionwho brought me up when I was a child- ill-starred sire of anill-starred daughter- would that he had never begotten me. You are nowgoing into the house of Hades under the secret places of the earth,and you leave me a sorrowing widow in your house. The child, of whomyou and I are the unhappy parents, is as yet a mere infant. Now thatyou are gone, O Hector, you can do nothing for him nor he for you.Even though he escape the horrors of this woful war with the Achaeans,yet shall his life henceforth be one of labour and sorrow, forothers will seize his lands. The day that robs a child of hisparents severs him from his own kind; his head is bowed, his cheeksare wet with tears, and he will go about destitute among the friendsof his father, plucking one by the cloak and another by the shirt.Some one or other of these may so far pity him as to hold the cupfor a moment towards him and let him moisten his lips, but he must notdrink enough to wet the roof of his mouth; then one whose parentsare alive will drive him from the table with blows and angry words.'Out with you,' he will say, 'you have no father here,' and thechild will go crying back to his widowed mother- he, Astyanax, whoerewhile would sit upon his father's knees, and have none but thedaintiest and choicest morsels set before him. When he had played tillhe was tired and went to sleep, he would lie in a bed, in the armsof his nurse, on a soft couch, knowing neither want nor care,whereas now that he has lost his father his lot will be full ofhardship- he, whom the Trojans name Astyanax, because you, O Hector,were the only defence of their gates and battlements. The wrigglingwrithing worms will now eat you at the ships, far from your parents,when the dogs have glutted themselves upon you. You will lie naked,although in your house you have fine and goodly raiment made byhands of women. This will I now burn; it is of no use to you, foryou can never again wear it, and thus you will have respect shownyou by the Trojans both men and women.""

ííííIn such wise did she cry aloud amid her tears, and the womenjoined in her lament.

ííííBOOK XXIII

ííííTHUS did they make their moan throughout the city, while theAchaeans when they reached the Hellespont went back every man to hisown ship. But Achilles would not let the Myrmidons go, and spoke tohis brave comrades saying, ""Myrmidons, famed horsemen and my owntrusted friends, not yet, forsooth, let us unyoke, but with horseand chariot draw near to the body and mourn Patroclus, in due honourto the dead. When we have had full comfort of lamentation we willunyoke our horses and take supper all of us here.""

ííííOn this they all joined in a cry of wailing and Achilles led them intheir lament. Thrice did they drive their chariots all sorrowing roundthe body, and Thetis stirred within them a still deeper yearning.The sands of the seashore and the men's armour were wet with theirweeping, so great a minister of fear was he whom they had lost.Chief in all their mourning was the son of Peleus: he laid hisbloodstained hand on the breast of his friend. ""Fare well,"" hecried, ""Patroclus, even in the house of Hades. I will now do allthat I erewhile promised you; I will drag Hector hither and let dogsdevour him raw; twelve noble sons of Trojans will I also slay beforeyour pyre to avenge you.""

ííííAs he spoke he treated the body of noble Hector with contumely,laying it at full length in the dust beside the bier of Patroclus. Theothers then put off every man his armour, took the horses from theirchariots, and seated themselves in great multitude by the ship ofthe fleet descendant of Aeacus, who thereon feasted them with anabundant funeral banquet. Many a goodly ox, with many a sheep andbleating goat did they butcher and cut up; many a tusked boarmoreover, fat and well-fed, did they singe and set to roast in theflames of Vulcan; and rivulets of blood flowed all round the placewhere the body was lying.

ííííThen the princes of the Achaeans took the son of Peleus toAgamemnon, but hardly could they persuade him to come with them, sowroth was he for the death of his comrade. As soon as they reachedAgamemnon's tent they told the serving-men to set a large tripodover the fire in case they might persuade the son of Peleus 'to washthe clotted gore from this body, but he denied them sternly, and sworeit with a solemn oath, saying, ""Nay, by King Jove, first and mightiestof all gods, it is not meet that water should touch my body, till Ihave laid Patroclus on the flames, have built him a barrow, and shavedmy head- for so long as I live no such second sorrow shall ever drawnigh me. Now, therefore, let us do all that this sad festival demands,but at break of day, King Agamemnon, bid your men bring wood, andprovide all else that the dead may duly take into the realm ofdarkness; the fire shall thus burn him out of our sight the sooner,and the people shall turn again to their own labours.""

ííííThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. They made hasteto prepare the meal, they ate, and every man had his full share sothat all were satisfied. As soon as they had had had enough to eat anddrink, the others went to their rest each in his own tent, but the sonof Peleus lay grieving among his Myrmidons by the shore of thesounding sea, in an open place where the waves came surging in oneafter another. Here a very deep slumber took hold upon him and easedthe burden of his sorrows, for his limbs were weary with chasingHector round windy Ilius. Presently the sad spirit of Patroclus drewnear him, like what he had been in stature, voice, and the light ofhis beaming eyes, clad, too, as he had been clad in life. The spirithovered over his head and said-

íííí""You sleep, Achilles, and have forgotten me; you loved me living,but now that I am dead you think for me no further. Bury me with allspeed that I may pass the gates of Hades; the ghosts, vain shadowsof men that can labour no more, drive me away from them; they will notyet suffer me to join those that are beyond the river, and I wanderall desolate by the wide gates of the house of Hades. Give me now yourhand I pray you, for when you have once given me my dues of fire,never shall I again come forth out of the house of Hades. Nevermoreshall we sit apart and take sweet counsel among the living; thecruel fate which was my birth-right has yawned its wide jaws aroundme- nay, you too Achilles, peer of gods, are doomed to die beneath thewall of the noble Trojans.

íííí""One prayer more will I make you, if you will grant it; let not mybones be laid apart from yours, Achilles, but with them; even as wewere brought up together in your own home, what time Menoetius broughtme to you as a child from Opoeis because by a sad spite I had killedthe son of Amphidamas- not of set purpose, but in childish quarrelover the dice. The knight Peleus took me into his house, entreatedme kindly, and named me to be your squire; therefore let our bones liein but a single urn, the two-handled golden vase given to you byyour mother.""

ííííAnd Achilles answered, ""Why, true heart, are you come hither tolay these charges upon me? will of my own self do all as you havebidden me. Draw closer to me, let us once more throw our arms aroundone another, and find sad comfort in the sharing of our sorrows.""

ííííHe opened his arms towards him as he spoke and would have claspedhim in them, but there was nothing, and the spirit vanished as avapour, gibbering and whining into the earth. Achilles sprang to hisfeet, smote his two hands, and made lamentation saying, ""Of a trutheven in the house of Hades there are ghosts and phantoms that haveno life in them; all night long the sad spirit of Patroclus hashovered over head making piteous moan, telling me what I am to dofor him, and looking wondrously like himself.""

ííííThus did he speak and his words set them all weeping and mourningabout the poor dumb dead, till rosy-fingered morn appeared. ThenKing Agamemnon sent men and mules from all parts of the camp, to bringwood, and Meriones, squire to Idomeneus, was in charge over them. Theywent out with woodmen's axes and strong ropes in their hands, andbefore them went the mules. Up hill and down dale did they go, bystraight ways and crooked, and when they reached the heights ofmany-fountained Ida, they laid their axes to the roots of many atall branching oak that came thundering down as they felled it. Theysplit the trees and bound them behind the mules, which then wendedtheir way as they best could through the thick brushwood on to theplain. All who had been cutting wood bore logs, for so Meriones squireto Idomeneus had bidden them, and they threw them down in a lineupon the seashore at the place where Achilles would make a mightymonument for Patroclus and for himself.

ííííWhen they had thrown down their great logs of wood over the wholeground, they stayed all of them where they were, but Achillesordered his brave Myrmidons to gird on their armour, and to yokeeach man his horses; they therefore rose, girded on their armour andmounted each his chariot- they and their charioteers with them. Thechariots went before, and they that were on foot followed as a cloudin their tens of thousands after. In the midst of them his comradesbore Patroclus and covered him with the locks of their hair which theycut off and threw upon his body. Last came Achilles with his headbowed for sorrow, so noble a comrade was he taking to the house ofHades.

ííííWhen they came to the place of which Achilles had told them theylaid the body down and built up the wood. Achilles then bethoughthim of another matter. He went a space away from the pyre, and cut offthe yellow lock which he had let grow for the river Spercheius. Helooked all sorrowfully out upon the dark sea, and said, ""Spercheius,in vain did my father Peleus vow to you that when I returned home tomy loved native land I should cut off this lock and offer you a holyhecatomb; fifty she-goats was I to sacrifice to you there at yoursprings, where is your grove and your altar fragrant withburnt-offerings. Thus did my father vow, but you have not fulfilledhis prayer; now, therefore, that I shall see my home no more, I givethis lock as a keepsake to the hero Patroclus.""

ííííAs he spoke he placed the lock in the hands of his dear comrade, andall who stood by were filled with yearning and lamentation. The sunwould have gone down upon their mourning had not Achilles presentlysaid to Agamemnon, ""Son of Atreus, for it is to you that the peoplewill give ear, there is a time to mourn and a time to cease frommourning; bid the people now leave the pyre and set about gettingtheir dinners: we, to whom the dead is dearest, will see to what iswanted here, and let the other princes also stay by me.""

ííííWhen King Agamemnon heard this he dismissed the people to theirships, but those who were about the dead heaped up wood and built apyre a hundred feet this way and that; then they laid the dead allsorrowfully upon the top of it. They flayed and dressed many fat sheepand oxen before the pyre, and Achilles took fat from all of them andwrapped the body therein from head to foot, heaping the flayedcarcases all round it. Against the bier he leaned two-handled jarsof honey and unguents; four proud horses did he then cast upon thepyre, groaning the while he did so. The dead hero had hadhouse-dogs; two of them did Achilles slay and threw upon the pyre;he also put twelve brave sons of noble Trojans to the sword and laidthem with the rest, for he was full of bitterness and fury. Then hecommitted all to the resistless and devouring might of the fire; hegroaned aloud and callid on his dead comrade by name. ""Fare well,""he cried, ""Patroclus, even in the house of Hades; I am now doing allthat I have promised you. Twelve brave sons of noble Trojans shall theflames consume along with yourself, but dogs, not fire, shall devourthe flesh of Hector son of Priam.""

ííííThus did he vaunt, but the dogs came not about the body of Hector,for Jove's daughter Venus kept them off him night and day, andanointed him with ambrosial oil of roses that his flesh might not betorn when Achilles was dragging him about. Phoebus Apollo moreoversent a dark cloud from heaven to earth, which gave shade to thewhole place where Hector lay, that the heat of the sun might not parchhis body.

ííííNow the pyre about dead Patroclus would not kindle. Achillestherefore bethought him of another matter; he went apart and prayed tothe two winds Boreas and Zephyrus vowing them goodly offerings. Hemade them many drink-offerings from the golden cup and besought themto come and help him that the wood might make haste to kindle andthe dead bodies be consumed. Fleet Iris heard him praying andstarted off to fetch the winds. They were holding high feast in thehouse of boisterous Zephyrus when Iris came running up to the stonethreshold of the house and stood there, but as soon as they set eyeson her they all came towards her and each of them called her to him,but Iris would not sit down. ""I cannot stay,"" she said, ""I must goback to the streams of Oceanus and the land of the Ethiopians whoare offering hecatombs to the immortals, and I would have my share;but Achilles prays that Boreas and shrill Zephyrus will come to him,and he vows them goodly offerings; he would have you blow upon thepyre of Patroclus for whom all the Achaeans are lamenting.""

ííííWith this she left them, and the two winds rose with a cry that rentthe air and swept the clouds before them. They blew on and on untilthey came to the sea, and the waves rose high beneath them, but whenthey reached Troy they fell upon the pyre till the mighty flamesroared under the blast that they blew. All night long did they blowhard and beat upon the fire, and all night long did Achilles grasp hisdouble cup, drawing wine from a mixing-bowl of gold, and callingupon the spirit of dead Patroclus as he poured it upon the grounduntil the earth was drenched. As a father mourns when he is burningthe bones of his bridegroom son whose death has wrung the hearts ofhis parents, even so did Achilles mourn while burning the body ofhis comrade, pacing round the bier with piteous groaning andlamentation.

ííííAt length as the Morning Star was beginning to herald the lightwhich saffron-mantled Dawn was soon to suffuse over the sea, theflames fell and the fire began to die. The winds then went home beyondthe Thracian sea, which roared and boiled as they swept over it. Theson of Peleus now turned away from the pyre and lay down, overcomewith toil, till he fell into a sweet slumber. Presently they whowere about the son of Atreus drew near in a body, and roused himwith the noise and tramp of their coming. He sat upright and said,""Son of Atreus, and all other princes of the Achaeans, first pourred wine everywhere upon the fire and quench it; let us then gatherthe bones of Patroclus son of Menoetius, singling them out withcare; they are easily found, for they lie in the middle of the pyre,while all else, both men and horses, has been thrown in a heap andburned at the outer edge. We will lay the bones in a golden urn, intwo layers of fat, against the time when I shall myself go down intothe house of Hades. As for the barrow, labour not to raise a great onenow, but such as is reasonable. Afterwards, let those Achaeans who maybe left at the ships when I am gone, build it both broad and high.""

ííííThus he spoke and they obeyed the word of the son of Peleus. Firstthey poured red wine upon the thick layer of ashes and quenched thefire. With many tears they singled out the whitened bones of theirloved comrade and laid them within a golden urn in two layers offat: they then covered the urn with a linen cloth and took it insidethe tent. They marked off the circle where the barrow should be,made a foundation for it about the pyre, and forthwith heaped up theearth. When they had thus raised a mound they were going away, butAchilles stayed the people and made them sit in assembly. He broughtprizes from the ships-cauldrons, tripods, horses and mules, nobleoxen, women with fair girdles, and swart iron.

ííííThe first prize he offered was for the chariot races- a womanskilled in all useful arts, and a three-legged cauldron that hadears for handles, and would hold twenty-two measures. This was for theman who came in first. For the second there was a six-year old mare,unbroken, and in foal to a he-ass; the third was to have a goodlycauldron that had never yet been on the fire; it was still bright aswhen it left the maker, and would hold four measures. The fourth prizewas two talents of gold, and the fifth a two-handled urn as yetunsoiled by smoke. Then he stood up and spoke among the Argivessaying-

íííí""Son of Atreus, and all other Achaeans, these are the prizes thatlie waiting the winners of the chariot races. At any other time Ishould carry off the first prize and take it to my own tent; youknow how far my steeds excel all others- for they are immortal;Neptune gave them to my father Peleus, who in his turn gave them tomyself; but I shall hold aloof, I and my steeds that have lost theirbrave and kind driver, who many a time has washed them in clearwater and anointed their manes with oil. See how they stand weepinghere, with their manes trailing on the ground in the extremity oftheir sorrow. But do you others set yourselves in order throughout thehost, whosoever has confidence in his horses and in the strength ofhis chariot.""

ííííThus spoke the son of Peleus and the drivers of chariots bestirredthemselves. First among them all uprose Eumelus, king of men, son ofAdmetus, a man excellent in horsemanship. Next to him rose mightyDiomed son of Tydeus; he yoked the Trojan horses which he had takenfrom Aeneas, when Apollo bore him out of the fight. Next to him,yellow-haired Menelaus son of Atreus rose and yoked his fleethorses, Agamemnon's mare Aethe, and his own horse Podargus. The marehad been given to Agamemnon by echepolus son of Anchises, that hemight not have to follow him to Ilius, but might stay at home and takehis ease; for Jove had endowed him with great wealth and he lived inspacious Sicyon. This mare, all eager for the race, did Menelaus putunder the yoke.

ííííFourth in order Antilochus, son to noble Nestor son of Neleus,made ready his horses. These were bred in Pylos, and his father cameup to him to give him good advice of which, however, he stood in butlittle need. ""Antilochus,"" said Nestor, ""you are young, but Jove andNeptune have loved you well, and have made you an excellenthorseman. I need not therefore say much by way of instruction. You areskilful at wheeling your horses round the post, but the horsesthemselves are very slow, and it is this that will, I fear, mar yourchances. The other drivers know less than you do, but their horses arefleeter; therefore, my dear son, see if you cannot hit upon someartifice whereby you may insure that the prize shall not slipthrough your fingers. The woodman does more by skill than by bruteforce; by skill the pilot guides his storm-tossed barque over the sea,and so by skill one driver can beat another. If a man go wide inrounding this way and that, whereas a man who knows what he is doingmay have worse horses, but he will keep them well in hand when he seesthe doubling-post; he knows the precise moment at which to pull therein, and keeps his eye well on the man in front of him. I will giveyou this certain token which cannot escape your notice. There is astump of a dead tree-oak or pine as it may be- some six feet above theground, and not yet rotted away by rain; it stands at the fork ofthe road; it has two white stones set one on each side, and there is aclear course all round it. It may have been a monument to some onelong since dead, or it may have been used as a doubling-post in daysgone by; now, however, it has been fixed on by Achilles as the markround which the chariots shall turn; hug it as close as you can, butas you stand in your chariot lean over a little to the left; urge onyour right-hand horse with voice and lash, and give him a looserein, but let the left-hand horse keep so close in, that the nave ofyour wheel shall almost graze the post; but mind the stone, or youwill wound your horses and break your chariot in pieces, which wouldbe sport for others but confusion for yourself. Therefore, my dearson, mind well what you are about, for if you can be first to roundthe post there is no chance of any one giving you the goby later,not even though you had Adrestus's horse Arion behind you horsewhich is of divine race- or those of Laomedon, which are the noblestin this country.""

ííííWhen Nestor had made an end of counselling his son he sat down inhis place, and fifth in order Meriones got ready his horses. They thenall mounted their chariots and cast lots.- Achilles shook thehelmet, and the lot of Antilochus son of Nestor fell out first; nextcame that of King Eumelus, and after his, those of Menelaus son ofAtreus and of Meriones. The last place fell to the lot of Diomed sonof Tydeus, who was the best man of them all. They took their places inline; Achilles showed them the doubling-post round which they wereto turn, some way off upon the plain; here he stationed his father'sfollower Phoenix as umpire, to note the running, and report truly.

ííííAt the same instant they all of them lashed their horses, struckthem with the reins, and shouted at them with all their might. Theyflew full speed over the plain away from the ships, the dust rose fromunder them as it were a cloud or whirlwind, and their manes were allflying in the wind. At one moment the chariots seemed to touch theground, and then again they bounded into the air; the drivers stooderect, and their hearts beat fast and furious in their lust ofvictory. Each kept calling on his horses, and the horses scoured theplain amid the clouds of dust that they raised.

ííííIt was when they were doing the last part of the course on their wayback towards the sea that their pace was strained to the utmost and itwas seen what each could do. The horses of the descendant of Pheresnow took the lead, and close behind them came the Trojan stallionsof Diomed. They seemed as if about to mount Eumelus's chariot, andhe could feel their warm breath on his back and on his broadshoulders, for their heads were close to him as they flew over thecourse. Diomed would have now passed him, or there would have been adead heat, but Phoebus Apollo to spite him made him drop his whip.Tears of anger fell from his eyes as he saw the mares going onfaster than ever, while his own horses lost ground through hishaving no whip. Minerva saw the trick which Apollo had played theson of Tydeus, so she brought him his whip and put spirit into hishorses; moreover she went after the son of Admetus in a rage and brokehis yoke for him; the mares went one to one side the course, and theother to the other, and the pole was broken against the ground.Eumelus was thrown from his chariot close to the wheel; his elbows,mouth, and nostrils were all torn, and his forehead was bruisedabove his eyebrows; his eyes filled with tears and he could find noutterance. But the son of Tydeus turned his horses aside and shotfar ahead, for Minerva put fresh strength into them and covered Diomedhimself with glory.

ííííMenelaus son of Atreus came next behind him, but Antilochus calledto his father's horses. ""On with you both,"" he cried, ""and do yourvery utmost. I do not bid you try to beat the steeds of the son ofTydeus, for Minerva has put running into them, and has coveredDiomed with glory; but you must overtake the horses of the son ofAtreus and not be left behind, or Aethe who is so fleet will tauntyou. Why, my good fellows, are you lagging? I tell you, and it shallsurely be- Nestor will keep neither of you, but will put both of youto the sword, if we win any the worse a prize through yourcarelessness, fly after them at your utmost speed; I will hit on aplan for passing them in a narrow part of the way, and it shall notfail me.""

ííííThey feared the rebuke of their master, and for a short space wentquicker. Presently Antilochus saw a narrow place where the road hadsunk. The ground was broken, for the winter's rain had gathered andhad worn the road so that the whole place was deepened. Menelaus wasmaking towards it so as to get there first, for fear of a foul, butAntilochus turned his horses out of the way, and followed him a littleon one side. The son of Atreus was afraid and shouted out,""Antilochus, you are driving recklessly; rein in your horses; the roadis too narrow here, it will be wider soon, and you can pass me then;if you foul my chariot you may bring both of us to a mischief.""

ííííBut Antilochus plied his whip, and drove faster, as though he hadnot heard him. They went side by side for about as far as a youngman can hurl a disc from his shoulder when he is trying hisstrength, and then Menelaus's mares drew behind, for he left offdriving for fear the horses should foul one another and upset thechariots; thus, while pressing on in quest of victory, they might bothcome headlong to the ground. Menelaus then upbraided Antilochus andsaid, ""There is no greater trickster living than you are; go, andbad luck go with you; the Achaeans say not well that you haveunderstanding, and come what may you shall not bear away the prizewithout sworn protest on my part.""

ííííThen he called on his horses and said to them, ""Keep your pace,and slacken not; the limbs of the other horses will weary soonerthan yours, for they are neither of them young.""

ííííThe horses feared the rebuke of their master, and went faster, sothat they were soon nearly up with the others.

ííííMeanwhile the Achaeans from their seats were watching how the horseswent, as they scoured the plain amid clouds of their own dust.Idomeneus captain of the Cretans was first to make out the running,for he was not in the thick of the crowd, but stood on the mostcommanding part of the ground. The driver was a long way off, butIdomeneus could hear him shouting, and could see the foremost horsequite plainly- a chestnut with a round white star, like the moon, onits forehead. He stood up and said among the Argives, ""My friends,princes and counsellors of the Argives, can you see the running aswell as I can? There seems to be another pair in front now, andanother driver; those that led off at the start must have beendisabled out on the plain. I saw them at first making their wayround the doubling-post, but now, though I search the plain of Troy, Icannot find them. Perhaps the reins fell from the driver's hand sothat he lost command of his horses at the doubling-post, and could notturn it. I suppose he must have been thrown out there, and brokenhis chariot, while his mares have left the course and gone offwildly in a panic. Come up and see for yourselves, I cannot make outfor certain, but the driver seems an Aetolian by descent, ruler overthe Argives, brave Diomed the son of Tydeus.""

ííííAjax the son of Oileus took him up rudely and said, ""Idomeneus,why should you be in such a hurry to tell us all about it, when themares are still so far out upon the plain? You are none of theyoungest, nor your eyes none of the sharpest, but you are alwayslaying down the law. You have no right to do so, for there arebetter men here than you are. Eumelus's horses are in front now, asthey always have been, and he is on the chariot holding the reins.""

ííííThe captain of the Cretans was angry, and answered, ""Ajax you are anexcellent railer, but you have no judgement, and are wanting in muchelse as well, for you have a vile temper. I will wager you a tripod orcauldron, and Agamemnon son of Atreus shall decide whose horses arefirst. You will then know to your cost.""

ííííAjax son of Oileus was for making him an angry answer, and therewould have been yet further brawling between them, had not Achillesrisen in his place and said, ""Cease your railing Ajax and Idomeneus;it is not you would be scandalised if you saw any one else do thelike: sit down and keep your eyes on the horses; they are speedingtowards the winning-post and will be bere directly. You will then bothof you know whose horses are first, and whose come after.""

ííííAs he was speaking, the son of Tydeus came driving in, plying hiswhip lustily from his shoulder, and his horses stepping high as theyflew over the course. The sand and grit rained thick on the driver,and the chariot inlaid with gold and tin ran close behind his fleethorses. There was little trace of wheel-marks in the fine dust, andthe horses came flying in at their utmost speed. Diomed stayed them inthe middle of the crowd, and the sweat from their manes and chestsfell in streams on to the ground. Forthwith he sprang from hisgoodly chariot, and leaned his whip against his horses' yoke; braveSthenelus now lost no time, but at once brought on the prize, and gavethe woman and the ear-handled cauldron to his comrades to take away.Then he unyoked the horses.

ííííNext after him came in Antilochus of the race of Neleus, who hadpassed Menelaus by a trick and not by the fleetness of his horses; buteven so Menelaus came in as close behind him as the wheel is to thehorse that draws both the chariot and its master. The end hairs of ahorse's tail touch the tyre of the wheel, and there is never muchspace between wheel and horse when the chariot is going; Menelauswas no further than this behind Antilochus, though at first he hadbeen a full disc's throw behind him. He had soon caught him upagain, for Agamemnon's mare Aethe kept pulling stronger andstronger, so that if the course had been longer he would have passedhim, and there would not even have been a dead heat. Idomeneus's bravesquire Meriones was about a spear's cast behind Menelaus. His horseswere slowest of all, and he was the worst driver. Last of them allcame the son of Admetus, dragging his chariot and driving his horseson in front. When Achilles saw him he was sorry, and stood up amongthe Argives saying, ""The best man is coming in last. Let us give him aprize for it is reasonable. He shall have the second, but the firstmust go to the son of Tydeus.""

ííííThus did he speak and the others all of them applauded his saying,and were for doing as he had said, but Nestor's son Antilochus stoodup and claimed his rights from the son of Peleus. ""Achilles,"" said he,""I shall take it much amiss if you do this thing; you would rob meof my prize, because you think Eumelus's chariot and horses werethrown out, and himself too, good man that he is. He should haveprayed duly to the immortals; he would not have come in fast if he haddone so. If you are sorry for him and so choose, you have much gold inyour tents, with bronze, sheep, cattle and horses. Take something fromthis store if you would have the Achaeans speak well of you, andgive him a better prize even than that which you have now offered; butI will not give up the mare, and he that will fight me for her, lethim come on.""

ííííAchilles smiled as he heard this, and was pleased with Antilochus,who was one of his dearest comrades. So he said-

íííí""Antilochus, if you would have me find Eumelus another prize, I willgive him the bronze breastplate with a rim of tin running all round itwhich I took from Asteropaeus. It will be worth much money to him.""

ííííHe bade his comrade Automedon bring the breastplate from his tent,and he did so. Achilles then gave it over to Eumelus, who receivedit gladly.

ííííBut Menelaus got up in a rage, furiously angry with Antilochus. Anattendant placed his staff in his hands and bade the Argives keepsilence: the hero then addressed them. ""Antilochus,"" said he, ""what isthis from you who have been so far blameless? You have made me cut apoor figure and baulked my horses by flinging your own in front ofthem, though yours are much worse than mine are; therefore, Oprinces and counsellors of the Argives, judge between us and show nofavour, lest one of the Achaeans say, 'Menelaus has got the marethrough lying and corruption; his horses were far inferior toAntilochus's, but he has greater weight and influence.' Nay, I willdetermine the matter myself, and no man will blame me, for I shalldo what is just. Come here, Antilochus, and stand, as our custom is,whip in hand before your chariot and horses; lay your hand on yoursteeds, and swear by earth-encircling Neptune that you did notpurposely and guilefully get in the way of my horses.""

ííííAnd Antilochus answered, ""Forgive me; I am much younger, KingMenelaus, than you are; you stand higher than I do and are thebetter man of the two; you know how easily young men are betrayed intoindiscretion; their tempers are more hasty and they have lessjudgement; make due allowances therefore, and bear with me; I willof my own accord give up the mare that I have won, and if you claimany further chattel from my own possessions, I would rather yield itto you, at once, than fall from your good graces henceforth, and dowrong in the sight of heaven.""

ííííThe son of Nestor then took the mare and gave her over toMenelaus, whose anger was thus appeased; as when dew falls upon afield of ripening corn, and the lands are bristling with theharvest- even so, O Menelaus, was your heart made glad within you.He turned to Antilochus and said, ""Now, Antilochus, angry though Ihave been, I can give way to you of my own free will; you have neverbeen headstrong nor ill-disposed hitherto, but this time your youthhas got the better of your judgement; be careful how you outwit yourbetters in future; no one else could have brought me round soeasily, but your good father, your brother, and yourself have all ofyou had infinite trouble on my behalf; I therefore yield to yourentreaty, and will give up the mare to you, mine though it indeedbe; the people will thus see that I am neither harsh nor vindictive.""

ííííWith this he gave the mare over to Antilochus's comrade Noemon,and then took the cauldron. Meriones, who had come in fourth,carried off the two talents of gold, and the fifth prize, thetwo-handled urn, being unawarded, Achilles gave it to Nestor, going upto him among the assembled Argives and saying, ""Take this, my good oldfriend, as an heirloom and memorial of the funeral of Patroclus- foryou shall see him no more among the Argives. I give you this prizethough you cannot win one; you can now neither wrestle nor fight,and cannot enter for the javelin-match nor foot-races, for the hand ofage has been laid heavily upon you.""

ííííSo saying he gave the urn over to Nestor, who received it gladly andanswered, ""My son, all that you have said is true; there is nostrength now in my legs and feet, nor can I hit out with my hands fromeither shoulder. Would that I were still young and strong as whenthe Epeans were burying King Amarynceus in Buprasium, and his sonsoffered prizes in his honour. There was then none that could viewith me neither of the Epeans nor the Pylians themselves nor theAetolians. In boxing I overcame Clytomedes son of Enops, and inwrestling, Ancaeus of Pleuron who had come forward against me.Iphiclus was a good runner, but I beat him, and threw farther withmy spear than either Phyleus or Polydorus. In chariot-racing alone didthe two sons of Actor surpass me by crowding their horses in frontof me, for they were angry at the way victory had gone, and at thegreater part of the prizes remaining in the place in which they hadbeen offered. They were twins, and the one kept on holding thereins, and holding the reins, while the other plied the whip. Such wasI then, but now I must leave these matters to younger men; I mustbow before the weight of years, but in those days I was eminentamong heroes. And now, sir, go on with the funeral contests inhonour of your comrade: gladly do I accept this urn, and my heartrejoices that you do not forget me but are ever mindful of my goodwilltowards you, and of the respect due to me from the Achaeans. For allwhich may the grace of heaven be vouchsafed you in great abundance.""

ííííThereon the son of Peleus, when he had listened to all the thanks ofNestor, went about among the concourse of the Achaeans, andpresently offered prizes for skill in the painful art of boxing. Hebrought out a strong mule, and made it fast in the middle of thecrowd- a she-mule never yet broken, but six years old-  when it ishardest of all to break them: this was for the victor, and for thevanquished he offered a double cup. Then he stood up and said amongthe Argives, ""Son of Atreus, and all other Achaeans, I invite ourtwo champion boxers to lay about them lustily and compete for theseprizes. He to whom Apollo vouchsafes the greater endurance, and whomthe Achaeans acknowledge as victor, shall take the mule back withhim to his own tent, while he that is vanquished shall have the doublecup.""

ííííAs he spoke there stood up a champion both brave and greatstature, a skilful boxer, Epeus, son of Panopeus. He laid his handon the mule and said, ""Let the man who is to have the cup come hither,for none but myself will take the mule. I am the best boxer of allhere present, and none can beat me. Is it not enough that I shouldfall short of you in actual fighting? Still, no man can be good ateverything. I tell you plainly, and it shall come true; if any manwill box with me I will bruise his body and break his bones; thereforelet his friends stay here in a body and be at hand to take him awaywhen I have done with him.""

ííííThey all held their peace, and no man rose save Euryalus son ofMecisteus, who was son of Talaus. Mecisteus went once to Thebesafter the fall of Oedipus, to attend his funeral, and he beat allthe people of Cadmus. The son of Tydeus was Euryalus's second,cheering him on and hoping heartily that he would win. First he puta waistband round him and then he gave him some well-cut thongs ofox-hide; the two men being now girt went into the middle of thering, and immediately fell to; heavily indeed did they punish oneanother and lay about them with their brawny fists. One could hear thehorrid crashing of their jaws, and they sweated from every pore oftheir skin. Presently Epeus came on and gave Euryalus a blow on thejaw as he was looking round; Euryalus could not keep his legs; theygave way under him in a moment and he sprang up with a bound, as afish leaps into the air near some shore that is all bestrewn withsea-wrack, when Boreas furs the top of the waves, and then fallsback into deep water. But noble Epeus caught hold of him and raisedhim up; his comrades also came round him and led him from the ring,unsteady in his gait, his head hanging on one side, and spitting greatclots of gore. They set him down in a swoon and then went to fetch thedouble cup.

ííííThe son of Peleus now brought out the prizes for the third contestand showed them to the Argives. These were for the painful art ofwrestling. For the winner there was a great tripod ready for settingupon the fire, and the Achaeans valued it among themselves at twelveoxen. For the loser he brought out a woman skilled in all manner ofarts, and they valued her at four oxen. He rose and said among theArgives, ""Stand forward, you who will essay this contest.""

ííííForthwith uprose great Ajax the son of Telamon, and craftyUlysses, full of wiles rose also. The two girded themselves and wentinto the middle of the ring. They gripped each other in their stronghands like the rafters which some master-builder frames for the roofof a high house to keep the wind out. Their backbones cracked asthey tugged at one another with their mighty arms- and sweat rainedfrom them in torrents. Many a bloody weal sprang up on their sides andshoulders, but they kept on striving with might and main for victoryand to win the tripod. Ulysses could not throw Ajax, nor Ajax him;Ulysses was too strong for him; but when the Achaeans began to tire ofwatching them, Ajax said to ulysses, ""Ulysses, noble son of Laertes,you shall either lift me, or I you, and let Jove settle it betweenus.""

ííííHe lifted him from the ground as he spoke, but Ulysses did notforget his cunning. He hit Ajax in the hollow at back of his knee,so that he could not keep his feet, but fell on his back withUlysses lying upon his chest, and all who saw it marvelled. ThenUlysses in turn lifted Ajax and stirred him a little from the groundbut could not lift him right off it, his knee sank under him, andthe two fell side by side on the ground and were all begrimed withdust. They now sprang towards one another and were for wrestling yet athird time, but Achilles rose and stayed them. ""Put not each otherfurther,"" said he, ""to such cruel suffering; the victory is withboth alike, take each of you an equal prize, and let the otherAchaeans now compete.""

ííííThus did he speak and they did even as he had said, and put on theirshirts again after wiping the dust from off their bodies.

ííííThe son of Peleus then offered prizes for speed in running- amixing-bowl beautifully wrought, of pure silver. It would hold sixmeasures, and far exceeded all others in the whole world for beauty;it was the work of cunning artificers in Sidon, and had been broughtinto port by Phoenicians from beyond the sea, who had made a presentof it to Thoas. Eueneus son of jason had given it to Patroclus inransom of Priam's son Lycaon, and Achilles now offered it as a prizein honour of his comrade to him who should be the swiftest runner. Forthe second prize he offered a large ox, well fattened, while for thelast there was to be half a talent of gold. He then rose and saidamong the Argives, ""Stand forward, you who will essay this contest.""

ííííForthwith uprose fleet Ajax son of Oileus, with cunning Ulysses, andNestor's son Antilochus, the fastest runner among all the youth of histime. They stood side by side and Achilles showed them the goal. Thecourse was set out for them from the starting-post, and the son ofOileus took the lead at once, with Ulysses as close behind him asthe shuttle is to a woman's bosom when she throws the woof acrossthe warp and holds it close up to her; even so close behind him wasUlysses- treading in his footprints before the dust could settlethere, and Ajax could feel his breath on the back of his head as heran swiftly on. The Achaeans all shouted applause as they saw himstraining his utmost, and cheered him as he shot past them; but whenthey were now nearing the end of the course Ulysses prayed inwardly toMinerva. ""Hear me,"" he cried, ""and help my feet, O goddess."" Thusdid he pray, and Pallas Minerva heard his prayer; she made his handsand his feet feel light, and when the runners were at the point ofpouncing upon the prize, Ajax, through Minerva's spite slipped uponsome offal that was lying there from the cattle which Achilles hadslaughtered in honour of Patroclus, and his mouth and nostrils wereall filled with cow dung. Ulysses therefore carried off themixing-bowl, for he got before Ajax and came in first. But Ajax tookthe ox and stood with his hand on one of its horns, spitting thedung out of his mouth. Then he said to the Argives, ""Alas, the goddesshas spoiled my running; she watches over Ulysses and stands by himas though she were his own mother."" Thus did he speak and they allof them laughed heartily.

ííííAntilochus carried off the last prize and smiled as he said to thebystanders, ""You all see, my friends, that now too the gods have showntheir respect for seniority. Ajax is somewhat older than I am, andas for Ulysses, he belongs to an earlier generation, but he is hale inspite of his years, and no man of the Achaeans can run against himsave only Achilles.""

ííííHe said this to pay a compliment to the son of Peleus, andAchilles answered, ""Antilochus, you shall not have praised me to nopurpose; I shall give you an additional half talent of gold."" Hethen gave the half talent to Antilochus, who received it gladly.

ííííThen the son of Peleus brought out the spear, helmet and shield thathad been borne by Sarpedon, and were taken from him by Patroclus. Hestood up and said among the Argives, ""We bid two champions put ontheir armour, take their keen blades, and make trial of one another inthe presence of the multitude; whichever of them can first wound theflesh of the other, cut through his armour, and draw blood, to himwill I give this goodly Thracian sword inlaid with silver, which Itook from Asteropaeus, but the armour let both hold in partnership,and I will give each of them a hearty meal in my own tent.""

ííííForthwith uprose great Ajax the son of Telamon, as also mightyDiomed son of Tydeus. When they had put on their armour each on hisown side of the ring, they both went into the middle eager toengage, and with fire flashing from their eyes. The Achaeans marvelledas they beheld them, and when the two were now close up with oneanother, thrice did they spring forward and thrice try to strikeeach other in close combat. Ajax pierced Diomed's round shield, butdid not draw blood, for the cuirass beneath the shield protectedhim; thereon the son of Tydeus from over his huge shield kept aimingcontinually at Ajax's neck with the point of his spear, and theAchaeans alarmed for his safety bade them leave off fighting anddivide the prize between them. Achilles then gave the great sword tothe son of Tydeus, with its scabbard, and the leathern belt with whichto hang it.

ííííAchilles next offered the massive iron quoit which mighty Eetion haderewhile been used to hurl, until Achilles had slain him and carriedit off in his ships along with other spoils. He stood up and saidamong the Argives, ""Stand forward, you who would essay this contest.He who wins it will have a store of iron that will last him five yearsas they go rolling round, and if his fair fields lie far from a townhis shepherd or ploughman will not have to make a journey to buy iron,for he will have a stock of it on his own premises.""

ííííThen uprose the two mighty men Polypoetes and Leonteus, with Ajaxson of Telamon and noble Epeus. They stood up one after the otherand Epeus took the quoit, whirled it, and flung it from him, which setall the Achaeans laughing. After him threw Leonteus of the race ofMars. Ajax son of Telamon threw third, and sent the quoit beyond anymark that had been made yet, but when mighty Polypoetes took the quoithe hurled it as though it had been a stockman's stick which he sendsflying about among his cattle when he is driving them, so far didhis throw out-distance those of the others. All who saw it roaredapplause, and his comrades carried the prize for him and set it onboard his ship.

ííííAchilles next offered a prize of iron for archery- tendouble-edged axes and ten with single eddies: he set up a ship's mast,some way off upon the sands, and with a fine string tied a pigeon toit by the foot; this was what they were to aim at. ""Whoever,"" he said,""can hit the pigeon shall have all the axes and take them away withhim; he who hits the string without hitting the bird will have taken aworse aim and shall have the single-edged axes.""

ííííThen uprose King Teucer, and Meriones the stalwart squire ofIdomeneus rose also, They cast lots in a bronze helmet and the lotof Teucer fell first. He let fly with his arrow forthwith, but hedid not promise hecatombs of firstling lambs to King Apollo, andmissed his bird, for Apollo foiled his aim; but he hit the string withwhich the bird was tied, near its foot; the arrow cut the string cleanthrough so that it hung down towards the ground, while the bird flewup into the sky, and the Achaeans shouted applause. Meriones, whohad his arrow ready while Teucer was aiming, snatched the bow out ofhis hand, and at once promised that he would sacrifice a hecatomb offirstling lambs to Apollo lord of the bow; then espying the pigeonhigh up under the clouds, he hit her in the middle of the wing asshe was circling upwards; the arrow went clean through the wing andfixed itself in the ground at Meriones' feet, but the bird perchedon the ship's mast hanging her head and with all her feathersdrooping; the life went out of her, and she fell heavily from themast. Meriones, therefore, took all ten double-edged axes, whileTeucer bore off the single-edged ones to his ships.

ííííThen the son of Peleus brought in a spear and a cauldron that hadnever been on the fire; it was worth an ox, and was chased with apattern of flowers; and those that throw the javelin stood up- towit the son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, and Meriones, stalwartsquire of Idomeneus. But Achilles spoke saying, ""Son of Atreus, weknow how far you excel all others both in power and in throwing thejavelin; take the cauldron back with you to your ships, but if it soplease you, let us give the spear to Meriones; this at least is what Ishould myself wish.""

ííííKing Agamemnon assented. So he gave the bronze spear to Meriones,and handed the goodly cauldron to Talthybius his esquire.

ííííBOOK XXIV

ííííTHE assembly now broke up and the people went their ways each to hisown ship. There they made ready their supper, and then bethoughtthem of the blessed boon of sleep; but Achilles still wept forthinking of his dear comrade, and sleep, before whom all things bow,could take no hold upon him. This way and that did he turn as heyearned after the might and manfulness of Patroclus; he thought of allthey had done together, and all they had gone through both on thefield of battle and on the waves of the weary sea. As he dwelt onthese things he wept bitterly and lay now on his side, now on hisback, and now face downwards, till at last he rose and went out as onedistraught to wander upon the seashore. Then, when he saw dawnbreaking over beach and sea, he yoked his horses to his chariot, andbound the body of Hector behind it that he might drag it about. Thricedid he drag it round the tomb of the son of Menoetius, and then wentback into his tent, leaving the body on the ground full length andwith its face downwards. But Apollo would not suffer it to bedisfigured, for he pitied the man, dead though he now was; thereforehe shielded him with his golden aegis continually, that he mighttake no hurt while Achilles was dragging him.

ííííThus shamefully did Achilles in his fury dishonour Hector; but theblessed gods looked down in pity from heaven, and urged Mercury,slayer of Argus, to steal the body. All were of this mind save onlyJuno, Neptune, and Jove's grey-eyed daughter, who persisted in thehate which they had ever borne towards Ilius with Priam and hispeople; for they forgave not the wrong done them by Alexandrus indisdaining the goddesses who came to him when he was in hissheepyards, and preferring her who had offered him a wanton to hisruin.

ííííWhen, therefore, the morning of the twelfth day had now come,Phoebus Apollo spoke among the immortals saying, ""You gods ought to beashamed of yourselves; you are cruel and hard-hearted. Did notHector burn you thigh-bones of heifers and of unblemished goats? Andnow dare you not rescue even his dead body, for his wife to look upon,with his mother and child, his father Priam, and his people, who wouldforthwith commit him to the flames, and give him his due funeralrites? So, then, you would all be on the side of mad Achilles, whoknows neither right nor ruth? He is like some savage lion that inthe pride of his great strength and daring springs upon men's flocksand gorges on them. Even so has Achilles flung aside all pity, and allthat conscience which at once so greatly banes yet greatly boons himthat will heed it. man may lose one far dearer than Achilles has lost-a son, it may be, or a brother born from his own mother's womb; yetwhen he has mourned him and wept over him he will let him bide, for ittakes much sorrow to kill a man; whereas Achilles, now that he hasslain noble Hector, drags him behind his chariot round the tomb of hiscomrade. It were better of him, and for him, that he should not do so,for brave though he be we gods may take it ill that he should vent hisfury upon dead clay.""

ííííJuno spoke up in a rage. ""This were well,"" she cried, ""O lord of thesilver bow, if you would give like honour to Hector and to Achilles;but Hector was mortal and suckled at a woman's breast, whereasAchilles is the offspring of a goddess whom I myself reared andbrought up. I married her to Peleus, who is above measure dear tothe immortals; you gods came all of you to her wedding; you feastedalong with them yourself and brought your lyre- false, and fond of lowcompany, that you have ever been.""

ííííThen said Jove, ""Juno, be not so bitter. Their honour shall not beequal, but of all that dwell in Ilius, Hector was dearest to the gods,as also to myself, for his offerings never failed me. Never was myaltar stinted of its dues, nor of the drink-offerings and savour ofsacrifice which we claim of right. I shall therefore permit the bodyof mighty Hector to be stolen; and yet this may hardly be withoutAchilles coming to know it, for his mother keeps night and daybeside him. Let some one of you, therefore, send Thetis to me, and Iwill impart my counsel to her, namely that Achilles is to accept aransom from Priam, and give up the body.""

ííííOn this Iris fleet as the wind went forth to carry his message. Downshe plunged into the dark sea midway between Samos and rocky Imbrus;the waters hissed as they closed over her, and she sank into thebottom as the lead at the end of an ox-horn, that is sped to carrydeath to fishes. She found Thetis sitting in a great cave with theother sea-goddesses gathered round her; there she sat in the midstof them weeping for her noble son who was to fall far from his ownland, on the rich plains of Troy. Iris went up to her and said,""Rise Thetis; Jove, whose counsels fail not, bids you come to him.""And Thetis answered, ""Why does the mighty god so bid me? I am in greatgrief, and shrink from going in and out among the immortals. Still,I will go, and the word that he may speak shall not be spoken invain.""

ííííThe goddess took her dark veil, than which there can be no robe moresombre, and went forth with fleet Iris leading the way before her. Thewaves of the sea opened them a path, and when they reached the shorethey flew up into the heavens, where they found the all-seeing sonof Saturn with the blessed gods that live for ever assembled near him.Minerva gave up her seat to her, and she sat down by the side offather Jove. Juno then placed a fair golden cup in her hand, and spoketo her in words of comfort, whereon Thetis drank and gave her back thecup; and the sire of gods and men was the first to speak.

íííí""So, goddess,"" said he, ""for all your sorrow, and the grief that Iwell know reigns ever in your heart, you have come hither toOlympus, and I will tell you why I have sent for you. This nine dayspast the immortals have been quarrelling about Achilles waster ofcities and the body of Hector. The gods would have Mercury slayer ofArgus steal the body, but in furtherance of our peace and amityhenceforward, I will concede such honour to your son as I will nowtell you. Go, then, to the host and lay these commands upon him; saythat the gods are angry with him, and that I am myself more angry thanthem all, in that he keeps Hector at the ships and will not give himup. He may thus fear me and let the body go. At the same time I willsend Iris to great Priam to bid him go to the ships of the Achaeans,and ransom his son, taking with him such gifts for Achilles as maygive him satisfaction.

ííííSilver-footed Thetis did as the god had told her, and forthwith downshe darted from the topmost summits of Olympus. She went to herson's tents where she found him grieving bitterly, while his trustycomrades round him were busy preparing their morning meal, for whichthey had killed a great woolly sheep. His mother sat down beside himand caressed him with her hand saying, ""My son, how long will you keepon thus grieving and making moan? You are gnawing at your own heart,and think neither of food nor of woman's embraces; and yet these toowere well, for you have no long time to live, and death with thestrong hand of fate are already close beside you. Now, therefore, heedwhat I say, for I come as a messenger from Jove; he says that the godsare angry with you, and himself more angry than them all, in thatyou keep Hector at the ships and will not give him up. Therefore lethim go, and accept a ransom for his body.""

ííííAnd Achilles answered, ""So be it. If Olympian Jove of his own motionthus commands me, let him that brings the ransom bear the body away.""

ííííThus did mother and son talk together at the ships in long discoursewith one another. Meanwhile the son of Saturn sent Iris to thestrong city of Ilius. ""Go,"" said he, ""fleet Iris, from the mansions ofOlympus, and tell King Priam in Ilius, that he is to go to the shipsof the Achaeans and free the body of his dear son. He is to takesuch gifts with him as shall give satisfaction to Achilles, and heis to go alone, with no other Trojan, save only some honouredservant who may drive his mules and waggon, and bring back the body ofhim whom noble Achilles has slain. Let him have no thought nor fear ofdeath in his heart, for we will send the slayer of Argus to escorthim, and bring him within the tent of Achilles. Achilles will not killhim nor let another do so, for he will take heed to his ways and sinnot, and he will entreat a suppliant with all honourable courtesy.""

ííííOn this Iris, fleet as the wind, sped forth to deliver hermessage. She went to Priam's house, and found weeping andlamentation therein. His sons were seated round their father in theouter courtyard, and their raiment was wet with tears: the old man satin the midst of them with his mantle wrapped close about his body, andhis head and neck all covered with the filth which he had clutchedas he lay grovelling in the mire. His daughters and his sons' wiveswent wailing about the house, as they thought of the many and bravemen who lay dead, slain by the Argives. The messenger of Jove stood byPriam and spoke softly to him, but fear fell upon him as she did so.""Take heart,"" she said, ""Priam offspring of Dardanus, take heart andfear not. I bring no evil tidings, but am minded well towards you. Icome as a messenger from Jove, who though he be not near, takesthought for you and pities you. The lord of Olympus bids you go andransom noble Hector, and take with you such gifts as shall givesatisfaction to Achilles. You are to go alone, with no Trojan, saveonly some honoured servant who may drive your mules and waggon, andbring back to the city the body of him whom noble Achilles hasslain. You are to have no thought, nor fear of death, for Jove willsend the slayer of Argus to escort you. When he has brought you withinAchilles' tent, Achilles will not kill you nor let another do so,for he will take heed to his ways and sin not, and he will entreat asuppliant with all honourable courtesy.""

ííííIris went her way when she had thus spoken, and Priam told hissons to get a mule-waggon ready, and to make the body of the waggonfast upon the top of its bed. Then he went down into his fragrantstore-room, high-vaulted, and made of cedar-wood, where his manytreasures were kept, and he called Hecuba his wife. ""Wife,"" said he,""a messenger has come to me from Olympus, and has told me to go to theships of the Achaeans to ransom my dear son, taking with me such giftsas shall give satisfaction to Achilles. What think you of this matter?for my own part I am greatly moved to pass through the of the Achaeansand go to their ships.""

ííííHis wife cried aloud as she heard him, and said, ""Alas, what hasbecome of that judgement for which you have been ever famous bothamong strangers and your own people? How can you venture alone tothe ships of the Achaeans, and look into the face of him who has slainso many of your brave sons? You must have iron courage, for if thecruel savage sees you and lays hold on you, he will know neitherrespect nor pity. Let us then weep Hector from afar here in our ownhouse, for when I gave him birth the threads of overruling fate werespun for him that dogs should eat his flesh far from his parents, inthe house of that terrible man on whose liver I would fain fastenand devour it. Thus would I avenge my son, who showed no cowardicewhen Achilles slew him, and thought neither of Right nor of avoidingbattle as he stood in defence of Trojan men and Trojan women.""

ííííThen Priam said, ""I would go, do not therefore stay me nor be as abird of ill omen in my house, for you will not move me. Had it beensome mortal man who had sent me some prophet or priest who divinesfrom sacrifice- I should have deemed him false and have given him noheed; but now I have heard the goddess and seen her face to face,therefore I will go and her saying shall not be in vain. If it be myfate to die at the ships of the Achaeans even so would I have it;let Achilles slay me, if I may but first have taken my son in myarms and mourned him to my heart's comforting.""

ííííSo saying he lifted the lids of his chests, and took out twelvegoodly vestments. He took also twelve cloaks of single fold, twelverugs, twelve fair mantles, and an equal number of shirts. He weighedout ten talents of gold, and brought moreover two burnished tripods,four cauldrons, and a very beautiful cup which the Thracians had givenhim when he had gone to them on an embassy; it was very precious,but he grudged not even this, so eager was he to ransom the body ofhis son. Then he chased all the Trojans from the court and rebukedthem with words of anger. ""Out,"" he cried, ""shame and disgrace to methat you are. Have you no grief in your own homes that you are come toplague me here? Is it a small thing, think you, that the son of Saturnhas sent this sorrow upon me, to lose the bravest of my sons? Nay, youshall prove it in person, for now he is gone the Achaeans will haveeasier work in killing you. As for me, let me go down within the houseof Hades, ere mine eyes behold the sacking and wasting of the city.""

ííííHe drove the men away with his staff, and they went forth as the oldman sped them. Then he called to his sons, upbraiding Helenus,Paris, noble Agathon, Pammon, Antiphonus, Polites of the loudbattle-cry, Deiphobus, Hippothous, and Dius. These nine did the oldman call near him. ""Come to me at once,"" he cried, ""worthless sons whodo me shame; would that you had all been killed at the ships ratherthan Hector. Miserable man that I am, I have had the bravest sons inall Troy- noble Nestor, Troilus the dauntless charioteer, and Hectorwho was a god among men, so that one would have thought he was sonto an immortal- yet there is not one of them left. Mars has slain themand those of whom I am ashamed are alone left me. Liars, and lightof foot, heroes of the dance, robbers of lambs and kids from yourown people, why do you not get a waggon ready for me at once, andput all these things upon it that I may set out on my way?""

ííííThus did he speak, and they feared the rebuke of their father.They brought out a strong mule-waggon, newly made, and set the body ofthe waggon fast on its bed. They took the mule-yoke from the peg onwhich it hung, a yoke of boxwood with a knob on the top of it andrings for the reins to go through. Then they brought a yoke-bandeleven cubits long, to bind the yoke to the pole; they bound it onat the far end of the pole, and put the ring over the upright pinmaking it fast with three turns of the band on either side the knob,and bending the thong of the yoke beneath it. This done, theybrought from the store-chamber the rich ransom that was to purchasethe body of Hector, and they set it all orderly on the waggon; thenthey yoked the strong harness-mules which the Mysians had on a timegiven as a goodly present to Priam; but for Priam himself they yokedhorses which the old king had bred, and kept for own use.

ííííThus heedfully did Priam and his servant see to the yolking of theircars at the palace. Then Hecuba came to them all sorrowful, with agolden goblet of wine in her right hand, that they might make adrink-offering before they set out. She stood in front of the horsesand said, ""Take this, make a drink-offering to father Jove, andsince you are minded to go to the ships in spite of me, pray thatyou may come safely back from the hands of your enemies. Pray to theson of Saturn lord of the whirlwind, who sits on Ida and looks downover all Troy, pray him to send his swift messenger on your righthand, the bird of omen which is strongest and most dear to him ofall birds, that you may see it with your own eyes and trust it asyou go forth to the ships of the Danaans. If all-seeing Jove willnot send you this messenger, however set upon it you may be, I wouldnot have you go to the ships of the Argives.""

ííííAnd Priam answered, ""Wife, I will do as you desire me; it is well tolift hands in prayer to Jove, if so be he may have mercy upon me.""

ííííWith this the old man bade the serving-woman pour pure water overhis hands, and the woman came, bearing the water in a bowl. Hewashed his hands and took the cup from his wife; then he made thedrink-offering and prayed, standing in the middle of the courtyard andturning his eyes to heaven. ""Father Jove,"" he said, ""that rulestfrom Ida, most glorious and most great, grant that I may be receivedkindly and compassionately in the tents of Achilles; and send yourswift messenger upon my right hand, the bird of omen which isstrongest and most dear to you of all birds, that I may see it with myown eyes and trust it as I go forth to the ships of the Danaans.""

ííííSo did he pray, and Jove the lord of counsel heard his prayer.Forthwith he sent an eagle, the most unerring portent of all birdsthat fly, the dusky hunter that men also call the Black Eagle. Hiswings were spread abroad on either side as wide as the well-made andwell-bolted door of a rich man's chamber. He came to them flyingover the city upon their right hands, and when they saw him theywere glad and their hearts took comfort within them. The old manmade haste to mount his chariot, and drove out through the innergateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court. Before himwent the mules drawing the four-wheeled waggon, and driven by wiseIdaeus; behind these were the horses, which the old man lashed withhis whip and drove swiftly through the city, while his friendsfollowed after, wailing and lamenting for him as though he were on hisroad to death. As soon as they had come down from the city and hadreached the plain, his sons and sons-in-law who had followed himwent back to Ilius.

ííííBut Priam and Idaeus as they showed out upon the plain did notescape the ken of all-seeing Jove, who looked down upon the old manand pitied him; then he spoke to his son Mercury and said, ""Mercury,for it is you who are the most disposed to escort men on their way,and to hear those whom you will hear, go, and so conduct Priam tothe ships of the Achaeans that no other of the Danaans shall see himnor take note of him until he reach the son of Peleus.""

ííííThus he spoke and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus,did as he was told. Forthwith he bound on his glittering goldensandals with which he could fly like the wind over land and sea; hetook the wand with which he seals men's eyes in sleep, or wakes themjust as he pleases, and flew holding it in his hand till he came toTroy and to the Hellespont. To look at, he was like a young man ofnoble birth in the hey-day of his youth and beauty with the downjust coming upon his face.

ííííNow when Priam and Idaeus had driven past the great tomb of Ilius,they stayed their mules and horses that they might drink in the river,for the shades of night were falling, when, therefore, Idaeus sawMercury standing near them he said to Priam, ""Take heed, descendant ofDardanus; here is matter which demands consideration. I see a manwho I think will presently fall upon us; let us fly with our horses,or at least embrace his knees and implore him to take compassionupon us?

ííííWhen he heard this the old man's heart failed him, and he was ingreat fear; he stayed where he was as one dazed, and the hair stood onend over his whole body; but the bringer of good luck came up to himand took him by the hand, saying, ""Whither, father, are you thusdriving your mules and horses in the dead of night when other menare asleep? Are you not afraid of the fierce Achaeans who are hardby you, so cruel and relentless? Should some one of them see youbearing so much treasure through the darkness of the flying night,what would not your state then be? You are no longer young, and he whois with you is too old to protect you from those who would attack you.For myself, I will do you no harm, and I will defend you from anyone else, for you remind me of my own father.""

ííííAnd Priam answered, ""It is indeed as you say, my dear son;nevertheless some god has held his hand over me, in that he has sentsuch a wayfarer as yourself to meet me so Opportunely; you are socomely in mien and figure, and your judgement is so excellent that youmust come of blessed parents.""

ííííThen said the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, ""Sir, all thatyou have said is right; but tell me and tell me true, are you takingthis rich treasure to send it to a foreign people where it may besafe, or are you all leaving strong Ilius in dismay now that yourson has fallen who was the bravest man among you and was never lackingin battle with the Achaeans?""

ííííAnd Priam said, ""Wo are you, my friend, and who are your parents,that you speak so truly about the fate of my unhappy son?""

ííííThe slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, answered him, ""Sir, youwould prove me, that you question me about noble Hector. Many a timehave I set eyes upon him in battle when he was driving the Argivesto their ships and putting them to the sword. We stood still andmarvelled, for Achilles in his anger with the son of Atreus sufferedus not to fight. I am his squire, and came with him in the sameship. I am a Myrmidon, and my father's name is Polyctor: he is arich man and about as old as you are; he has six sons besidesmyself, and I am the seventh. We cast lots, and it fell upon me tosail hither with Achilles. I am now come from the ships on to theplain, for with daybreak the Achaeans will set battle in array aboutthe city. They chafe at doing nothing, and are so eager that theirprinces cannot hold them back.""

ííííThen answered Priam, ""If you are indeed the squire of Achilles sonof Peleus, tell me now the Whole truth. Is my son still at theships, or has Achilles hewn him limb from limb, and given him to hishounds?""

íííí""Sir,"" replied the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, ""neitherhounds nor vultures have yet devoured him; he is still just lying atthe tents by the ship of Achilles, and though it is now twelve daysthat he has lain there, his flesh is not wasted nor have the wormseaten him although they feed on warriors. At daybreak Achilles dragshim cruelly round the sepulchre of his dear comrade, but it does himno hurt. You should come yourself and see how he lies fresh as dew,with the blood all washed away, and his wounds every one of themclosed though many pierced him with their spears. Such care have theblessed gods taken of your brave son, for he was dear to them beyondall measure.""

ííííThe old man was comforted as he heard him and said, ""My son, seewhat a good thing it is to have made due offerings to the immortals;for as sure as that he was born my son never forgot the gods that holdOlympus, and now they requite it to him even in death. Accepttherefore at my hands this goodly chalice; guard me and withheaven's help guide me till I come to the tent of the son of Peleus.""

ííííThen answered the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, ""Sir, you aretempting me and playing upon my youth, but you shall not move me,for you are offering me presents without the knowledge of Achilleswhom I fear and hold it great guiltless to defraud, lest some evilpresently befall me; but as your guide I would go with you even toArgos itself, and would guard you so carefully whether by sea or land,that no one should attack you through making light of him who was withyou.""

ííííThe bringer of good luck then sprang on to the chariot, andseizing the whip and reins he breathed fresh spirit into the mules andhorses. When they reached the trench and the wall that was beforethe ships, those who were on guard had just been getting theirsuppers, and the slayer of Argus threw them all into a deep sleep.Then he drew back the bolts to open the gates, and took Priam insidewith the treasure he had upon his waggon. Ere long they came to thelofty dwelling of the son of Peleus for which the Myrmidons had cutpine and which they had built for their king; when they had built itthey thatched it with coarse tussock-grass which they had mown outon the plain, and all round it they made a large courtyard, whichwas fenced with stakes set close together. The gate was barred witha single bolt of pine which it took three men to force into its place,and three to draw back so as to open the gate, but Achilles could drawit by himself. Mercury opened the gate for the old man, and brought inthe treasure that he was taking with him for the son of Peleus. Thenhe sprang from the chariot on to the ground and said, ""Sir, it is I,immortal Mercury, that am come with you, for my father sent me toescort you. I will now leave you, and will not enter into the presenceof Achilles, for it might anger him that a god should befriendmortal men thus openly. Go you within, and embrace the knees of theson of Peleus: beseech him by his father, his lovely mother, and hisson; thus you may move him.""

ííííWith these words Mercury went back to high Olympus. Priam sprangfrom his chariot to the ground, leaving Idaeus where he was, in chargeof the mules and horses. The old man went straight into the housewhere Achilles, loved of the gods, was sitting. There he found himwith his men seated at a distance from him: only two, the heroAutomedon, and Alcimus of the race of Mars, were busy in attendanceabout his person, for he had but just done eating and drinking, andthe table was still there. King Priam entered without their seeinghim, and going right up to Achilles he clasped his knees and kissedthe dread murderous hands that had slain so many of his sons.

ííííAs when some cruel spite has befallen a man that he should havekilled some one in his own country, and must fly to a great man'sprotection in a land of strangers, and all marvel who see him, even sodid Achilles marvel as he beheld Priam. The others looked one toanother and marvelled also, but Priam besought Achilles saying, ""Thinkof your father, O Achilles like unto the gods, who is such even as Iam, on the sad threshold of old age. It may be that those who dwellnear him harass him, and there is none to keep war and ruin fromhim. Yet when he hears of you being still alive, he is glad, and hisdays are full of hope that he shall see his dear son come home tohim from Troy; but I, wretched man that I am, had the bravest in allTroy for my sons, and there is not one of them left. I had fiftysons when the Achaeans came here; nineteen of them were from asingle womb, and the others were borne to me by the women of myhousehold. The greater part of them has fierce Mars laid low, andHector, him who was alone left, him who was the guardian of the cityand ourselves, him have you lately slain; therefore I am now come tothe ships of the Achaeans to ransom his body from you with a greatransom. Fear, O Achilles, the wrath of heaven; think on your ownfather and have compassion upon me, who am the more pitiable, for Ihave steeled myself as no man yet has ever steeled himself beforeme, and have raised to my lips the hand of him who slew my son.""

ííííThus spoke Priam, and the heart of Achilles yearned as hebethought him of his father. He took the old man's hand and movedhim gently away. The two wept bitterly- Priam, as he lay atAchilles' feet, weeping for Hector, and Achilles now for his fatherand now for Patroclous, till the house was filled with theirlamentation. But when Achilles was now sated with grief and hadunburthened the bitterness of his sorrow, he left his seat andraised the old man by the hand, in pity for his white hair andbeard; then he said, ""Unhappy man, you have indeed been greatlydaring; how could you venture to come alone to the ships of theAchaeans, and enter the presence of him who has slain so many ofyour brave sons? You must have iron courage: sit now upon this seat,and for all our grief we will hide our sorrows in our hearts, forweeping will not avail us. The immortals know no care, yet the lotthey spin for man is full of sorrow; on the floor of Jove's palacethere stand two urns, the one filled with evil gifts, and the otherwith good ones. He for whom Jove the lord of thunder mixes the giftshe sends, will meet now with good and now with evil fortune; but he towhom Jove sends none but evil gifts will be pointed at by the fingerof scorn, the hand of famine will pursue him to the ends of the world,and he will go up and down the face of the earth, respected neither bygods nor men. Even so did it befall Peleus; the gods endowed himwith all good things from his birth upwards, for he reigned over theMyrmidons excelling all men in prosperity and wealth, and mortalthough he was they gave him a goddess for his bride. But even on himtoo did heaven send misfortune, for there is no race of royal childrenborn to him in his house, save one son who is doomed to die alluntimely; nor may I take care of him now that he is growing old, for Imust stay here at Troy to be the bane of you and your children. Andyou too, O Priam, I have heard that you were aforetime happy. They saythat in wealth and plenitude of offspring you surpassed all that is inLesbos, the realm of Makar to the northward, Phrygia that is moreinland, and those that dwell upon the great Hellespont; but from theday when the dwellers in heaven sent this evil upon you, war andslaughter have been about your city continually. Bear up against it,and let there be some intervals in your sorrow. Mourn as you may foryour brave son, you will take nothing by it. You cannot raise him fromthe dead, ere you do so yet another sorrow shall befall you.""

ííííAnd Priam answered, ""O king, bid me not be seated, while Hector isstill lying uncared for in your tents, but accept the great ransomwhich I have brought you, and give him to me at once that I may lookupon him. May you prosper with the ransom and reach your own land insafety, seeing that you have suffered me to live and to look uponthe light of the sun.""

ííííAchilles looked at him sternly and said, ""Vex me, sir, no longer;I am of myself minded to give up the body of Hector. My mother,daughter of the old man of the sea, came to me from Jove to bid medeliver it to you. Moreover I know well, O Priam, and you cannothide it, that some god has brought you to the ships of the Achaeans,for else, no man however strong and in his prime would dare to come toour host; he could neither pass our guard unseen, nor draw the bolt ofmy gates thus easily; therefore, provoke me no further, lest I sinagainst the word of Jove, and suffer you not, suppliant though youare, within my tents.""

ííííThe old man feared him and obeyed. Then the son of Peleus spranglike a lion through the door of his house, not alone, but with himwent his two squires Automedon and Alcimus who were closer to him thanany others of his comrades now that Patroclus was no more. Theseunyoked the horses and mules, and bade Priam's herald and attendant beseated within the house. They lifted the ransom for Hector's body fromthe waggon. but they left two mantles and a goodly shirt, thatAchilles might wrap the body in them when he gave it to be taken home.Then he called to his servants and ordered them to wash the body andanoint it, but he first took it to a place where Priam should notsee it, lest if he did so, he should break out in the bitterness ofhis grief, and enrage Achilles, who might then kill him and sinagainst the word of Jove. When the servants had washed the body andanointed it, and had wrapped it in a fair shirt and mantle, Achilleshimself lifted it on to a bier, and he and his men then laid it on thewaggon. He cried aloud as he did so and called on the name of his dearcomrade, ""Be not angry with me, Patroclus,"" he said, ""if you hear evenin the house of Hades that I have given Hector to his father for aransom. It has been no unworthy one, and I will share it equitablywith you.""

ííííAchilles then went back into the tent and took his place on therichly inlaid seat from which he had risen, by the wall that was atright angles to the one against which Priam was sitting. ""Sir,"" hesaid, ""your son is now laid upon his bier and is ransomed according todesire; you shall look upon him when you him away at daybreak; for thepresent let us prepare our supper. Even lovely Niobe had to thinkabout eating, though her twelve children- six daughters and sixlusty sons- had been all slain in her house. Apollo killed the sonswith arrows from his silver bow, to punish Niobe, and Diana slew thedaughters, because Niobe had vaunted herself against Leto; she saidLeto had borne two children only, whereas she had herself bornemany- whereon the two killed the many. Nine days did they lieweltering, and there was none to bury them, for the son of Saturnturned the people into stone; but on the tenth day the gods inheaven themselves buried them, and Niobe then took food, being wornout with weeping. They say that somewhere among the rocks on themountain pastures of Sipylus, where the nymphs live that haunt theriver Achelous, there, they say, she lives in stone and still nursesthe sorrows sent upon her by the hand of heaven. Therefore, noble sir,let us two now take food; you can weep for your dear son hereafteras you are bearing him back to Ilius- and many a tear will he costyou.""

ííííWith this Achilles sprang from his seat and killed a sheep ofsilvery whiteness, which his followers skinned and made ready all indue order. They cut the meat carefully up into smaller pieces, spittedthem, and drew them off again when they were well roasted. Automedonbrought bread in fair baskets and served it round the table, whileAchilles dealt out the meat, and they laid their hands on the goodthings that were before them. As soon as they had had enough to eatand drink, Priam, descendant of Dardanus, marvelled at the strengthand beauty of Achilles for he was as a god to see, and Achillesmarvelled at Priam as he listened to him and looked upon his noblepresence. When they had gazed their fill Priam spoke first. ""Andnow, O king,"" he said, ""take me to my couch that we may lie down andenjoy the blessed boon of sleep. Never once have my eyes been closedfrom the day your hands took the life of my son; I have grovelledwithout ceasing in the mire of my stable-yard, making moan andbrooding over my countless sorrows. Now, moreover, I have eatenbread and drunk wine; hitherto I have tasted nothing.""

ííííAs he spoke Achilles told his men and the women-servants to set bedsin the room that was in the gatehouse, and make them with good redrugs, and spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaksfor Priam and Idaeus to wear. So the maids went out carrying a torchand got the two beds ready in all haste. Then Achilles said laughinglyto Priam, ""Dear sir, you shall lie outside, lest some counsellor ofthose who in due course keep coming to advise with me should see youhere in the darkness of the flying night, and tell it to Agamemnon.This might cause delay in the delivery of the body. And now tell meand tell me true, for how many days would you celebrate the funeralrites of noble Hector? Tell me, that I may hold aloof from war andrestrain the host.""

ííííAnd Priam answered, ""Since, then, you suffer me to bury my noble sonwith all due rites, do thus, Achilles, and I shall be grateful. Youknow how we are pent up within our city; it is far for us to fetchwood from the mountain, and the people live in fear. Nine days,therefore, will we mourn Hector in my house; on the tenth day wewill bury him and there shall be a public feast in his honour; onthe eleventh we will build a mound over his ashes, and on the twelfth,if there be need, we will fight.""

ííííAnd Achilles answered, ""All, King Priam, shall be as you havesaid. I will stay our fighting for as long a time as you have named.""

ííííAs he spoke he laid his hand on the old man's right wrist, intoken that he should have no fear; thus then did Priam and hisattendant sleep there in the forecourt, full of thought, whileAchilles lay in an inner room of the house, with fair Briseis by hisside.

ííííAnd now both gods and mortals were fast asleep through thelivelong night, but upon Mercury alone, the bringer of good luck,sleep could take no hold for he was thinking all the time how to getKing Priam away from the ships without his being seen by the strongforce of sentinels. He hovered therefore over Priam's head and said,""Sir, now that Achilles has spared your life, you seem to have no fearabout sleeping in the thick of your foes. You have paid a greatransom, and have received the body of your son; were you still aliveand a prisoner the sons whom you have left at home would have togive three times as much to free you; and so it would be ifAgamemnon and the other Achaeans were to know of your being here.""

ííííWhen he heard this the old man was afraid and roused his servant.Mercury then yoked their horses and mules, and drove them quicklythrough the host so that no man perceived them. When they came tothe ford of eddying Xanthus, begotten of immortal Jove, Mercury wentback to high Olympus, and dawn in robe of saffron began to breakover all the land. Priam and Idaeus then drove on toward the citylamenting and making moan, and the mules drew the body of Hector. Noone neither man nor woman saw them, till Cassandra, fair as goldenVenus standing on Pergamus, caught sight of her dear father in hischariot, and his servant that was the city's herald with him. Then shesaw him that was lying upon the bier, drawn by the mules, and with aloud cry she went about the city saying, ""Come hither Trojans, men andwomen, and look on Hector; if ever you rejoiced to see him coming frombattle when he was alive, look now on him that was the glory of ourcity and all our people.""

ííííAt this there was not man nor woman left in the city, so great asorrow had possessed them. Hard by the gates they met Priam as hewas bringing in the body. Hector's wife and his mother were thefirst to mourn him: they flew towards the waggon and laid theirhands upon his head, while the crowd stood weeping round them. Theywould have stayed before the gates, weeping and lamenting the livelongday to the going down of the sun, had not Priam spoken to them fromthe chariot and said, ""Make way for the mules to pass you.Afterwards when I have taken the body home you shall have your fill ofweeping.""

ííííOn this the people stood asunder, and made a way for the waggon.When they had borne the body within the house they laid it upon abed and seated minstrels round it to lead the dirge, whereon the womenjoined in the sad music of their lament. Foremost among them allAndromache led their wailing as she clasped the head of mightyHector in her embrace. ""Husband,"" she cried, ""you have died young, andleave me in your house a widow; he of whom we are the ill-starredparents is still a mere child, and I fear he may not reach manhood.Ere he can do so our city will be razed and overthrown, for you whowatched over it are no more- you who were its saviour, the guardian ofour wives and children. Our women will be carried away captives to theships, and I among them; while you, my child, who will be with me willbe put to some unseemly tasks, working for a cruel master. Or, may be,some Achaean will hurl you (O miserable death) from our walls, toavenge some brother, son, or father whom Hector slew; many of themhave indeed bitten the dust at his hands, for your father's hand inbattle was no light one. Therefore do the people mourn him. You haveleft, O Hector, sorrow unutterable to your parents, and my own griefis greatest of all, for you did not stretch forth your arms andembrace me as you lay dying, nor say to me any words that might havelived with me in my tears night and day for evermore.""

ííííBitterly did she weep the while, and the women joined in her lament.Hecuba in her turn took up the strains of woe. ""Hector,"" she cried,""dearest to me of all my children. So long as you were alive thegods loved you well, and even in death they have not been utterlyunmindful of you; for when Achilles took any other of my sons, hewould sell him beyond the seas, to Samos Imbrus or rugged Lemnos;and when he had slain you too with his sword, many a time did hedrag you round the sepulchre of his comrade- though this could notgive him life- yet here you lie all fresh as dew, and comely as onewhom Apollo has slain with his painless shafts.""

ííííThus did she too speak through her tears with bitter moan, andthen Helen for a third time took up the strain of lamentation.""Hector,"" said she, ""dearest of all my brothers-in-law-for I am wifeto Alexandrus who brought me hither to Troy- would that I had died erehe did so- twenty years are come and gone since I left my home andcame from over the sea, but I have never heard one word of insult orunkindness from you. When another would chide with me, as it mightbe one of your brothers or sisters or of your brothers' wives, or mymother-in-law- for Priam was as kind to me as though he were my ownfather- you would rebuke and check them with words of gentleness andgoodwill. Therefore my tears flow both for you and for my unhappyself, for there is no one else in Troy who is kind to me, but allshrink and shudder as they go by me.""

ííííShe wept as she spoke and the vast crowd that was gathered round herjoined in her lament. Then King Priam spoke to them saying, ""Bringwood, O Trojans, to the city, and fear no cunning ambush of theArgives, for Achilles when he dismissed me from the ships gave mehis word that they should not attack us until the morning of thetwelfth day.""

ííííForthwith they yoked their oxen and mules and gathered togetherbefore the city. Nine days long did they bring in great heaps wood,and on the morning of the tenth day with many tears they took traveHector forth, laid his dead body upon the summit of the pile, andset the fire thereto. Then when the child of morning rosy-fingereddawn appeared on the eleventh day, the people again assembled, roundthe pyre of mighty Hector. When they were got together, they firstquenched the fire with wine wherever it was burning, and then hisbrothers and comrades with many a bitter tear gathered his whitebones, wrapped them in soft robes of purple, and laid them in a goldenurn, which they placed in a grave and covered over with large stonesset close together. Then they built a barrow hurriedly over it keepingguard on every side lest the Achaeans should attack them before theyhad finished. When they had heaped up the barrow they went backagain into the city, and being well assembled they held high feastin the house of Priam their king.

ííííThus, then, did they celebrate the funeral of Hector tamer ofhorses.

ííííby Homer

íííítranslated by Samuel Butler

ííííBOOK I.

ííííTELL ME, O MUSE, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wideafter he had sacked the famous town of Troy. Many cities did he visit,and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he wasacquainted; moreover he suffered much by sea while trying to savehis own life and bring his men safely home; but do what he might hecould not save his men, for they perished through their own sheerfolly in eating the cattle of the Sun-god Hyperion; so the godprevented them from ever reaching home. Tell me, too, about allthese things, O daughter of Jove, from whatsoever source you mayknow them.

ííííSo now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had gotsafely home except Ulysses, and he, though he was longing to return tohis wife and country, was detained by the goddess Calypso, who had gothim into a large cave and wanted to marry him. But as years went by,there came a time when the gods settled that he should go back toIthaca; even then, however, when he was among his own people, histroubles were not yet over; nevertheless all the gods had now begun topity him except Neptune, who still persecuted him without ceasingand would not let him get home.

ííííNow Neptune had gone off to the Ethiopians, who are at the world'send, and lie in two halves, the one looking West and the other East.He had gone there to accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen, and wasenjoying himself at his festival; but the other gods met in thehouse of Olympian Jove, and the sire of gods and men spoke first. Atthat moment he was thinking of Aegisthus, who had been killed byAgamemnon's son Orestes; so he said to the other gods:

íííí""See now, how men lay blame upon us gods for what is after allnothing but their own folly. Look at Aegisthus; he must needs makelove to Agamemnon's wife unrighteously and then kill Agamemnon, thoughhe knew it would be the death of him; for I sent Mercury to warn himnot to do either of these things, inasmuch as Orestes would be sure totake his revenge when he grew up and wanted to return home. Mercurytold him this in all good will but he would not listen, and now he haspaid for everything in full.""

ííííThen Minerva said, ""Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, itserved Aegisthus right, and so it would any one else who does as hedid; but Aegisthus is neither here nor there; it is for Ulysses thatmy heart bleeds, when I think of his sufferings in that lonelysea-girt island, far away, poor man, from all his friends. It is anisland covered with forest, in the very middle of the sea, and agoddess lives there, daughter of the magician Atlas, who looks afterthe bottom of the ocean, and carries the great columns that keepheaven and earth asunder. This daughter of Atlas has got hold ofpoor unhappy Ulysses, and keeps trying by every kind of blandishmentto make him forget his home, so that he is tired of life, and thinksof nothing but how he may once more see the smoke of his own chimneys.You, sir, take no heed of this, and yet when Ulysses was before Troydid he not propitiate you with many a burnt sacrifice? Why then shouldyou keep on being so angry with him?""

ííííAnd Jove said, ""My child, what are you talking about? How can Iforget Ulysses than whom there is no more capable man on earth, normore liberal in his offerings to the immortal gods that live inheaven? Bear in mind, however, that Neptune is still furious withUlysses for having blinded an eye of Polyphemus king of theCyclopes. Polyphemus is son to Neptune by the nymph Thoosa, daughterto the sea-king Phorcys; therefore though he will not kill Ulyssesoutright, he torments him by preventing him from getting home.Still, let us lay our heads together and see how we can help him toreturn; Neptune will then be pacified, for if we are all of a mindhe can hardly stand out against us.""

ííííAnd Minerva said, ""Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, if, then,the gods now mean that Ulysses should get home, we should first sendMercury to the Ogygian island to tell Calypso that we have made up ourminds and that he is to return. In the meantime I will go to Ithaca,to put heart into Ulysses' son Telemachus; I will embolden him to callthe Achaeans in assembly, and speak out to the suitors of his motherPenelope, who persist in eating up any number of his sheep and oxen; Iwill also conduct him to Sparta and to Pylos, to see if he can hearanything about the return of his dear father- for this will makepeople speak well of him.""

ííííSo saying she bound on her glittering golden sandals,imperishable, with which she can fly like the wind over land or sea;she grasped the redoubtable bronze-shod spear, so stout and sturdy andstrong, wherewith she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeasedher, and down she darted from the topmost summits of Olympus,whereon forthwith she was in Ithaca, at the gateway of Ulysses' house,disguised as a visitor, Mentes, chief of the Taphians, and she helda bronze spear in her hand. There she found the lordly suitorsseated on hides of the oxen which they had killed and eaten, andplaying draughts in front of the house. Men-servants and pages werebustling about to wait upon them, some mixing wine with water in themixing-bowls, some cleaning down the tables with wet sponges andlaying them out again, and some cutting up great quantities of meat.

ííííTelemachus saw her long before any one else did. He was sittingmoodily among the suitors thinking about his brave father, and howhe would send them flying out of the house, if he were to come tohis own again and be honoured as in days gone by. Thus brooding ashe sat among them, he caught sight of Minerva and went straight to thegate, for he was vexed that a stranger should be kept waiting foradmittance. He took her right hand in his own, and bade her give himher spear. ""Welcome,"" said he, ""to our house, and when you havepartaken of food you shall tell us what you have come for.""

ííííHe led the way as he spoke, and Minerva followed him. When they werewithin he took her spear and set it in the spear- stand against astrong bearing-post along with the many other spears of his unhappyfather, and he conducted her to a richly decorated seat under which hethrew a cloth of damask. There was a footstool also for her feet,and he set another seat near her for himself, away from the suitors,that she might not be annoyed while eating by their noise andinsolence, and that he might ask her more freely about his father.

ííííA maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewerand poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands, andshe drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought thembread, and offered them many good things of what there was in thehouse, the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and setcups of gold by their side, and a man-servant brought them wine andpoured it out for them.

ííííThen the suitors came in and took their places on the benches andseats. Forthwith men servants poured water over their hands, maidswent round with the bread-baskets, pages filled the mixing-bowlswith wine and water, and they laid their hands upon the good thingsthat were before them. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drinkthey wanted music and dancing, which are the crowning embellishmentsof a banquet, so a servant brought a lyre to Phemius, whom theycompelled perforce to sing to them. As soon as he touched his lyre andbegan to sing Telemachus spoke low to Minerva, with his head closeto hers that no man might hear.

íííí""I hope, sir,"" said he, ""that you will not be offended with what Iam going to say. Singing comes cheap to those who do not pay for it,and all this is done at the cost of one whose bones lie rotting insome wilderness or grinding to powder in the surf. If these men wereto see my father come back to Ithaca they would pray for longer legsrather than a longer purse, for money would not serve them; but he,alas, has fallen on an ill fate, and even when people do sometimes saythat he is coming, we no longer heed them; we shall never see himagain. And now, sir, tell me and tell me true, who you are and whereyou come from. Tell me of your town and parents, what manner of shipyou came in, how your crew brought you to Ithaca, and of what nationthey declared themselves to be- for you cannot have come by land. Tellme also truly, for I want to know, are you a stranger to this house,or have you been here in my father's time? In the old days we had manyvisitors for my father went about much himself.""

ííííAnd Minerva answered, ""I will tell you truly and particularly allabout it. I am Mentes, son of Anchialus, and I am King of theTaphians. I have come here with my ship and crew, on a voyage to menof a foreign tongue being bound for Temesa with a cargo of iron, and Ishall bring back copper. As for my ship, it lies over yonder off theopen country away from the town, in the harbour Rheithron under thewooded mountain Neritum. Our fathers were friends before us, as oldLaertes will tell you, if you will go and ask him. They say,however, that he never comes to town now, and lives by himself inthe country, faring hardly, with an old woman to look after him andget his dinner for him, when he comes in tired from pottering abouthis vineyard. They told me your father was at home again, and that waswhy I came, but it seems the gods are still keeping him back, for heis not dead yet not on the mainland. It is more likely he is on somesea-girt island in mid ocean, or a prisoner among savages who aredetaining him against his will I am no prophet, and know very littleabout omens, but I speak as it is borne in upon me from heaven, andassure you that he will not be away much longer; for he is a man ofsuch resource that even though he were in chains of iron he would findsome means of getting home again. But tell me, and tell me true, canUlysses really have such a fine looking fellow for a son? You areindeed wonderfully like him about the head and eyes, for we were closefriends before he set sail for Troy where the flower of all theArgives went also. Since that time we have never either of us seen theother.""

íííí""My mother,"" answered Telemachus, tells me I am son to Ulysses,but it is a wise child that knows his own father. Would that I wereson to one who had grown old upon his own estates, for, since youask me, there is no more ill-starred man under heaven than he who theytell me is my father.""

ííííAnd Minerva said, ""There is no fear of your race dying out yet,while Penelope has such a fine son as you are. But tell me, and tellme true, what is the meaning of all this feasting, and who are thesepeople? What is it all about? Have you some banquet, or is there awedding in the family- for no one seems to be bringing anyprovisions of his own? And the guests- how atrociously they arebehaving; what riot they make over the whole house; it is enough todisgust any respectable person who comes near them.""

íííí""Sir,"" said Telemachus, ""as regards your question, so long as myfather was here it was well with us and with the house, but the godsin their displeasure have willed it otherwise, and have hidden himaway more closely than mortal man was ever yet hidden. I could haveborne it better even though he were dead, if he had fallen with hismen before Troy, or had died with friends around him when the daysof his fighting were done; for then the Achaeans would have built amound over his ashes, and I should myself have been heir to hisrenown; but now the storm-winds have spirited him away we know notwither; he is gone without leaving so much as a trace behind him,and I inherit nothing but dismay. Nor does the matter end simplywith grief for the loss of my father; heaven has laid sorrows uponme of yet another kind; for the chiefs from all our islands,Dulichium, Same, and the woodland island of Zacynthus, as also all theprincipal men of Ithaca itself, are eating up my house under thepretext of paying their court to my mother, who will neither pointblank say that she will not marry, nor yet bring matters to an end; sothey are making havoc of my estate, and before long will do so alsowith myself.""

íííí""Is that so?"" exclaimed Minerva, ""then you do indeed want Ulysseshome again. Give him his helmet, shield, and a couple lances, and ifhe is the man he was when I first knew him in our house, drinkingand making merry, he would soon lay his hands about these rascallysuitors, were he to stand once more upon his own threshold. He wasthen coming from Ephyra, where he had been to beg poison for hisarrows from Ilus, son of Mermerus. Ilus feared the ever-living godsand would not give him any, but my father let him have some, for hewas very fond of him. If Ulysses is the man he then was thesesuitors will have a short shrift and a sorry wedding.

íííí""But there! It rests with heaven to determine whether he is toreturn, and take his revenge in his own house or no; I would, however,urge you to set about trying to get rid of these suitors at once. Takemy advice, call the Achaean heroes in assembly to-morrow -lay yourcase before them, and call heaven to bear you witness. Bid the suitorstake themselves off, each to his own place, and if your mother'smind is set on marrying again, let her go back to her father, who willfind her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts that sodear a daughter may expect. As for yourself, let me prevail upon youto take the best ship you can get, with a crew of twenty men, and goin quest of your father who has so long been missing. Some one maytell you something, or (and people often hear things in this way) someheaven-sent message may direct you. First go to Pylos and askNestor; thence go on to Sparta and visit Menelaus, for he got homelast of all the Achaeans; if you hear that your father is alive and onhis way home, you can put up with the waste these suitors will makefor yet another twelve months. If on the other hand you hear of hisdeath, come home at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all duepomp, build a barrow to his memory, and make your mother marryagain. Then, having done all this, think it well over in your mindhow, by fair means or foul, you may kill these suitors in your ownhouse. You are too old to plead infancy any longer; have you not heardhow people are singing Orestes' praises for having killed his father'smurderer Aegisthus? You are a fine, smart looking fellow; show yourmettle, then, and make yourself a name in story. Now, however, Imust go back to my ship and to my crew, who will be impatient if Ikeep them waiting longer; think the matter over for yourself, andremember what I have said to you.""

íííí""Sir,"" answered Telemachus, ""it has been very kind of you to talk tome in this way, as though I were your own son, and I will do all youtell me; I know you want to be getting on with your voyage, but stay alittle longer till you have taken a bath and refreshed yourself. Iwill then give you a present, and you shall go on your wayrejoicing; I will give you one of great beauty and value- a keepsakesuch as only dear friends give to one another.""

ííííMinerva answered, ""Do not try to keep me, for I would be on my wayat once. As for any present you may be disposed to make me, keep ittill I come again, and I will take it home with me. You shall giveme a very good one, and I will give you one of no less value inreturn.""

ííííWith these words she flew away like a bird into the air, but she hadgiven Telemachus courage, and had made him think more than everabout his father. He felt the change, wondered at it, and knew thatthe stranger had been a god, so he went straight to where thesuitors were sitting.

ííííPhemius was still singing, and his hearers sat rapt in silence as hetold the sad tale of the return from Troy, and the ills Minerva hadlaid upon the Achaeans. Penelope, daughter of Icarius, heard hissong from her room upstairs, and came down by the great staircase, notalone, but attended by two of her handmaids. When she reached thesuitors she stood by one of the bearing posts that supported theroof of the cloisters with a staid maiden on either side of her. Sheheld a veil, moreover, before her face, and was weeping bitterly.

íííí""Phemius,"" she cried, ""you know many another feat of gods andheroes, such as poets love to celebrate. Sing the suitors some oneof these, and let them drink their wine in silence, but cease this sadtale, for it breaks my sorrowful heart, and reminds me of my losthusband whom I mourn ever without ceasing, and whose name was greatover all Hellas and middle Argos.""

íííí""Mother,"" answered Telemachus, ""let the bard sing what he has a mindto; bards do not make the ills they sing of; it is Jove, not they, whomakes them, and who sends weal or woe upon mankind according to hisown good pleasure. This fellow means no harm by singing theill-fated return of the Danaans, for people always applaud thelatest songs most warmly. Make up your mind to it and bear it; Ulyssesis not the only man who never came back from Troy, but many anotherwent down as well as he. Go, then, within the house and busyyourself with your daily duties, your loom, your distaff, and theordering of your servants; for speech is man's matter, and mineabove all others- for it is I who am master here.""

ííííShe went wondering back into the house, and laid her son's saying inher heart. Then, going upstairs with her handmaids into her room,she mourned her dear husband till Minerva shed sweet sleep over hereyes. But the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloisters,and prayed each one that he might be her bed fellow.

ííííThen Telemachus spoke, ""Shameless,"" he cried, ""and insolent suitors,let us feast at our pleasure now, and let there be no brawling, for itis a rare thing to hear a man with such a divine voice as Phemius has;but in the morning meet me in full assembly that I may give you formalnotice to depart, and feast at one another's houses, turn and turnabout, at your own cost. If on the other hand you choose to persist inspunging upon one man, heaven help me, but Jove shall reckon withyou in full, and when you fall in my father's house there shall beno man to avenge you.""

ííííThe suitors bit their lips as they heard him, and marvelled at theboldness of his speech. Then, Antinous, son of Eupeithes, said, ""Thegods seem to have given you lessons in bluster and tall talking; mayJove never grant you to be chief in Ithaca as your father was beforeyou.""

ííííTelemachus answered, ""Antinous, do not chide with me, but, godwilling, I will be chief too if I can. Is this the worst fate youcan think of for me? It is no bad thing to be a chief, for it bringsboth riches and honour. Still, now that Ulysses is dead there are manygreat men in Ithaca both old and young, and some other may take thelead among them; nevertheless I will be chief in my own house, andwill rule those whom Ulysses has won for me.""

ííííThen Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered, ""It rests with heavento decide who shall be chief among us, but you shall be master in yourown house and over your own possessions; no one while there is a manin Ithaca shall do you violence nor rob you. And now, my goodfellow, I want to know about this stranger. What country does hecome from? Of what family is he, and where is his estate? Has hebrought you news about the return of your father, or was he onbusiness of his own? He seemed a well-to-do man, but he hurried off sosuddenly that he was gone in a moment before we could get to knowhim.""

íííí""My father is dead and gone,"" answered Telemachus, ""and even if somerumour reaches me I put no more faith in it now. My mother does indeedsometimes send for a soothsayer and question him, but I give hisprophecyings no heed. As for the stranger, he was Mentes, son ofAnchialus, chief of the Taphians, an old friend of my father's."" Butin his heart he knew that it had been the goddess.

ííííThe suitors then returned to their singing and dancing until theevening; but when night fell upon their pleasuring they went home tobed each in his own abode. Telemachus's room was high up in a towerthat looked on to the outer court; hither, then, he hied, brooding andfull of thought. A good old woman, Euryclea, daughter of Ops, theson of Pisenor, went before him with a couple of blazing torches.Laertes had bought her with his own money when she was quite young; hegave the worth of twenty oxen for her, and shewed as much respect toher in his household as he did to his own wedded wife, but he didnot take her to his bed for he feared his wife's resentment. She itwas who now lighted Telemachus to his room, and she loved him betterthan any of the other women in the house did, for she had nursed himwhen he was a baby. He opened the door of his bed room and sat downupon the bed; as he took off his shirt he gave it to the good oldwoman, who folded it tidily up, and hung it for him over a peg byhis bed side, after which she went out, pulled the door to by a silvercatch, and drew the bolt home by means of the strap. But Telemachus ashe lay covered with a woollen fleece kept thinking all night throughof his intended voyage of the counsel that Minerva had given him.

ííííBOOK II.

ííííNOW when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared,Telemachus rose and dressed himself. He bound his sandals on to hiscomely feet, girded his sword about his shoulder, and left his roomlooking like an immortal god. He at once sent the criers round to callthe people in assembly, so they called them and the people gatheredthereon; then, when they were got together, he went to the place ofassembly spear in hand- not alone, for his two hounds went with him.Minerva endowed him with a presence of such divine comeliness that allmarvelled at him as he went by, and when he took his place' in hisfather's seat even the oldest councillors made way for him.

ííííAegyptius, a man bent double with age, and of infinite experience,the first to speak His son Antiphus had gone with Ulysses to Ilius,land of noble steeds, but the savage Cyclops had killed him whenthey were all shut up in the cave, and had cooked his last dinnerfor him, He had three sons left, of whom two still worked on theirfather's land, while the third, Eurynomus, was one of the suitors;nevertheless their father could not get over the loss of Antiphus, andwas still weeping for him when he began his speech.

íííí""Men of Ithaca,"" he said, ""hear my words. From the day Ulyssesleft us there has been no meeting of our councillors until now; whothen can it be, whether old or young, that finds it so necessary toconvene us? Has he got wind of some host approaching, and does he wishto warn us, or would he speak upon some other matter of public moment?I am sure he is an excellent person, and I hope Jove will grant himhis heart's desire.""

ííííTelemachus took this speech as of good omen and rose at once, for hewas bursting with what he had to say. He stood in the middle of theassembly and the good herald Pisenor brought him his staff. Then,turning to Aegyptius, ""Sir,"" said he, ""it is I, as you will shortlylearn, who have convened you, for it is I who am the most aggrieved. Ihave not got wind of any host approaching about which I would warnyou, nor is there any matter of public moment on which I wouldspeak. My grieveance is purely personal, and turns on two greatmisfortunes which have fallen upon my house. The first of these is theloss of my excellent father, who was chief among all you here present,and was like a father to every one of you; the second is much moreserious, and ere long will be the utter ruin of my estate. The sons ofall the chief men among you are pestering my mother to marry themagainst her will. They are afraid to go to her father Icarius,asking him to choose the one he likes best, and to provide marriagegifts for his daughter, but day by day they keep hanging about myfather's house, sacrificing our oxen, sheep, and fat goats for theirbanquets, and never giving so much as a thought to the quantity ofwine they drink. No estate can stand such recklessness; we have now noUlysses to ward off harm from our doors, and I cannot hold my ownagainst them. I shall never all my days be as good a man as he was,still I would indeed defend myself if I had power to do so, for Icannot stand such treatment any longer; my house is being disgracedand ruined. Have respect, therefore, to your own consciences and topublic opinion. Fear, too, the wrath of heaven, lest the gods shouldbe displeased and turn upon you. I pray you by Jove and Themis, who isthe beginning and the end of councils, [do not] hold back, my friends,and leave me singlehanded- unless it be that my brave father Ulyssesdid some wrong to the Achaeans which you would now avenge on me, byaiding and abetting these suitors. Moreover, if I am to be eaten outof house and home at all, I had rather you did the eatingyourselves, for I could then take action against you to somepurpose, and serve you with notices from house to house till I gotpaid in full, whereas now I have no remedy.""

ííííWith this Telemachus dashed his staff to the ground and burst intotears. Every one was very sorry for him, but they all sat still and noone ventured to make him an angry answer, save only Antinous, whospoke thus:

íííí""Telemachus, insolent braggart that you are, how dare you try tothrow the blame upon us suitors? It is your mother's fault not ours,for she is a very artful woman. This three years past, and close onfour, she has been driving us out of our minds, by encouraging eachone of us, and sending him messages without meaning one word of whatshe says. And then there was that other trick she played us. She setup a great tambour frame in her room, and began to work on an enormouspiece of fine needlework. 'Sweet hearts,' said she, 'Ulysses is indeeddead, still do not press me to marry again immediately, wait- for Iwould not have skill in needlework perish unrecorded- till I havecompleted a pall for the hero Laertes, to be in readiness againstthe time when death shall take him. He is very rich, and the womenof the place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.'

íííí""This was what she said, and we assented; whereon we could see herworking on her great web all day long, but at night she would unpickthe stitches again by torchlight. She fooled us in this way forthree years and we never found her out, but as time wore on and shewas now in her fourth year, one of her maids who knew what she wasdoing told us, and we caught her in the act of undoing her work, soshe had to finish it whether she would or no. The suitors,therefore, make you this answer, that both you and the Achaeans mayunderstand-'Send your mother away, and bid her marry the man of herown and of her father's choice'; for I do not know what will happen ifshe goes on plaguing us much longer with the airs she gives herself onthe score of the accomplishments Minerva has taught her, and becauseshe is so clever. We never yet heard of such a woman; we know allabout Tyro, Alcmena, Mycene, and the famous women of old, but theywere nothing to your mother, any one of them. It was not fair of herto treat us in that way, and as long as she continues in the mind withwhich heaven has now endowed her, so long shall we go on eating upyour estate; and I do not see why she should change, for she getsall the honour and glory, and it is you who pay for it, not she.Understand, then, that we will not go back to our lands, neitherhere nor elsewhere, till she has made her choice and married someone or other of us.""

ííííTelemachus answered, ""Antinous, how can I drive the mother whobore me from my father's house? My father is abroad and we do not knowwhether he is alive or dead. It will be hard on me if I have to payIcarius the large sum which I must give him if I insist on sending hisdaughter back to him. Not only will he deal rigorously with me, butheaven will also punish me; for my mother when she leaves the housewill calf on the Erinyes to avenge her; besides, it would not be acreditable thing to do, and I will have nothing to say to it. If youchoose to take offence at this, leave the house and feast elsewhere atone another's houses at your own cost turn and turn about. If, onthe other hand, you elect to persist in spunging upon one man,heaven help me, but Jove shall reckon with you in full, and when youfall in my father's house there shall be no man to avenge you.""

ííííAs he spoke Jove sent two eagles from the top of the mountain, andthey flew on and on with the wind, sailing side by side in their ownlordly flight. When they were right over the middle of the assemblythey wheeled and circled about, beating the air with their wings andglaring death into the eyes of them that were below; then, fightingfiercely and tearing at one another, they flew off towards the rightover the town. The people wondered as they saw them, and asked eachother what an this might be; whereon Halitherses, who was the bestprophet and reader of omens among them, spoke to them plainly and inall honesty, saying:

íííí""Hear me, men of Ithaca, and I speak more particularly to thesuitors, for I see mischief brewing for them. Ulysses is not goingto be away much longer; indeed he is close at hand to deal out deathand destruction, not on them alone, but on many another of us who livein Ithaca. Let us then be wise in time, and put a stop to thiswickedness before he comes. Let the suitors do so of their own accord;it will be better for them, for I am not prophesying without dueknowledge; everything has happened to Ulysses as I foretold when theArgives set out for Troy, and he with them. I said that after goingthrough much hardship and losing all his men he should come home againin the twentieth year and that no one would know him; and now all thisis coming true.""

ííííEurymachus son of Polybus then said, ""Go home, old man, and prophesyto your own children, or it may be worse for them. I can read theseomens myself much better than you can; birds are always flying aboutin the sunshine somewhere or other, but they seldom mean anything.Ulysses has died in a far country, and it is a pity you are not deadalong with him, instead of prating here about omens and adding fuel tothe anger of Telemachus which is fierce enough as it is. I suppose youthink he will give you something for your family, but I tell you-and it shall surely be- when an old man like you, who should knowbetter, talks a young one over till he becomes troublesome, in thefirst place his young friend will only fare so much the worse- he willtake nothing by it, for the suitors will prevent this- and in thenext, we will lay a heavier fine, sir, upon yourself than you willat all like paying, for it will bear hardly upon you. As forTelemachus, I warn him in the presence of you all to send his motherback to her father, who will find her a husband and provide her withall the marriage gifts so dear a daughter may expect. Till we shall goon harassing him with our suit; for we fear no man, and care neitherfor him, with all his fine speeches, nor for any fortune-telling ofyours. You may preach as much as you please, but we shall only hateyou the more. We shall go back and continue to eat up Telemachus'sestate without paying him, till such time as his mother leaves offtormenting us by keeping us day after day on the tiptoe ofexpectation, each vying with the other in his suit for a prize of suchrare perfection. Besides we cannot go after the other women whom weshould marry in due course, but for the way in which she treats us.""

ííííThen Telemachus said, ""Eurymachus, and you other suitors, I shallsay no more, and entreat you no further, for the gods and the peopleof Ithaca now know my story. Give me, then, a ship and a crew oftwenty men to take me hither and thither, and I will go to Spartaand to Pylos in quest of my father who has so long been missing.Some one may tell me something, or (and people often hear things inthis way) some heaven-sent message may direct me. If I can hear of himas alive and on his way home I will put up with the waste yousuitors will make for yet another twelve months. If on the otherhand I hear of his death, I will return at once, celebrate his funeralrites with all due pomp, build a barrow to his memory, and make mymother marry again.""

ííííWith these words he sat down, and Mentor who had been a friend ofUlysses, and had been left in charge of everything with full authorityover the servants, rose to speak. He, then, plainly and in all honestyaddressed them thus:

íííí""Hear me, men of Ithaca, I hope that you may never have a kind andwell-disposed ruler any more, nor one who will govern you equitably; Ihope that all your chiefs henceforward may be cruel and unjust, forthere is not one of you but has forgotten Ulysses, who ruled you asthough he were your father. I am not half so angry with the suitors,for if they choose to do violence in the naughtiness of theirhearts, and wager their heads that Ulysses will not return, they cantake the high hand and eat up his estate, but as for you others I amshocked at the way in which you all sit still without even trying tostop such scandalous goings on-which you could do if you chose, foryou are many and they are few.""

ííííLeiocritus, son of Evenor, answered him saying, ""Mentor, whatfolly is all this, that you should set the people to stay us? It isa hard thing for one man to fight with many about his victuals. Eventhough Ulysses himself were to set upon us while we are feasting inhis house, and do his best to oust us, his wife, who wants him back sovery badly, would have small cause for rejoicing, and his bloodwould be upon his own head if he fought against such great odds. Thereis no sense in what you have been saying. Now, therefore, do youpeople go about your business, and let his father's old friends,Mentor and Halitherses, speed this boy on his journey, if he goes atall- which I do not think he will, for he is more likely to stay wherehe is till some one comes and tells him something.""

ííííOn this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his ownabode, while the suitors returned to the house of Ulysses.

ííííThen Telemachus went all alone by the sea side, washed his handsin the grey waves, and prayed to Minerva.

íííí""Hear me,"" he cried, ""you god who visited me yesterday, and bademe sail the seas in search of my father who has so long beenmissing. I would obey you, but the Achaeans, and more particularly thewicked suitors, are hindering me that I cannot do so.""

ííííAs he thus prayed, Minerva came close up to him in the likenessand with the voice of Mentor. ""Telemachus,"" said she, ""if you are madeof the same stuff as your father you will be neither fool nor cowardhenceforward, for Ulysses never broke his word nor left his workhalf done. If, then, you take after him, your voyage will not befruitless, but unless you have the blood of Ulysses and of Penelope inyour veins I see no likelihood of your succeeding. Sons are seldomas good men as their fathers; they are generally worse, not better;still, as you are not going to be either fool or cowardhenceforward, and are not entirely without some share of your father'swise discernment, I look with hope upon your undertaking. But mind younever make common cause with any of those foolish suitors, for theyhave neither sense nor virtue, and give no thought to death and to thedoom that will shortly fall on one and all of them, so that they shallperish on the same day. As for your voyage, it shall not be longdelayed; your father was such an old friend of mine that I will findyou a ship, and will come with you myself. Now, however, returnhome, and go about among the suitors; begin getting provisions readyfor your voyage; see everything well stowed, the wine in jars, and thebarley meal, which is the staff of life, in leathern bags, while Igo round the town and beat up volunteers at once. There are many shipsin Ithaca both old and new; I will run my eye over them for you andwill choose the best; we will get her ready and will put out to seawithout delay.""

ííííThus spoke Minerva daughter of Jove, and Telemachus lost no timein doing as the goddess told him. He went moodily and found thesuitors flaying goats and singeing pigs in the outer court. Antinouscame up to him at once and laughed as he took his hand in his own,saying, ""Telemachus, my fine fire-eater, bear no more ill bloodneither in word nor deed, but eat and drink with us as you used to do.The Achaeans will find you in everything- a ship and a picked crewto boot- so that you can set sail for Pylos at once and get news ofyour noble father.""

íííí""Antinous,"" answered Telemachus, ""I cannot eat in peace, nor takepleasure of any kind with such men as you are. Was it not enoughthat you should waste so much good property of mine while I was yeta boy? Now that I am older and know more about it, I am also stronger,and whether here among this people, or by going to Pylos, I will doyou all the harm I can. I shall go, and my going will not be in vainthough, thanks to you suitors, I have neither ship nor crew of my own,and must be passenger not captain.""

ííííAs he spoke he snatched his hand from that of Antinous. Meanwhilethe others went on getting dinner ready about the buildings, jeeringat him tauntingly as they did so.

íííí""Telemachus,"" said one youngster, ""means to be the death of us; Isuppose he thinks he can bring friends to help him from Pylos, oragain from Sparta, where he seems bent on going. Or will he go toEphyra as well, for poison to put in our wine and kill us?""

ííííAnother said, ""Perhaps if Telemachus goes on board ship, he willbe like his father and perish far from his friends. In this case weshould have plenty to do, for we could then divide up his propertyamongst us: as for the house we can let his mother and the man whomarries her have that.""

ííííThis was how they talked. But Telemachus went down into the loftyand spacious store-room where his father's treasure of gold and bronzelay heaped up upon the floor, and where the linen and spare clotheswere kept in open chests. Here, too, there was a store of fragrantolive oil, while casks of old, well-ripened wine, unblended and fitfor a god to drink, were ranged against the wall in case Ulyssesshould come home again after all. The room was closed with well-madedoors opening in the middle; moreover the faithful old house-keeperEuryclea, daughter of Ops the son of Pisenor, was in charge ofeverything both night and day. Telemachus called her to the store-roomand said:

íííí""Nurse, draw me off some of the best wine you have, after what youare keeping for my father's own drinking, in case, poor man, he shouldescape death, and find his way home again after all. Let me havetwelve jars, and see that they all have lids; also fill me somewell-sewn leathern bags with barley meal- about twenty measures inall. Get these things put together at once, and say nothing aboutit. I will take everything away this evening as soon as my motherhas gone upstairs for the night. I am going to Sparta and to Pylosto see if I can hear anything about the return of my dear father.

ííííWhen Euryclea heard this she began to cry, and spoke fondly tohim, saying, ""My dear child, what ever can have put such notion asthat into your head? Where in the world do you want to go to- you, whoare the one hope of the house? Your poor father is dead and gone insome foreign country nobody knows where, and as soon as your back isturned these wicked ones here will be scheming to get you put out ofthe way, and will share all your possessions among themselves; staywhere you are among your own people, and do not go wandering andworrying your life out on the barren ocean.""

íííí""Fear not, nurse,"" answered Telemachus, ""my scheme is not withoutheaven's sanction; but swear that you will say nothing about allthis to my mother, till I have been away some ten or twelve days,unless she hears of my having gone, and asks you; for I do not wanther to spoil her beauty by crying.""

ííííThe old woman swore most solemnly that she would not, and when shehad completed her oath, she began drawing off the wine into jars,and getting the barley meal into the bags, while Telemachus wentback to the suitors.

ííííThen Minerva bethought her of another matter. She took his shape,and went round the town to each one of the crew, telling them tomeet at the ship by sundown. She went also to Noemon son ofPhronius, and asked him to let her have a ship- which he was veryready to do. When the sun had set and darkness was over all theland, she got the ship into the water, put all the tackle on board herthat ships generally carry, and stationed her at the end of theharbour. Presently the crew came up, and the goddess spokeencouragingly to each of them.

ííííFurthermore she went to the house of Ulysses, and threw thesuitors into a deep slumber. She caused their drink to fuddle them,and made them drop their cups from their hands, so that instead ofsitting over their wine, they went back into the town to sleep, withtheir eyes heavy and full of drowsiness. Then she took the form andvoice of Mentor, and called Telemachus to come outside.

íííí""Telemachus,"" said she, ""the men are on board and at their oars,waiting for you to give your orders, so make haste and let us be off.""

ííííOn this she led the way, while Telemachus followed in her steps.When they got to the ship they found the crew waiting by the waterside, and Telemachus said, ""Now my men, help me to get the stores onboard; they are all put together in the cloister, and my mother doesnot know anything about it, nor any of the maid servants except one.""

ííííWith these words he led the way and the others followed after.When they had brought the things as he told them, Telemachus went onboard, Minerva going before him and taking her seat in the stern ofthe vessel, while Telemachus sat beside her. Then the men loosed thehawsers and took their places on the benches. Minerva sent them a fairwind from the West, that whistled over the deep blue waves whereonTelemachus told them to catch hold of the ropes and hoist sail, andthey did as he told them. They set the mast in its socket in the crossplank, raised it, and made it fast with the forestays; then theyhoisted their white sails aloft with ropes of twisted ox hide. Asthe sail bellied out with the wind, the ship flew through the deepblue water, and the foam hissed against her bows as she sped onward.Then they made all fast throughout the ship, filled the mixing-bowlsto the brim, and made drink offerings to the immortal gods that arefrom everlasting, but more particularly to the grey-eyed daughter ofJove.

ííííThus, then, the ship sped on her way through the watches of thenight from dark till dawn.

ííííBOOK III.

ííííBUT as the sun was rising from the fair sea into the firmament ofheaven to shed Blight on mortals and immortals, they reached Pylos thecity of Neleus. Now the people of Pylos were gathered on the sea shoreto offer sacrifice of black bulls to Neptune lord of the Earthquake.There were nine guilds with five hundred men in each, and there werenine bulls to each guild. As they were eating the inward meats andburning the thigh bones [on the embers] in the name of Neptune,Telemachus and his crew arrived, furled their sails, brought theirship to anchor, and went ashore.

ííííMinerva led the way and Telemachus followed her. Presently she said,""Telemachus, you must not be in the least shy or nervous; you havetaken this voyage to try and find out where your father is buriedand how he came by his end; so go straight up to Nestor that we maysee what he has got to tell us. Beg of him to speak the truth, andhe will tell no lies, for he is an excellent person.""

íííí""But how, Mentor,"" replied Telemachus, ""dare I go up to Nestor,and how am I to address him? I have never yet been used to holdinglong conversations with people, and am ashamed to begin questioningone who is so much older than myself.""

íííí""Some things, Telemachus,"" answered Minerva, ""will be suggested toyou by your own instinct, and heaven will prompt you further; for I amassured that the gods have been with you from the time of your birthuntil now.""

ííííShe then went quickly on, and Telemachus followed in her stepstill they reached the place where the guilds of the Pylian people wereassembled. There they found Nestor sitting with his sons, while hiscompany round him were busy getting dinner ready, and putting piecesof meat on to the spits while other pieces were cooking. When they sawthe strangers they crowded round them, took them by the hand andbade them take their places. Nestor's son Pisistratus at onceoffered his hand to each of them, and seated them on some softsheepskins that were lying on the sands near his father and hisbrother Thrasymedes. Then he gave them their portions of the inwardmeats and poured wine for them into a golden cup, handing it toMinerva first, and saluting her at the same time.

íííí""Offer a prayer, sir,"" said he, ""to King Neptune, for it is hisfeast that you are joining; when you have duly prayed and made yourdrink-offering, pass the cup to your friend that he may do so also.I doubt not that he too lifts his hands in prayer, for man cannot livewithout God in the world. Still he is younger than you are, and ismuch of an age with myself, so I he handed I will give you theprecedence.""

ííííAs he spoke he handed her the cup. Minerva thought it very right andproper of him to have given it to herself first; she accordingly beganpraying heartily to Neptune. ""O thou,"" she cried, ""that encirclest theearth, vouchsafe to grant the prayers of thy servants that call uponthee. More especially we pray thee send down thy grace on Nestor andon his sons; thereafter also make the rest of the Pylian people somehandsome return for the goodly hecatomb they are offering you. Lastly,grant Telemachus and myself a happy issue, in respect of the matterthat has brought us in our to Pylos.""

ííííWhen she had thus made an end of praying, she handed the cup toTelemachus and he prayed likewise. By and by, when the outer meatswere roasted and had been taken off the spits, the carvers gaveevery man his portion and they all made an excellent dinner. As soonas they had had enough to eat and drink, Nestor, knight of Gerene,began to speak.

íííí""Now,"" said he, ""that our guests have done their dinner, it willbe best to ask them who they are. Who, then, sir strangers, are you,and from what port have you sailed? Are you traders? or do you sailthe seas as rovers with your hand against every man, and every man'shand against you?""

ííííTelemachus answered boldly, for Minerva had given him courage to askabout his father and get himself a good name.

íííí""Nestor,"" said he, ""son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean name, youask whence we come, and I will tell you. We come from Ithaca underNeritum, and the matter about which I would speak is of private notpublic import. I seek news of my unhappy father Ulysses, who is saidto have sacked the town of Troy in company with yourself. We know whatfate befell each one of the other heroes who fought at Troy, but asregards Ulysses heaven has hidden from us the knowledge even that heis dead at all, for no one can certify us in what place he perished,nor say whether he fell in battle on the mainland, or was lost atsea amid the waves of Amphitrite. Therefore I am suppliant at yourknees, if haply you may be pleased to tell me of his melancholy end,whether you saw it with your own eyes, or heard it from some othertraveller, for he was a man born to trouble. Do not soften thingsout of any pity for me, but tell me in all plainness exactly whatyou saw. If my brave father Ulysses ever did you loyal service, eitherby word or deed, when you Achaeans were harassed among the Trojans,bear it in mind now as in my favour and tell me truly all.""

íííí""My friend,"" answered Nestor, ""you recall a time of much sorrow tomy mind, for the brave Achaeans suffered much both at sea, whileprivateering under Achilles, and when fighting before the great cityof king Priam. Our best men all of them fell there- Ajax, Achilles,Patroclus peer of gods in counsel, and my own dear son Antilochus, aman singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant. But we sufferedmuch more than this; what mortal tongue indeed could tell the wholestory? Though you were to stay here and question me for five years, oreven six, I could not tell you all that the Achaeans suffered, and youwould turn homeward weary of my tale before it ended. Nine longyears did we try every kind of stratagem, but the hand of heaven wasagainst us; during all this time there was no one who could comparewith your father in subtlety- if indeed you are his son- I canhardly believe my eyes- and you talk just like him too- no one wouldsay that people of such different ages could speak so much alike. Heand I never had any kind of difference from first to last neither incamp nor council, but in singleness of heart and purpose we advisedthe Argives how all might be ordered for the best.

íííí""When however, we had sacked the city of Priam, and were settingsail in our ships as heaven had dispersed us, then Jove saw fit to vexthe Argives on their homeward voyage; for they had Not all been eitherwise or understanding, and hence many came to a bad end through thedispleasure of Jove's daughter Minerva, who brought about a quarrelbetween the two sons of Atreus.

íííí""The sons of Atreus called a meeting which was not as it shouldbe, for it was sunset and the Achaeans were heavy with wine. When theyexplained why they had called- the people together, it seemed thatMenelaus was for sailing homeward at once, and this displeasedAgamemnon, who thought that we should wait till we had offeredhecatombs to appease the anger of Minerva. Fool that he was, hemight have known that he would not prevail with her, for when the godshave made up their minds they do not change them lightly. So the twostood bandying hard words, whereon the Achaeans sprang to their feetwith a cry that rent the air, and were of two minds as to what theyshould do.

íííí""That night we rested and nursed our anger, for Jove was hatchingmischief against us. But in the morning some of us drew our ships intothe water and put our goods with our women on board, while the rest,about half in number, stayed behind with Agamemnon. We- the otherhalf- embarked and sailed; and the ships went well, for heaven hadsmoothed the sea. When we reached Tenedos we offered sacrifices to thegods, for we were longing to get home; cruel Jove, however, did notyet mean that we should do so, and raised a second quarrel in thecourse of which some among us turned their ships back again, andsailed away under Ulysses to make their peace with Agamemnon; but I,and all the ships that were with me pressed forward, for I saw thatmischief was brewing. The son of Tydeus went on also with me, andhis crews with him. Later on Menelaus joined us at Lesbos, and foundus making up our minds about our course- for we did not know whetherto go outside Chios by the island of Psyra, keeping this to ourleft, or inside Chios, over against the stormy headland of Mimas. Sowe asked heaven for a sign, and were shown one to the effect that weshould be soonest out of danger if we headed our ships across the opensea to Euboea. This we therefore did, and a fair wind sprang upwhich gave us a quick passage during the night to Geraestus, wherewe offered many sacrifices to Neptune for having helped us so far onour way. Four days later Diomed and his men stationed their ships inArgos, but I held on for Pylos, and the wind never fell light from theday when heaven first made it fair for me.

íííí""Therefore, my dear young friend, I returned without hearinganything about the others. I know neither who got home safely norwho were lost but, as in duty bound, I will give you without reservethe reports that have reached me since I have been here in my ownhouse. They say the Myrmidons returned home safely under Achilles' sonNeoptolemus; so also did the valiant son of Poias, Philoctetes.Idomeneus, again, lost no men at sea, and all his followers whoescaped death in the field got safe home with him to Crete. Nomatter how far out of the world you live, you will have heard ofAgamemnon and the bad end he came to at the hands of Aegisthus- anda fearful reckoning did Aegisthus presently pay. See what a good thingit is for a man to leave a son behind him to do as Orestes did, whokilled false Aegisthus the murderer of his noble father. You too,then- for you are a tall, smart-looking fellow- show your mettle andmake yourself a name in story.""

íííí""Nestor son of Neleus,"" answered Telemachus, ""honour to theAchaean name, the Achaeans applaud Orestes and his name will livethrough all time for he has avenged his father nobly. Would thatheaven might grant me to do like vengeance on the insolence of thewicked suitors, who are ill treating me and plotting my ruin; butthe gods have no such happiness in store for me and for my father,so we must bear it as best we may.""

íííí""My friend,"" said Nestor, ""now that you remind me, I remember tohave heard that your mother has many suitors, who are ill disposedtowards you and are making havoc of your estate. Do you submit to thistamely, or are public feeling and the voice of heaven against you? Whoknows but what Ulysses may come back after all, and pay thesescoundrels in full, either single-handed or with a force of Achaeansbehind him? If Minerva were to take as great a liking to you as shedid to Ulysses when we were fighting before Troy (for I never yetsaw the gods so openly fond of any one as Minerva then was of yourfather), if she would take as good care of you as she did of him,these wooers would soon some of them him, forget their wooing.""

ííííTelemachus answered, ""I can expect nothing of the kind; it wouldbe far too much to hope for. I dare not let myself think of it. Eventhough the gods themselves willed it no such good fortune could befallme.""

ííííOn this Minerva said, ""Telemachus, what are you talking about?Heaven has a long arm if it is minded to save a man; and if it wereme, I should not care how much I suffered before getting home,provided I could be safe when I was once there. I would rather this,than get home quickly, and then be killed in my own house as Agamemnonwas by the treachery of Aegisthus and his wife. Still, death iscertain, and when a man's hour is come, not even the gods can savehim, no matter how fond they are of him.""

íííí""Mentor,"" answered Telemachus, ""do not let us talk about it anymore. There is no chance of my father's ever coming back; the godshave long since counselled his destruction. There is something else,however, about which I should like to ask Nestor, for he knows muchmore than any one else does. They say he has reigned for threegenerations so that it is like talking to an immortal. Tell me,therefore, Nestor, and tell me true; how did Agamemnon come to diein that way? What was Menelaus doing? And how came false Aegisthusto kill so far better a man than himself? Was Menelaus away fromAchaean Argos, voyaging elsewhither among mankind, that Aegisthus tookheart and killed Agamemnon?""

íííí""I will tell you truly,"" answered Nestor, ""and indeed you haveyourself divined how it all happened. If Menelaus when he got backfrom Troy had found Aegisthus still alive in his house, there wouldhave been no barrow heaped up for him, not even when he was dead,but he would have been thrown outside the city to dogs and vultures,and not a woman would have mourned him, for he had done a deed ofgreat wickedness; but we were over there, fighting hard at Troy, andAegisthus who was taking his ease quietly in the heart of Argos,cajoled Agamemnon's wife Clytemnestra with incessant flattery.

íííí""At first she would have nothing to do with his wicked scheme, forshe was of a good natural disposition; moreover there was a bardwith her, to whom Agamemnon had given strict orders on setting out forTroy, that he was to keep guard over his wife; but when heaven hadcounselled her destruction, Aegisthus thus this bard off to a desertisland and left him there for crows and seagulls to batten upon- afterwhich she went willingly enough to the house of Aegisthus. Then heoffered many burnt sacrifices to the gods, and decorated manytemples with tapestries and gilding, for he had succeeded far beyondhis expectations.

íííí""Meanwhile Menelaus and I were on our way home from Troy, on goodterms with one another. When we got to Sunium, which is the point ofAthens, Apollo with his painless shafts killed Phrontis thesteersman of Menelaus' ship (and never man knew better how to handle avessel in rough weather) so that he died then and there with thehelm in his hand, and Menelaus, though very anxious to pressforward, had to wait in order to bury his comrade and give him his duefuneral rites. Presently, when he too could put to sea again, andhad sailed on as far as the Malean heads, Jove counselled evil againsthim and made it it blow hard till the waves ran mountains high. Herehe divided his fleet and took the one half towards Crete where theCydonians dwell round about the waters of the river Iardanus. There isa high headland hereabouts stretching out into the sea from a placecalled Gortyn, and all along this part of the coast as far as Phaestusthe sea runs high when there is a south wind blowing, but arterPhaestus the coast is more protected, for a small headland can makea great shelter. Here this part of the fleet was driven on to therocks and wrecked; but the crews just managed to save themselves. Asfor the other five ships, they were taken by winds and seas toEgypt, where Menelaus gathered much gold and substance among people ofan alien speech. Meanwhile Aegisthus here at home plotted his evildeed. For seven years after he had killed Agamemnon he ruled inMycene, and the people were obedient under him, but in the eighth yearOrestes came back from Athens to be his bane, and killed themurderer of his father. Then he celebrated the funeral rites of hismother and of false Aegisthus by a banquet to the people of Argos, andon that very day Menelaus came home, with as much treasure as hisships could carry.

íííí""Take my advice then, and do not go travelling about for long so farfrom home, nor leave your property with such dangerous people inyour house; they will eat up everything you have among them, and youwill have been on a fool's errand. Still, I should advise you by allmeans to go and visit Menelaus, who has lately come off a voyage amongsuch distant peoples as no man could ever hope to get back from,when the winds had once carried him so far out of his reckoning;even birds cannot fly the distance in a twelvemonth, so vast andterrible are the seas that they must cross. Go to him, therefore, bysea, and take your own men with you; or if you would rather travelby land you can have a chariot, you can have horses, and here are mysons who can escort you to Lacedaemon where Menelaus lives. Beg of himto speak the truth, and he will tell you no lies, for he is anexcellent person.""

ííííAs he spoke the sun set and it came on dark, whereon Minerva said,""Sir, all that you have said is well; now, however, order thetongues of the victims to be cut, and mix wine that we may makedrink-offerings to Neptune, and the other immortals, and then go tobed, for it is bed time. People should go away early and not keep latehours at a religious festival.""

ííííThus spoke the daughter of Jove, and they obeyed her saying. Menservants poured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filledthe mixing-bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after givingevery man his drink-offering; then they threw the tongues of thevictims into the fire, and stood up to make their drink-offerings.When they had made their offerings and had drunk each as much as hewas minded, Minerva and Telemachus were forgoing on board theirship, but Nestor caught them up at once and stayed them.

íííí""Heaven and the immortal gods,"" he exclaimed, ""forbid that youshould leave my house to go on board of a ship. Do you think I am sopoor and short of clothes, or that I have so few cloaks and as to beunable to find comfortable beds both for myself and for my guests? Letme tell you I have store both of rugs and cloaks, and shall not permitthe son of my old friend Ulysses to camp down on the deck of a ship-not while I live- nor yet will my sons after me, but they will keepopen house as have done.""

ííííThen Minerva answered, ""Sir, you have spoken well, and it will bemuch better that Telemachus should do as you have said; he, therefore,shall return with you and sleep at your house, but I must go back togive orders to my crew, and keep them in good heart. I am the onlyolder person among them; the rest are all young men of Telemachus' ownage, who have taken this voyage out of friendship; so I must return tothe ship and sleep there. Moreover to-morrow I must go to theCauconians where I have a large sum of money long owing to me. Asfor Telemachus, now that he is your guest, send him to Lacedaemon in achariot, and let one of your sons go with him. Be pleased also toprovide him with your best and fleetest horses.""

ííííWhen she had thus spoken, she flew away in the form of an eagle, andall marvelled as they beheld it. Nestor was astonished, and tookTelemachus by the hand. ""My friend,"" said he, ""I see that you aregoing to be a great hero some day, since the gods wait upon you thuswhile you are still so young. This can have been none other of thosewho dwell in heaven than Jove's redoubtable daughter, theTrito-born, who showed such favour towards your brave father among theArgives."" ""Holy queen,"" he continued, ""vouchsafe to send down thygrace upon myself, my good wife, and my children. In return, I willoffer you in sacrifice a broad-browed heifer of a year old,unbroken, and never yet brought by man under the yoke. I will gild herhorns, and will offer her up to you in sacrifice.""

ííííThus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer. He then led theway to his own house, followed by his sons and sons-in-law. Whenthey had got there and had taken their places on the benches andseats, he mixed them a bowl of sweet wine that was eleven years oldwhen the housekeeper took the lid off the jar that held it. As hemixed the wine, he prayed much and made drink-offerings to Minerva,daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove. Then, when they had made theirdrink-offerings and had drunk each as much as he was minded, theothers went home to bed each in his own abode; but Nestor putTelemachus to sleep in the room that was over the gateway along withPisistratus, who was the only unmarried son now left him. As forhimself, he slept in an inner room of the house, with the queen hiswife by his side.

ííííNow when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared,Nestor left his couch and took his seat on the benches of white andpolished marble that stood in front of his house. Here aforetime satNeleus, peer of gods in counsel, but he was now dead, and had goneto the house of Hades; so Nestor sat in his seat, sceptre in hand,as guardian of the public weal. His sons as they left their roomsgathered round him, Echephron, Stratius, Perseus, Aretus, andThrasymedes; the sixth son was Pisistratus, and when Telemachus joinedthem they made him sit with them. Nestor then addressed them.

íííí""My sons,"" said he, ""make haste to do as I shall bid you. I wishfirst and foremost to propitiate the great goddess Minerva, whomanifested herself visibly to me during yesterday's festivities. Go,then, one or other of you to the plain, tell the stockman to look meout a heifer, and come on here with it at once. Another must go toTelemachus's ship, and invite all the crew, leaving two men only incharge of the vessel. Some one else will run and fetch Laerceus thegoldsmith to gild the horns of the heifer. The rest, stay all of youwhere you are; tell the maids in the house to prepare an excellentdinner, and to fetch seats, and logs of wood for a burnt offering.Tell them also- to bring me some clear spring water.""

ííííOn this they hurried off on their several errands. The heifer wasbrought in from the plain, and Telemachus's crew came from the ship;the goldsmith brought the anvil, hammer, and tongs, with which heworked his gold, and Minerva herself came to the sacrifice. Nestorgave out the gold, and the smith gilded the horns of the heifer thatthe goddess might have pleasure in their beauty. Then Stratius andEchephron brought her in by the horns; Aretus fetched water from thehouse in a ewer that had a flower pattern on it, and in his other handhe held a basket of barley meal; sturdy Thrasymedes stood by with asharp axe, ready to strike the heifer, while Perseus held a bucket.Then Nestor began with washing his hands and sprinkling the barleymeal, and he offered many a prayer to Minerva as he threw a lockfrom the heifer's head upon the fire.

ííííWhen they had done praying and sprinkling the barley mealThrasymedes dealt his blow, and brought the heifer down with astroke that cut through the tendons at the base of her neck, whereonthe daughters and daughters-in-law of Nestor, and his venerable wifeEurydice (she was eldest daughter to Clymenus) screamed withdelight. Then they lifted the heifer's head from off the ground, andPisistratus cut her throat. When she had done bleeding and was quitedead, they cut her up. They cut out the thigh bones all in due course,wrapped them round in two layers of fat, and set some pieces of rawmeat on the top of them; then Nestor laid them upon the wood fireand poured wine over them, while the young men stood near him withfive-pronged spits in their hands. When the thighs were burned andthey had tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest of the meat upsmall, put the pieces on the spits and toasted them over the fire.

ííííMeanwhile lovely Polycaste, Nestor's youngest daughter, washedTelemachus. When she had washed him and anointed him with oil, shebrought him a fair mantle and shirt, and he looked like a god as hecame from the bath and took his seat by the side of Nestor. When theouter meats were done they drew them off the spits and sat down todinner where they were waited upon by some worthy henchmen, who keptpouring them out their wine in cups of gold. As soon as they had hadhad enough to eat and drink Nestor said, ""Sons, put Telemachus'shorses to the chariot that he may start at once.""

ííííThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said, and yoked thefleet horses to the chariot. The housekeeper packed them up aprovision of bread, wine, and sweetmeats fit for the sons ofprinces. Then Telemachus got into the chariot, while Pisistratusgathered up the reins and took his seat beside him. He lashed thehorses on and they flew forward nothing loth into the open country,leaving the high citadel of Pylos behind them. All that day did theytravel, swaying the yoke upon their necks till the sun went down anddarkness was over all the land. Then they reached Pherae where Diocleslived, who was son to Ortilochus and grandson to Alpheus. Here theypassed the night and Diocles entertained them hospitably. When thechild of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn; appeared, they again yoked theirhorses and drove out through the gateway under the echoinggatehouse. Pisistratus lashed the horses on and they flew forwardnothing loth; presently they came to the corn lands Of the opencountry, and in the course of time completed their journey, so welldid their steeds take them.

ííííNow when the sun had set and darkness was over the land.

ííííBOOK IV.

ííííTHEY reached the low lying city of Lacedaemon them where theydrove straight to the of abode Menelaus [and found him in his ownhouse, feasting with his many clansmen in honour of the wedding of hisson, and also of his daughter, whom he was marrying to the son of thatvaliant warrior Achilles. He had given his consent and promised her tohim while he was still at Troy, and now the gods were bringing themarriage about; so he was sending her with chariots and horses tothe city of the Myrmidons over whom Achilles' son was reigning. Forhis only son he had found a bride from Sparta, daughter of Alector.This son, Megapenthes, was born to him of a bondwoman, for heavenvouchsafed Helen no more children after she had borne Hermione, whowas fair as golden Venus herself.

ííííSo the neighbours and kinsmen of Menelaus were feasting and makingmerry in his house. There was a bard also to sing to them and play hislyre, while two tumblers went about performing in the midst of themwhen the man struck up with his tune.]

ííííTelemachus and the son of Nestor stayed their horses at the gate,whereon Eteoneus servant to Menelaus came out, and as soon as he sawthem ran hurrying back into the house to tell his Master. He wentclose up to him and said, ""Menelaus, there are some strangers comehere, two men, who look like sons of Jove. What are we to do? Shall wetake their horses out, or tell them to find friends elsewhere asthey best can?""

ííííMenelaus was very angry and said, ""Eteoneus, son of Boethous, younever used to be a fool, but now you talk like a simpleton. Take theirhorses out, of course, and show the strangers in that they may havesupper; you and I have stayed often enough at other people's housesbefore we got back here, where heaven grant that we may rest inpeace henceforward.""

ííííSo Eteoneus bustled back and bade other servants come with him. Theytook their sweating hands from under the yoke, made them fast to themangers, and gave them a feed of oats and barley mixed. Then theyleaned the chariot against the end wall of the courtyard, and ledthe way into the house. Telemachus and Pisistratus were astonishedwhen they saw it, for its splendour was as that of the sun and moon;then, when they had admired everything to their heart's content,they went into the bath room and washed themselves.

ííííWhen the servants had washed them and anointed them with oil, theybrought them woollen cloaks and shirts, and the two took their seatsby the side of Menelaus. A maidservant brought them water in abeautiful golden ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for them towash their hands; and she drew a clean table beside them. An upperservant brought them bread, and offered them many good things ofwhat there was in the house, while the carver fetched them plates ofall manner of meats and set cups of gold by their side.

ííííMenelaus then greeted them saying, ""Fall to, and welcome; when youhave done supper I shall ask who you are, for the lineage of suchmen as you cannot have been lost. You must be descended from a line ofsceptre-bearing kings, for poor people do not have such sons as youare.""

ííííOn this he handed them a piece of fat roast loin, which had been setnear him as being a prime part, and they laid their hands on thegood things that were before them; as soon as they had had enough toeat and drink, Telemachus said to the son of Nestor, with his headso close that no one might hear, ""Look, Pisistratus, man after myown heart, see the gleam of bronze and gold- of amber, ivory, andsilver. Everything is so splendid that it is like seeing the palace ofOlympian Jove. I am lost in admiration.""

ííííMenelaus overheard him and said, ""No one, my sons, can hold hisown with Jove, for his house and everything about him is immortal; butamong mortal men- well, there may be another who has as much wealth asI have, or there may not; but at all events I have travelled muchand have undergone much hardship, for it was nearly eight years beforeI could get home with my fleet. I went to Cyprus, Phoenicia and theEgyptians; I went also to the Ethiopians, the Sidonians, and theErembians, and to Libya where the lambs have horns as soon as they areborn, and the sheep lamb down three times a year. Every one in thatcountry, whether master or man, has plenty of cheese, meat, and goodmilk, for the ewes yield all the year round. But while I wastravelling and getting great riches among these people, my brother wassecretly and shockingly murdered through the perfidy of his wickedwife, so that I have no pleasure in being lord of all this wealth.Whoever your parents may be they must have told you about all this,and of my heavy loss in the ruin of a stately mansion fully andmagnificently furnished. Would that I had only a third of what I nowhave so that I had stayed at home, and all those were living whoperished on the plain of Troy, far from Argos. I of grieve, as I sithere in my house, for one and all of them. At times I cry aloud forsorrow, but presently I leave off again, for crying is cold comfortand one soon tires of it. Yet grieve for these as I may, I do so forone man more than for them all. I cannot even think of him withoutloathing both food and sleep, so miserable does he make me, for no oneof all the Achaeans worked so hard or risked so much as he did. Hetook nothing by it, and has left a legacy of sorrow to myself, forhe has been gone a long time, and we know not whether he is alive ordead. His old father, his long-suffering wife Penelope, and his sonTelemachus, whom he left behind him an infant in arms, are plungedin grief on his account.""

ííííThus spoke Menelaus, and the heart of Telemachus yearned as hebethought him of his father. Tears fell from his eyes as he heardhim thus mentioned, so that he held his cloak before his face withboth hands. When Menelaus saw this he doubted whether to let himchoose his own time for speaking, or to ask him at once and findwhat it was all about.

ííííWhile he was thus in two minds Helen came down from her high vaultedand perfumed room, looking as lovely as Diana herself. Adraste broughther a seat, Alcippe a soft woollen rug while Phylo fetched her thesilver work-box which Alcandra wife of Polybus had given her.Polybus lived in Egyptian Thebes, which is the richest city in thewhole world; he gave Menelaus two baths, both of pure silver, twotripods, and ten talents of gold; besides all this, his wife gaveHelen some beautiful presents, to wit, a golden distaff, and asilver work-box that ran on wheels, with a gold band round the topof it. Phylo now placed this by her side, full of fine spun yarn,and a distaff charged with violet coloured wool was laid upon thetop of it. Then Helen took her seat, put her feet upon thefootstool, and began to question her husband.

íííí""Do we know, Menelaus,"" said she, ""the names of these strangerswho have come to visit us? Shall I guess right or wrong?-but Icannot help saying what I think. Never yet have I seen either man orwoman so like somebody else (indeed when I look at him I hardly knowwhat to think) as this young man is like Telemachus, whom Ulysses leftas a baby behind him, when you Achaeans went to Troy with battle inyour hearts, on account of my most shameless self.""

íííí""My dear wife,"" replied Menelaus, ""I see the likeness just as youdo. His hands and feet are just like Ulysses'; so is his hair, withthe shape of his head and the expression of his eyes. Moreover, when Iwas talking about Ulysses, and saying how much he had suffered on myaccount, tears fell from his eyes, and he hid his face in his mantle.""

ííííThen Pisistratus said, ""Menelaus, son of Atreus, you are right inthinking that this young man is Telemachus, but he is very modest, andis ashamed to come here and begin opening up discourse with onewhose conversation is so divinely interesting as your own. Myfather, Nestor, sent me to escort him hither, for he wanted to knowwhether you could give him any counsel or suggestion. A son has alwaystrouble at home when his father has gone away leaving him withoutsupporters; and this is how Telemachus is now placed, for his fatheris absent, and there is no one among his own people to stand by him.""

íííí""Bless my heart,"" replied Menelaus, ""then I am receiving a visitfrom the son of a very dear friend, who suffered much hardship formy sake. I had always hoped to entertain him with most markeddistinction when heaven had granted us a safe return from beyond theseas. I should have founded a city for him in Argos, and built him ahouse. I should have made him leave Ithaca with his goods, his son,and all his people, and should have sacked for them some one of theneighbouring cities that are subject to me. We should thus have seenone another continually, and nothing but death could haveinterrupted so close and happy an intercourse. I suppose, however,that heaven grudged us such great good fortune, for it has preventedthe poor fellow from ever getting home at all.""

ííííThus did he speak, and his words set them all a weeping. Helen wept,Telemachus wept, and so did Menelaus, nor could Pisistratus keep hiseyes from filling, when he remembered his dear brother Antilochus whomthe son of bright Dawn had killed. Thereon he said to Menelaus,

íííí""Sir, my father Nestor, when we used to talk about you at home, toldme you were a person of rare and excellent understanding. If, then, itbe possible, do as I would urge you. I am not fond of crying while Iam getting my supper. Morning will come in due course, and in theforenoon I care not how much I cry for those that are dead and gone.This is all we can do for the poor things. We can only shave our headsfor them and wring the tears from our cheeks. I had a brother who diedat Troy; he was by no means the worst man there; you are sure tohave known him- his name was Antilochus; I never set eyes upon himmyself, but they say that he was singularly fleet of foot and in fightvaliant.""

íííí""Your discretion, my friend,"" answered Menelaus, ""is beyond youryears. It is plain you take after your father. One can soon see when aman is son to one whom heaven has blessed both as regards wife andoffspring- and it has blessed Nestor from first to last all hisdays, giving him a green old age in his own house, with sons about himwho are both we disposed and valiant. We will put an end thereforeto all this weeping, and attend to our supper again. Let water bepoured over our hands. Telemachus and I can talk with one anotherfully in the morning.""

ííííOn this Asphalion, one of the servants, poured water over theirhands and they laid their hands on the good things that were beforethem.

ííííThen Jove's daughter Helen bethought her of another matter. Shedrugged the wine with an herb that banishes all care, sorrow, andill humour. Whoever drinks wine thus drugged cannot shed a single tearall the rest of the day, not even though his father and mother both ofthem drop down dead, or he sees a brother or a son hewn in piecesbefore his very eyes. This drug, of such sovereign power and virtue,had been given to Helen by Polydamna wife of Thon, a woman of Egypt,where there grow all sorts of herbs, some good to put into themixing-bowl and others poisonous. Moreover, every one in the wholecountry is a skilled physician, for they are of the race of Paeeon.When Helen had put this drug in the bowl, and had told the servants toserve the wine round, she said:

íííí""Menelaus, son of Atreus, and you my good friends, sons ofhonourable men (which is as Jove wills, for he is the giver both ofgood and evil, and can do what he chooses), feast here as you will,and listen while I tell you a tale in season. I cannot indeed nameevery single one of the exploits of Ulysses, but I can say what he didwhen he was before Troy, and you Achaeans were in all sorts ofdifficulties. He covered himself with wounds and bruises, dressedhimself all in rags, and entered the enemy's city looking like amenial or a beggar. and quite different from what he did when he wasamong his own people. In this disguise he entered the city of Troy,and no one said anything to him. I alone recognized him and began toquestion him, but he was too cunning for me. When, however, I hadwashed and anointed him and had given him clothes, and after I hadsworn a solemn oath not to betray him to the Trojans till he had gotsafely back to his own camp and to the ships, he told me all thatthe Achaeans meant to do. He killed many Trojans and got muchinformation before he reached the Argive camp, for all which thingsthe Trojan women made lamentation, but for my own part I was glad, formy heart was beginning to oam after my home, and I was unhappy aboutwrong that Venus had done me in taking me over there, away from mycountry, my girl, and my lawful wedded husband, who is indeed by nomeans deficient either in person or understanding.""

ííííThen Menelaus said, ""All that you have been saying, my dear wife, istrue. I have travelled much, and have had much to do with heroes,but I have never seen such another man as Ulysses. What endurance too,and what courage he displayed within the wooden horse, wherein all thebravest of the Argives were lying in wait to bring death anddestruction upon the Trojans. At that moment you came up to us; somegod who wished well to the Trojans must have set you on to it andyou had Deiphobus with you. Three times did you go all round ourhiding place and pat it; you called our chiefs each by his own name,and mimicked all our wives -Diomed, Ulysses, and I from our seatsinside heard what a noise you made. Diomed and I could not make up ourminds whether to spring out then and there, or to answer you frominside, but Ulysses held us all in check, so we sat quite still, allexcept Anticlus, who was beginning to answer you, when Ulysses clappedhis two brawny hands over his mouth, and kept them there. It wasthis that saved us all, for he muzzled Anticlus till Minerva tookyou away again.""

íííí""How sad,"" exclaimed Telemachus, ""that all this was of no avail tosave him, nor yet his own iron courage. But now, sir, be pleased tosend us all to bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon ofsleep.""

ííííOn this Helen told the maid servants to set beds in the room thatwas in the gatehouse, and to make them with good red rugs, andspread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for the gueststo wear. So the maids went out, carrying a torch, and made the beds,to which a man-servant presently conducted the strangers. Thus,then, did Telemachus and Pisistratus sleep there in the forecourt,while the son of Atreus lay in an inner room with lovely Helen byhis side.

ííííWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Menelausrose and dressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his comelyfeet, girded his sword about his shoulders, and left his roomlooking like an immortal god. Then, taking a seat near Telemachus hesaid:

íííí""And what, Telemachus, has led you to take this long sea voyage toLacedaemon? Are you on public or private business? Tell me all aboutit.""

íííí""I have come, sir replied Telemachus, ""to see if you can tell meanything about my father. I am being eaten out of house and home; myfair estate is being wasted, and my house is full of miscreants whokeep killing great numbers of my sheep and oxen, on the pretence ofpaying their addresses to my mother. Therefore, I am suppliant at yourknees if haply you may tell me about my father's melancholy end,whether you saw it with your own eyes, or heard it from some othertraveller; for he was a man born to trouble. Do not soften thingsout of any pity for myself, but tell me in all plainness exactlywhat you saw. If my brave father Ulysses ever did you loyal serviceeither by word or deed, when you Achaeans were harassed by theTrojans, bear it in mind now as in my favour and tell me truly all.""

ííííMenelaus on hearing this was very much shocked. ""So,"" heexclaimed, ""these cowards would usurp a brave man's bed? A hindmight as well lay her new born young in the lair of a lion, and thengo off to feed in the forest or in some grassy dell: the lion whenhe comes back to his lair will make short work with the pair ofthem- and so will Ulysses with these suitors. By father Jove, Minerva,and Apollo, if Ulysses is still the man that he was when he wrestledwith Philomeleides in Lesbos, and threw him so heavily that all theAchaeans cheered him- if he is still such and were to come nearthese suitors, they would have a short shrift and a sorry wedding.As regards your questions, however, I will not prevaricate nor deceiveyou, but will tell you without concealment all that the old man of thesea told me.

íííí""I was trying to come on here, but the gods detained me in Egypt,for my hecatombs had not given them full satisfaction, and the godsare very strict about having their dues. Now off Egypt, about as faras a ship can sail in a day with a good stiff breeze behind her, thereis an island called Pharos- it has a good harbour from which vesselscan get out into open sea when they have taken in water- and thegods becalmed me twenty days without so much as a breath of fairwind to help me forward. We should have run clean out of provisionsand my men would have starved, if a goddess had not taken pity upon meand saved me in the person of Idothea, daughter to Proteus, the oldman of the sea, for she had taken a great fancy to me.

íííí""She came to me one day when I was by myself, as I often was, forthe men used to go with their barbed hooks, all over the island in thehope of catching a fish or two to save them from the pangs ofhunger. 'Stranger,' said she, 'it seems to me that you like starvingin this way- at any rate it does not greatly trouble you, for youstick here day after day, without even trying to get away thoughyour men are dying by inches.'

íííí""'Let me tell you,' said I, 'whichever of the goddesses you mayhappen to be, that I am not staying here of my own accord, but musthave offended the gods that live in heaven. Tell me, therefore, forthe gods know everything. which of the immortals it is that ishindering me in this way, and tell me also how I may sail the sea soas to reach my home.'

íííí""'Stranger,' replied she, 'I will make it all quite clear to you.There is an old immortal who lives under the sea hereabouts andwhose name is Proteus. He is an Egyptian, and people say he is myfather; he is Neptune's head man and knows every inch of ground allover the bottom of the sea. If you can snare him and hold him tight,he will tell you about your voyage, what courses you are to take,and how you are to sail the sea so as to reach your home. He will alsotell you, if you so will, all that has been going on at your houseboth good and bad, while you have been away on your long and dangerousjourney.'

íííí""'Can you show me,' said I, 'some stratagem by means of which Imay catch this old god without his suspecting it and finding me out?For a god is not easily caught- not by a mortal man.'

íííí""'Stranger,' said she, 'I will make it all quite clear to you. Aboutthe time when the sun shall have reached mid heaven, the old man ofthe sea comes up from under the waves, heralded by the West windthat furs the water over his head. As soon as he has come up he liesdown, and goes to sleep in a great sea cave, where the seals-Halosydne's chickens as they call them- come up also from the greysea, and go to sleep in shoals all round him; and a very strong andfish-like smell do they bring with them. Early to-morrow morning Iwill take you to this place and will lay you in ambush. Pick out,therefore, the three best men you have in your fleet, and I willtell you all the tricks that the old man will play you.

íííí""'First he will look over all his seals, and count them; then,when he has seen them and tallied them on his five fingers, he will goto sleep among them, as a shepherd among his sheep. The moment you seethat he is asleep seize him; put forth all your strength and holdhim fast, for he will do his very utmost to get away from you. He willturn himself into every kind of creature that goes upon the earth, andwill become also both fire and water; but you must hold him fast andgrip him tighter and tighter, till he begins to talk to you andcomes back to what he was when you saw him go to sleep; then you mayslacken your hold and let him go; and you can ask him which of thegods it is that is angry with you, and what you must do to reachyour home over the seas.'

íííí""Having so said she dived under the waves, whereon I turned backto the place where my ships were ranged upon the shore; and my heartwas clouded with care as I went along. When I reached my ship we gotsupper ready, for night was falling, and camped down upon the beach.

íííí""When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I took thethree men on whose prowess of all kinds I could most rely, and wentalong by the sea-side, praying heartily to heaven. Meanwhile thegoddess fetched me up four seal skins from the bottom of the sea,all of them just skinned, for she meant playing a trick upon herfather. Then she dug four pits for us to lie in, and sat down towait till we should come up. When we were close to her, she made uslie down in the pits one after the other, and threw a seal skin overeach of us. Our ambuscade would have been intolerable, for thestench of the fishy seals was most distressing- who would go to bedwith a sea monster if he could help it?-but here, too, the goddesshelped us, and thought of something that gave us great relief, for sheput some ambrosia under each man's nostrils, which was so fragrantthat it killed the smell of the seals.

íííí""We waited the whole morning and made the best of it, watching theseals come up in hundreds to bask upon the sea shore, till at noon theold man of the sea came up too, and when he had found his fat seals hewent over them and counted them. We were among the first he counted,and he never suspected any guile, but laid himself down to sleep assoon as he had done counting. Then we rushed upon him with a shout andseized him; on which he began at once with his old tricks, and changedhimself first into a lion with a great mane; then all of a sudden hebecame a dragon, a leopard, a wild boar; the next moment he wasrunning water, and then again directly he was a tree, but we stuckto him and never lost hold, till at last the cunning old creaturebecame distressed, and said, Which of the gods was it, Son ofAtreus, that hatched this plot with you for snaring me and seizingme against my will? What do you want?'

íííí""'You know that yourself, old man,' I answered, 'you will gainnothing by trying to put me off. It is because I have been kept solong in this island, and see no sign of my being able to get away. Iam losing all heart; tell me, then, for you gods know everything,which of the immortals it is that is hindering me, and tell me alsohow I may sail the sea so as to reach my home?'

íííí""Then,' he said, 'if you would finish your voyage and get homequickly, you must offer sacrifices to Jove and to the rest of the godsbefore embarking; for it is decreed that you shall not get back toyour friends, and to your own house, till you have returned to theheaven fed stream of Egypt, and offered holy hecatombs to the immortalgods that reign in heaven. When you have done this they will let youfinish your voyage.'

íííí""I was broken hearted when I heard that I must go back all that longand terrible voyage to Egypt; nevertheless, I answered, 'I will doall, old man, that you have laid upon me; but now tell me, and tell metrue, whether all the Achaeans whom Nestor and I left behind us whenwe set sail from Troy have got home safely, or whether any one of themcame to a bad end either on board his own ship or among his friendswhen the days of his fighting were done.'

íííí""'Son of Atreus,' he answered, 'why ask me? You had better notknow what I can tell you, for your eyes will surely fill when you haveheard my story. Many of those about whom you ask are dead and gone,but many still remain, and only two of the chief men among theAchaeans perished during their return home. As for what happened onthe field of battle- you were there yourself. A third Achaean leaderis still at sea, alive, but hindered from returning. Ajax was wrecked,for Neptune drove him on to the great rocks of Gyrae; nevertheless, helet him get safe out of the water, and in spite of all Minerva'shatred he would have escaped death, if he had not ruined himself byboasting. He said the gods could not drown him even though they hadtried to do so, and when Neptune heard this large talk, he seizedhis trident in his two brawny hands, and split the rock of Gyrae intwo pieces. The base remained where it was, but the part on which Ajaxwas sitting fell headlong into the sea and carried Ajax with it; so hedrank salt water and was drowned.

íííí""'Your brother and his ships escaped, for Juno protected him, butwhen he was just about to reach the high promontory of Malea, he wascaught by a heavy gale which carried him out to sea again sorelyagainst his will, and drove him to the foreland where Thyestes used todwell, but where Aegisthus was then living. By and by, however, itseemed as though he was to return safely after all, for the godsbacked the wind into its old quarter and they reached home; whereonAgamemnon kissed his native soil, and shed tears of joy at findinghimself in his own country.

íííí""'Now there was a watchman whom Aegisthus kept always on thewatch, and to whom he had promised two talents of gold. This man hadbeen looking out for a whole year to make sure that Agamemnon didnot give him the slip and prepare war; when, therefore, this man sawAgamemnon go by, he went and told Aegisthus who at once began to lay aplot for him. He picked twenty of his bravest warriors and placed themin ambuscade on one side the cloister, while on the opposite side heprepared a banquet. Then he sent his chariots and horsemen toAgamemnon, and invited him to the feast, but he meant foul play. Hegot him there, all unsuspicious of the doom that was awaiting him, andkilled him when the banquet was over as though he were butchering anox in the shambles; not one of Agamemnon's followers was left alive,nor yet one of Aegisthus', but they were all killed there in thecloisters.'

íííí""Thus spoke Proteus, and I was broken hearted as I heard him. Isat down upon the sands and wept; I felt as though I could no longerbear to live nor look upon the light of the sun. Presently, when I hadhad my fill of weeping and writhing upon the ground, the old man ofthe sea said, 'Son of Atreus, do not waste any more time in cryingso bitterly; it can do no manner of good; find your way home as fastas ever you can, for Aegisthus be still alive, and even though Oresteshas beforehand with you in kilting him, you may yet come in for hisfuneral.'

íííí""On this I took comfort in spite of all my sorrow, and said, 'Iknow, then, about these two; tell me, therefore, about the third manof whom you spoke; is he still alive, but at sea, and unable to gethome? or is he dead? Tell me, no matter how much it may grieve me.'

íííí""'The third man,' he answered, 'is Ulysses who dwells in Ithaca. Ican see him in an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of thenymph Calypso, who is keeping him prisoner, and he cannot reach hishome for he has no ships nor sailors to take him over the sea. Asfor your own end, Menelaus, you shall not die in Argos, but the godswill take you to the Elysian plain, which is at the ends of the world.There fair-haired Rhadamanthus reigns, and men lead an easier lifethan any where else in the world, for in Elysium there falls not rain,nor hail, nor snow, but Oceanus breathes ever with a West wind thatsings softly from the sea, and gives fresh life to all men. Thiswill happen to you because you have married Helen, and are Jove'sson-in-law.'

íííí""As he spoke he dived under the waves, whereon I turned back tothe ships with my companions, and my heart was clouded with care asI went along. When we reached the ships we got supper ready, for nightwas falling, and camped down upon the beach. When the child ofmorning, rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, we drew our ships into thewater, and put our masts and sails within them; then we went onboard ourselves, took our seats on the benches, and smote the grey seawith our oars. I again stationed my ships in the heaven-fed streamof Egypt, and offered hecatombs that were full and sufficient. WhenI had thus appeased heaven's anger, I raised a barrow to the memory ofAgamemnon that his name might live for ever, after which I had a quickpassage home, for the gods sent me a fair wind.

íííí""And now for yourself- stay here some ten or twelve days longer, andI will then speed you on your way. I will make you a noble presentof a chariot and three horses. I will also give you a beautifulchalice that so long as you live you may think of me whenever you makea drink-offering to the immortal gods.""

íííí""Son of Atreus,"" replied Telemachus, ""do not press me to staylonger; I should be contented to remain with you for another twelvemonths; I find your conversation so delightful that I should neveronce wish myself at home with my parents; but my crew whom I have leftat Pylos are already impatient, and you are detaining me from them. Asfor any present you may be disposed to make me, I had rather that itshould he a piece of plate. I will take no horses back with me toIthaca, but will leave them to adorn your own stables, for you havemuch flat ground in your kingdom where lotus thrives, as alsomeadowsweet and wheat and barley, and oats with their white andspreading ears; whereas in Ithaca we have neither open fields norracecourses, and the country is more fit for goats than horses, andI like it the better for that. None of our islands have much levelground, suitable for horses, and Ithaca least of all.""

ííííMenelaus smiled and took Telemachus's hand within his own. ""What yousay,"" said he, ""shows that you come of good family. I both can, andwill, make this exchange for you, by giving you the finest and mostprecious piece of plate in all my house. It is a mixing-bowl byVulcan's own hand, of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaidwith gold. Phaedimus, king of the Sidonians, gave it me in thecourse of a visit which I paid him when I returned thither on myhomeward journey. I will make you a present of it.""

ííííThus did they converse [and guests kept coming to the king'shouse. They brought sheep and wine, while their wives had put up breadfor them to take with them; so they were busy cooking their dinners inthe courts].

ííííMeanwhile the suitors were throwing discs or aiming with spears at amark on the levelled ground in front of Ulysses' house, and werebehaving with all their old insolence. Antinous and Eurymachus, whowere their ringleaders and much the foremost among them all, weresitting together when Noemon son of Phronius came up and said toAntinous,

íííí""Have we any idea, Antinous, on what day Telemachus returns fromPylos? He has a ship of mine, and I want it, to cross over to Elis:I have twelve brood mares there with yearling mule foals by their sidenot yet broken in, and I want to bring one of them over here and breakhim.""

ííííThey were astounded when they heard this, for they had made surethat Telemachus had not gone to the city of Neleus. They thought hewas only away somewhere on the farms, and was with the sheep, orwith the swineherd; so Antinous said, ""When did he go? Tell metruly, and what young men did he take with him? Were they freemen orhis own bondsmen- for he might manage that too? Tell me also, didyou let him have the ship of your own free will because he askedyou, or did he take it without yourleave?""

íííí""I lent it him,"" answered Noemon, ""what else could I do when a manof his position said he was in a difficulty, and asked me to obligehim? I could not possibly refuse. As for those who went with himthey were the best young men we have, and I saw Mentor go on boardas captain- or some god who was exactly like him. I cannotunderstand it, for I saw Mentor here myself yesterday morning, and yethe was then setting out for Pylos.""

ííííNoemon then went back to his father's house, but Antinous andEurymachus were very angry. They told the others to leave off playing,and to come and sit down along with themselves. When they came,Antinous son of Eupeithes spoke in anger. His heart was black withrage, and his eyes flashed fire as he said:

íííí""Good heavens, this voyage of Telemachus is a very serious matter;we had made sure that it would come to nothing, but the young fellowhas got away in spite of us, and with a picked crew too. He will begiving us trouble presently; may Jove take him before he is fullgrown. Find me a ship, therefore, with a crew of twenty men, and Iwill lie in wait for him in the straits between Ithaca and Samos; hewill then rue the day that he set out to try and get news of hisfather.""

ííííThus did he speak, and the others applauded his saying; they thenall of them went inside the buildings.

ííííIt was not long ere Penelope came to know what the suitors wereplotting; for a man servant, Medon, overheard them from outside theouter court as they were laying their schemes within, and went to tellhis mistress. As he crossed the threshold of her room Penelope said:""Medon, what have the suitors sent you here for? Is it to tell themaids to leave their master's business and cook dinner for them? Iwish they may neither woo nor dine henceforward, neither here noranywhere else, but let this be the very last time, for the waste youall make of my son's estate. Did not your fathers tell you when youwere children how good Ulysses had been to them- never doinganything high-handed, nor speaking harshly to anybody? Kings may saythings sometimes, and they may take a fancy to one man and dislikeanother, but Ulysses never did an unjust thing by anybody- which showswhat bad hearts you have, and that there is no such thing as gratitudeleft in this world.""

ííííThen Medon said, ""I wish, Madam, that this were all; but they areplotting something much more dreadful now- may heaven frustratetheir design. They are going to try and murder Telemachus as he iscoming home from Pylos and Lacedaemon, where he has been to get newsof his father.""

ííííThen Penelope's heart sank within her, and for a long time she wasspeechless; her eyes filled with tears, and she could find noutterance. At last, however, she said, ""Why did my son leave me?What business had he to go sailing off in ships that make long voyagesover the ocean like sea-horses? Does he want to die without leavingany one behind him to keep up his name?""

íííí""I do not know,"" answered Medon, ""whether some god set him on to it,or whether he went on his own impulse to see if he could find out ifhis father was dead, or alive and on his way home.""

ííííThen he went downstairs again, leaving Penelope in an agony ofgrief. There were plenty of seats in the house, but she. had noheart for sitting on any one of them; she could only fling herselfon the floor of her own room and cry; whereon all the maids in thehouse, both old and young, gathered round her and began to cry too,till at last in a transport of sorrow she exclaimed,

íííí""My dears, heaven has been pleased to try me with more afflictionthan any other woman of my age and country. First I lost my braveand lion-hearted husband, who had every good quality under heaven, andwhose name was great over all Hellas and middle Argos, and now mydarling son is at the mercy of the winds and waves, without myhaving heard one word about his leaving home. You hussies, there wasnot one of you would so much as think of giving me a call out of mybed, though you all of you very well knew when he was starting. If Ihad known he meant taking this voyage, he would have had to give itup, no matter how much he was bent upon it, or leave me a corpsebehind him- one or other. Now, however, go some of you and call oldDolius, who was given me by my father on my marriage, and who is mygardener. Bid him go at once and tell everything to Laertes, who maybe able to hit on some plan for enlisting public sympathy on our side,as against those who are trying to exterminate his own race and thatof Ulysses.""

ííííThen the dear old nurse Euryclea said, ""You may kill me, Madam, orlet me live on in your house, whichever you please, but I will tellyou the real truth. I knew all about it, and gave him everything hewanted in the way of bread and wine, but he made me take my solemnoath that I would not tell you anything for some ten or twelve days,unless you asked or happened to hear of his having gone, for he didnot want you to spoil your beauty by crying. And now, Madam, wash yourface, change your dress, and go upstairs with your maids to offerprayers to Minerva, daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, for she can savehim even though he be in the jaws of death. Do not trouble Laertes: hehas trouble enough already. Besides, I cannot think that the gods hatedie race of the race of the son of Arceisius so much, but there willbe a son left to come up after him, and inherit both the house and thefair fields that lie far all round it.""

ííííWith these words she made her mistress leave off crying, and driedthe tears from her eyes. Penelope washed her face, changed herdress, and went upstairs with her maids. She then put some bruisedbarley into a basket and began praying to Minerva.

íííí""Hear me,"" she cried, ""Daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove,unweariable. If ever Ulysses while he was here burned you fat thighbones of sheep or heifer, bear it in mind now as in my favour, andsave my darling son from the villainy of the suitors.""

ííííShe cried aloud as she spoke, and the goddess heard her prayer;meanwhile the suitors were clamorous throughout the coveredcloister, and one of them said:

íííí""The queen is preparing for her marriage with one or other of us.Little does she dream that her son has now been doomed to die.""

ííííThis was what they said, but they did not know what was going tohappen. Then Antinous said, ""Comrades, let there be no loud talking,lest some of it get carried inside. Let us be up and do that insilence, about which we are all of a mind.""

ííííHe then chose twenty men, and they went down to their. ship and tothe sea side; they drew the vessel into the water and got her mast andsails inside her; they bound the oars to the thole-pins with twistedthongs of leather, all in due course, and spread the white sailsaloft, while their fine servants brought them their armour. Thenthey made the ship fast a little way out, came on shore again, gottheir suppers, and waited till night should fall.

ííííBut Penelope lay in her own room upstairs unable to eat or drink,and wondering whether her brave son would escape, or be overpowered bythe wicked suitors. Like a lioness caught in the toils with huntsmenhemming her in on every side she thought and thought till she sankinto a slumber, and lay on her bed bereft of thought and motion.

ííííThen Minerva bethought her of another matter, and made a vision inthe likeness of Penelope's sister Iphthime daughter of Icarius who hadmarried Eumelus and lived in Pherae. She told the vision to go tothe house of Ulysses, and to make Penelope leave off crying, so itcame into her room by the hole through which the thong went forpulling the door to, and hovered over her head, saying,

íííí""You are asleep, Penelope: the gods who live at ease will not sufferyou to weep and be so sad. Your son has done them no wrong, so he willyet come back to you.""

ííííPenelope, who was sleeping sweetly at the gates of dreamland,answered, ""Sister, why have you come here? You do not come very often,but I suppose that is because you live such a long way off. Am I,then, to leave off crying and refrain from all the sad thoughts thattorture me? I, who have lost my brave and lion-hearted husband, whohad every good quality under heaven, and whose name was great over allHellas and middle Argos; and now my darling son has gone off onboard of a ship- a foolish fellow who has never been used toroughing it, nor to going about among gatherings of men. I am evenmore anxious about him than about my husband; I am all in a tremblewhen I think of him, lest something should happen to him, eitherfrom the people among whom he has gone, or by sea, for he has manyenemies who are plotting against him, and are bent on killing himbefore he can return home.""

ííííThen the vision said, ""Take heart, and be not so much dismayed.There is one gone with him whom many a man would be glad enough tohave stand by his side, I mean Minerva; it is she who has compassionupon you, and who has sent me to bear you this message.""

íííí""Then,"" said Penelope, ""if you are a god or have been sent here bydivine commission, tell me also about that other unhappy one- is hestill alive, or is he already dead and in the house of Hades?""

ííííAnd the vision said, ""I shall not tell you for certain whether he isalive or dead, and there is no use in idle conversation.""

ííííThen it vanished through the thong-hole of the door and wasdissipated into thin air; but Penelope rose from her sleep refreshedand comforted, so vivid had been her dream.

ííííMeantime the suitors went on board and sailed their ways over thesea, intent on murdering Telemachus. Now there is a rocky islet calledAsteris, of no great size, in mid channel between Ithaca and Samos,and there is a harbour on either side of it where a ship can lie. Herethen the Achaeans placed themselves in ambush.

ííííBOOK V.

ííííAND NOW, as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus- harbinger oflight alike to mortals and immortals- the gods met in council and withthem, Jove the lord of thunder, who is their king. Thereon Minervabegan to tell them of the many sufferings of Ulysses, for she pitiedhim away there in the house of the nymph Calypso.

íííí""Father Jove,"" said she, ""and all you other gods that live ineverlasting bliss, I hope there may never be such a thing as a kindand well-disposed ruler any more, nor one who will govern equitably. Ihope they will be all henceforth cruel and unjust, for there is notone of his subjects but has forgotten Ulysses, who ruled them asthough he were their father. There he is, lying in great pain in anisland where dwells the nymph Calypso, who will not let him go; and hecannot get back to his own country, for he can find neither shipsnor sailors to take him over the sea. Furthermore, wicked people arenow trying to murder his only son Telemachus, who is coming homefrom Pylos and Lacedaemon, where he has been to see if he can get newsof his father.""

íííí""What, my dear, are you talking about?"" replied her father, ""did younot send him there yourself, because you thought it would help Ulyssesto get home and punish the suitors? Besides, you are perfectly able toprotect Telemachus, and to see him safely home again, while thesuitors have to come hurry-skurrying back without having killed him.""

ííííWhen he had thus spoken, he said to his son Mercury, ""Mercury, youare our messenger, go therefore and tell Calypso we have decreedthat poor Ulysses is to return home. He is to be convoyed neither bygods nor men, but after a perilous voyage of twenty days upon a rafthe is to reach fertile Scheria, the land of the Phaeacians, who arenear of kin to the gods, and will honour him as though he were oneof ourselves. They will send him in a ship to his own country, andwill give him more bronze and gold and raiment than he would havebrought back from Troy, if he had had had all his prize money andhad got home without disaster. This is how we have settled that heshall return to his country and his friends.""

ííííThus he spoke, and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus, didas he was told. Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandalswith which he could fly like the wind over land and sea. He took thewand with which he seals men's eyes in sleep or wakes them just ashe pleases, and flew holding it in his hand over Pieria; then heswooped down through the firmament till he reached the level of thesea, whose waves he skimmed like a cormorant that flies fishingevery hole and corner of the ocean, and drenching its thick plumage inthe spray. He flew and flew over many a weary wave, but when at lasthe got to the island which was his journey's end, he left the seaand went on by land till he came to the cave where the nymph Calypsolived.

ííííHe found her at home. There was a large fire burning on thehearth, and one could smell from far the fragrant reek of burningcedar and sandal wood. As for herself, she was busy at her loom,shooting her golden shuttle through the warp and singingbeautifully. Round her cave there was a thick wood of alder, poplar,and sweet smelling cypress trees, wherein all kinds of great birds hadbuilt their nests- owls, hawks, and chattering sea-crows that occupytheir business in the waters. A vine loaded with grapes was trainedand grew luxuriantly about the mouth of the cave; there were also fourrunning rills of water in channels cut pretty close together, andturned hither and thither so as to irrigate the beds of violets andluscious herbage over which they flowed. Even a god could not helpbeing charmed with such a lovely spot, so Mercury stood still andlooked at it; but when he had admired it sufficiently he went insidethe cave.

ííííCalypso knew him at once- for the gods all know each other, nomatter how far they live from one another- but Ulysses was not within;he was on the sea-shore as usual, looking out upon the barren oceanwith tears in his eyes, groaning and breaking his heart for sorrow.Calypso gave Mercury a seat and said: ""Why have you come to see me,Mercury- honoured, and ever welcome- for you do not visit me often?Say what you want; I will do it for be you at once if I can, and if itcan be done at all; but come inside, and let me set refreshment beforeyou.

ííííAs she spoke she drew a table loaded with ambrosia beside him andmixed him some red nectar, so Mercury ate and drank till he had hadenough, and then said:

íííí""We are speaking god and goddess to one another, one another, andyou ask me why I have come here, and I will tell you truly as youwould have me do. Jove sent me; it was no doing of mine; who couldpossibly want to come all this way over the sea where there are nocities full of people to offer me sacrifices or choice hecatombs?Nevertheless I had to come, for none of us other gods can crossJove, nor transgress his orders. He says that you have here the mostill-starred of alf those who fought nine years before the city of KingPriam and sailed home in the tenth year after having sacked it. Ontheir way home they sinned against Minerva, who raised both wind andwaves against them, so that all his brave companions perished, andhe alone was carried hither by wind and tide. Jove says that you areto let this by man go at once, for it is decreed that he shall notperish here, far from his own people, but shall return to his houseand country and see his friends again.""

ííííCalypso trembled with rage when she heard this, ""You gods,"" sheexclaimed, to be ashamed of yourselves. You are always jealous andhate seeing a goddess take a fancy to a mortal man, and live withhim in open matrimony. So when rosy-fingered Dawn made love toOrion, you precious gods were all of you furious till Diana went andkilled him in Ortygia. So again when Ceres fell in love with Iasion,and yielded to him in a thrice ploughed fallow field, Jove came tohear of it before so long and killed Iasion with his thunder-bolts.And now you are angry with me too because I have a man here. I foundthe poor creature sitting all alone astride of a keel, for Jove hadstruck his ship with lightning and sunk it in mid ocean, so that allhis crew were drowned, while he himself was driven by wind and waveson to my island. I got fond of him and cherished him, and had set myheart on making him immortal, so that he should never grow old all hisdays; still I cannot cross Jove, nor bring his counsels to nothing;therefore, if he insists upon it, let the man go beyond the seasagain; but I cannot send him anywhere myself for I have neitherships nor men who can take him. Nevertheless I will readily give himsuch advice, in all good faith, as will be likely to bring himsafely to his own country.""

íííí""Then send him away,"" said Mercury, ""or Jove will be angry withyou and punish you""'

ííííOn this he took his leave, and Calypso went out to look for Ulysses,for she had heard Jove's message. She found him sitting upon the beachwith his eyes ever filled with tears, and dying of sheerhome-sickness; for he had got tired of Calypso, and though he wasforced to sleep with her in the cave by night, it was she, not he,that would have it so. As for the day time, he spent it on the rocksand on the sea-shore, weeping, crying aloud for his despair, andalways looking out upon the sea. Calypso then went close up to himsaid:

íííí""My poor fellow, you shall not stay here grieving and frettingyour life out any longer. I am going to send you away of my own freewill; so go, cut some beams of wood, and make yourself a large raftwith an upper deck that it may carry you safely over the sea. I willput bread, wine, and water on board to save you from starving. Iwill also give you clothes, and will send you a fair wind to takeyou home, if the gods in heaven so will it- for they know more aboutthese things, and can settle them better than I can.""

ííííUlysses shuddered as he heard her. ""Now goddess,"" he answered,""there is something behind all this; you cannot be really meaning tohelp me home when you bid me do such a dreadful thing as put to sea ona raft. Not even a well-found ship with a fair wind could venture onsuch a distant voyage: nothing that you can say or do shall mage me goon board a raft unless you first solemnly swear that you mean me nomischief.""

ííííCalypso smiled at this and caressed him with her hand: ""You know agreat deal,"" said she, ""but you are quite wrong here. May heaven aboveand earth below be my witnesses, with the waters of the river Styx-and this is the most solemn oath which a blessed god can take- thatI mean you no sort of harm, and am only advising you to do exactlywhat I should do myself in your place. I am dealing with you quitestraightforwardly; my heart is not made of iron, and I am very sorryfor you.""

ííííWhen she had thus spoken she led the way rapidly before him, andUlysses followed in her steps; so the pair, goddess and man, went onand on till they came to Calypso's cave, where Ulysses took the seatthat Mercury had just left. Calypso set meat and drink before him ofthe food that mortals eat; but her maids brought ambrosia and nectarfor herself, and they laid their hands on the good things that werebefore them. When they had satisfied themselves with meat and drink,Calypso spoke, saying:

íííí""Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, so you would start home to yourown land at once? Good luck go with you, but if you could only knowhow much suffering is in store for you before you get back to your owncountry, you would stay where you are, keep house along with me, andlet me make you immortal, no matter how anxious you may be to see thiswife of yours, of whom you are thinking all the time day after day;yet I flatter myself that at am no whit less tall or well-looking thanshe is, for it is not to be expected that a mortal woman shouldcompare in beauty with an immortal.""

íííí""Goddess,"" replied Ulysses, ""do not be angry with me about this. Iam quite aware that my wife Penelope is nothing like so tall or sobeautiful as yourself. She is only a woman, whereas you are animmortal. Nevertheless, I want to get home, and can think of nothingelse. If some god wrecks me when I am on the sea, I will bear it andmake the best of it. I have had infinite trouble both by land andsea already, so let this go with the rest.""

ííííPresently the sun set and it became dark, whereon the pair retiredinto the inner part of the cave and went to bed.

ííííWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Ulysses puton his shirt and cloak, while the goddess wore a dress of a lightgossamer fabric, very fine and graceful, with a beautiful goldengirdle about her waist and a veil to cover her head. She at once setherself to think how she could speed Ulysses on his way. So she gavehim a great bronze axe that suited his hands; it was sharpened on bothsides, and had a beautiful olive-wood handle fitted firmly on to it.She also gave him a sharp adze, and then led the way to the far end ofthe island where the largest trees grew- alder, poplar and pine,that reached the sky- very dry and well seasoned, so as to saillight for him in the water. Then, when she had shown him where thebest trees grew, Calypso went home, leaving him to cut them, whichhe soon finished doing. He cut down twenty trees in all and adzed themsmooth, squaring them by rule in good workmanlike fashion. MeanwhileCalypso came back with some augers, so he bored holes with them andfitted the timbers together with bolts and rivets. He made the raft asbroad as a skilled shipwright makes the beam of a large vessel, and hefiled a deck on top of the ribs, and ran a gunwale all round it. Healso made a mast with a yard arm, and a rudder to steer with. Hefenced the raft all round with wicker hurdles as a protectionagainst the waves, and then he threw on a quantity of wood. By andby Calypso brought him some linen to make the sails, and he made thesetoo, excellently, making them fast with braces and sheets. Last ofall, with the help of levers, he drew the raft down into the water.

ííííIn four days he had completed the whole work, and on the fifthCalypso sent him from the island after washing him and giving him someclean clothes. She gave him a goat skin full of black wine, andanother larger one of water; she also gave him a wallet full ofprovisions, and found him in much good meat. Moreover, she made thewind fair and warm for him, and gladly did Ulysses spread his sailbefore it, while he sat and guided the raft skilfully by means ofthe rudder. He never closed his eyes, but kept them fixed on thePleiads, on late-setting Bootes, and on the Bear- which men alsocall the wain, and which turns round and round where it is, facingOrion, and alone never dipping into the stream of Oceanus- for Calypsohad told him to keep this to his left. Days seven and ten did hesail over the sea, and on the eighteenth the dim outlines of themountains on the nearest part of the Phaeacian coast appeared,rising like a shield on the horizon.

ííííBut King Neptune, who was returning from the Ethiopians, caughtsight of Ulysses a long way off, from the mountains of the Solymi.He could see him sailing upon the sea, and it made him very angry,so he wagged his head and muttered to himself, saying, heavens, so thegods have been changing their minds about Ulysses while I was awayin Ethiopia, and now he is close to the land of the Phaeacians,where it is decreed that he shall escape from the calamities that havebefallen him. Still, he shall have plenty of hardship yet before hehas done with it.""

ííííThereon he gathered his clouds together, grasped his trident,stirred it round in the sea, and roused the rage of every wind thatblows till earth, sea, and sky were hidden in cloud, and nightsprang forth out of the heavens. Winds from East, South, North, andWest fell upon him all at the same time, and a tremendous sea gotup, so that Ulysses' heart began to fail him. ""Alas,"" he said tohimself in his dismay, ""what ever will become of me? I am afraidCalypso was right when she said I should have trouble by sea beforeI got back home. It is all coming true. How black is Jove makingheaven with his clouds, and what a sea the winds are raising fromevery quarter at once. I am now safe to perish. Blest and thrice blestwere those Danaans who fell before Troy in the cause of the sons ofAtreus. Would that had been killed on the day when the Trojans werepressing me so sorely about the dead body of Achilles, for then Ishould have had due burial and the Achaeans would have honoured myname; but now it seems that I shall come to a most pitiable end.""

ííííAs he spoke a sea broke over him with such terrific fury that theraft reeled again, and he was carried overboard a long way off. He letgo the helm, and the force of the hurricane was so great that it brokethe mast half way up, and both sail and yard went over into the sea.For a long time Ulysses was under water, and it was all he could do torise to the surface again, for the clothes Calypso had given himweighed him down; but at last he got his head above water and spat outthe bitter brine that was running down his face in streams. In spiteof all this, however, he did not lose sight of his raft, but swam asfast as he could towards it, got hold of it, and climbed on boardagain so as to escape drowning. The sea took the raft and tossed itabout as Autumn winds whirl thistledown round and round upon a road.It was as though the South, North, East, and West winds were allplaying battledore and shuttlecock with it at once.

ííííWhen he was in this plight, Ino daughter of Cadmus, also calledLeucothea, saw him. She had formerly been a mere mortal, but hadbeen since raised to the rank of a marine goddess. Seeing in whatgreat distress Ulysses now was, she had compassion upon him, and,rising like a sea-gull from the waves, took her seat upon the raft.

íííí""My poor good man,"" said she, ""why is Neptune so furiously angrywith you? He is giving you a great deal of trouble, but for all hisbluster he will not kill you. You seem to be a sensible person, dothen as I bid you; strip, leave your raft to drive before the wind,and swim to the Phaecian coast where better luck awaits you. And here,take my veil and put it round your chest; it is enchanted, and you cancome to no harm so long as you wear it. As soon as you touch land takeit off, throw it back as far as you can into the sea, and then go awayagain."" With these words she took off her veil and gave it him. Thenshe dived down again like a sea-gull and vanished beneath the darkblue waters.

ííííBut Ulysses did not know what to think. ""Alas,"" he said to himselfin his dismay, ""this is only some one or other of the gods who isluring me to ruin by advising me to will quit my raft. At any rate Iwill not do so at present, for the land where she said I should bequit of all troubles seemed to be still a good way off. I know whatI will do- I am sure it will be best- no matter what happens I willstick to the raft as long as her timbers hold together, but when thesea breaks her up I will swim for it; I do not see how I can do anybetter than this.""

ííííWhile he was thus in two minds, Neptune sent a terrible great wavethat seemed to rear itself above his head till it broke right over theraft, which then went to pieces as though it were a heap of drychaff tossed about by a whirlwind. Ulysses got astride of one plankand rode upon it as if he were on horseback; he then took off theclothes Calypso had given him, bound Ino's veil under his arms, andplunged into the sea- meaning to swim on shore. King Neptune watchedhim as he did so, and wagged his head, muttering to himself andsaying, ""'There now, swim up and down as you best can till you fall inwith well-to-do people. I do not think you will be able to say thatI have let you off too lightly."" On this he lashed his horses anddrove to Aegae where his palace is.

ííííBut Minerva resolved to help Ulysses, so she bound the ways of allthe winds except one, and made them lie quite still; but she rouseda good stiff breeze from the North that should lay the waters tillUlysses reached the land of the Phaeacians where he would be safe.

ííííThereon he floated about for two nights and two days in the water,with a heavy swell on the sea and death staring him in the face; butwhen the third day broke, the wind fell and there was a dead calmwithout so much as a breath of air stirring. As he rose on the swellhe looked eagerly ahead, and could see land quite near. Then, aschildren rejoice when their dear father begins to get better afterhaving for a long time borne sore affliction sent him by some angryspirit, but the gods deliver him from evil, so was Ulysses thankfulwhen he again saw land and trees, and swam on with all his strengththat he might once more set foot upon dry ground. When, however, hegot within earshot, he began to hear the surf thundering up againstthe rocks, for the swell still broke against them with a terrificroar. Everything was enveloped in spray; there were no harbourswhere a ship might ride, nor shelter of any kind, but onlyheadlands, low-lying rocks, and mountain tops.

ííííUlysses' heart now began to fail him, and he said despairingly tohimself, ""Alas, Jove has let me see land after swimming so far thatI had given up all hope, but I can find no landing place, for thecoast is rocky and surf-beaten, the rocks are smooth and rise sheerfrom the sea, with deep water close under them so that I cannotclimb out for want of foothold. I am afraid some great wave willlift me off my legs and dash me against the rocks as I leave thewater- which would give me a sorry landing. If, on the other hand, Iswim further in search of some shelving beach or harbour, ahurricane may carry me out to sea again sorely against my will, orheaven may send some great monster of the deep to attack me; forAmphitrite breeds many such, and I know that Neptune is very angrywith me.""

ííííWhile he was thus in two minds a wave caught him and took him withsuch force against the rocks that he would have been smashed andtorn to pieces if Minerva had not shown him what to do. He caught holdof the rock with both hands and clung to it groaning with pain tillthe wave retired, so he was saved that time; but presently the wavecame on again and carried him back with it far into the sea-tearinghis hands as the suckers of a polypus are torn when some one plucks itfrom its bed, and the stones come up along with it even so did therocks tear the skin from his strong hands, and then the wave drewhim deep down under the water.

ííííHere poor Ulysses would have certainly perished even in spite of hisown destiny, if Minerva had not helped him to keep his wits about him.He swam seaward again, beyond reach of the surf that was beatingagainst the land, and at the same time he kept looking towards theshore to see if he could find some haven, or a spit that should takethe waves aslant. By and by, as he swam on, he came to the mouth ofa river, and here he thought would be the best place, for there wereno rocks, and it afforded shelter from the wind. He felt that therewas a current, so he prayed inwardly and said:

íííí""Hear me, O King, whoever you may be, and save me from the angerof the sea-god Neptune, for I approach you prayerfully. Any one whohas lost his way has at all times a claim even upon the gods,wherefore in my distress I draw near to your stream, and cling tothe knees of your riverhood. Have mercy upon me, O king, for I declaremyself your suppliant.""

ííííThen the god stayed his stream and stilled the waves, making allcalm before him, and bringing him safely into the mouth of theriver. Here at last Ulysses' knees and strong hands failed him, forthe sea had completely broken him. His body was all swollen, and hismouth and nostrils ran down like a river with sea-water, so that hecould neither breathe nor speak, and lay swooning from sheerexhaustion; presently, when he had got his breath and came tohimself again, he took off the scarf that Ino had given him andthrew it back into the salt stream of the river, whereon Inoreceived it into her hands from the wave that bore it towards her.Then he left the river, laid himself down among the rushes, and kissedthe bounteous earth.

íííí""Alas,"" he cried to himself in his dismay, ""what ever will become ofme, and how is it all to end? If I stay here upon the river bedthrough the long watches of the night, I am so exhausted that thebitter cold and damp may make an end of me- for towards sunrisethere will be a keen wind blowing from off the river. If, on the otherhand, I climb the hill side, find shelter in the woods, and sleep insome thicket, I may escape the cold and have a good night's rest,but some savage beast may take advantage of me and devour me.""

ííííIn the end he deemed it best to take to the woods, and he foundone upon some high ground not far from the water. There he creptbeneath two shoots of olive that grew from a single stock- the onean ungrafted sucker, while the other had been grafted. No wind,however squally, could break through the cover they afforded, norcould the sun's rays pierce them, nor the rain get through them, soclosely did they grow into one another. Ulysses crept under theseand began to make himself a bed to lie on, for there was a greatlitter of dead leaves lying about- enough to make a covering for twoor three men even in hard winter weather. He was glad enough to seethis, so he laid himself down and heaped the leaves all round him.Then, as one who lives alone in the country, far from any neighbor,hides a brand as fire-seed in the ashes to save himself from having toget a light elsewhere, even so did Ulysses cover himself up withleaves; and Minerva shed a sweet sleep upon his eyes, closed hiseyelids, and made him lose all memories of his sorrows.

ííííBOOK VI.

ííííSO HERE Ulysses slept, overcome by sleep and toil; but Minervawent off to the country and city of the Phaecians- a people who usedto live in the fair town of Hypereia, near the lawless Cyclopes. Nowthe Cyclopes were stronger than they and plundered them, so their kingNausithous moved them thence and settled them in Scheria, far from allother people. He surrounded the city with a wall, built houses andtemples, and divided the lands among his people; but he was dead andgone to the house of Hades, and King Alcinous, whose counsels wereinspired of heaven, was now reigning. To his house, then, didMinerva hie in furtherance of the return of Ulysses.

ííííShe went straight to the beautifully decorated bedroom in whichthere slept a girl who was as lovely as a goddess, Nausicaa,daughter to King Alcinous. Two maid servants were sleeping near her,both very pretty, one on either side of the doorway, which wasclosed with well-made folding doors. Minerva took the form of thefamous sea captain Dymas's daughter, who was a bosom friend ofNausicaa and just her own age; then, coming up to the girl's bedsidelike a breath of wind, she hovered over her head and said:

íííí""Nausicaa, what can your mother have been about, to have such a lazydaughter? Here are your clothes all lying in disorder, yet you aregoing to be married almost immediately, and should not only be welldressed yourself, but should find good clothes for those who attendyou. This is the way to get yourself a good name, and to make yourfather and mother proud of you. Suppose, then, that we make tomorrow awashing day, and start at daybreak. I will come and help you so thatyou may have everything ready as soon as possible, for all the bestyoung men among your own people are courting you, and you are notgoing to remain a maid much longer. Ask your father, therefore, tohave a waggon and mules ready for us at daybreak, to take the rugs,robes, and girdles; and you can ride, too, which will be muchpleasanter for you than walking, for the washing-cisterns are some wayfrom the town.""

ííííWhen she had said this Minerva went away to Olympus, which theysay is the everlasting home of the gods. Here no wind beats roughly,and neither rain nor snow can fall; but it abides in everlastingsunshine and in a great peacefulness of light, wherein the blessedgods are illumined for ever and ever. This was the place to whichthe goddess went when she had given instructions to the girl.

ííííBy and by morning came and woke Nausicaa, who began wonderingabout her dream; she therefore went to the other end of the house totell her father and mother all about it, and found them in their ownroom. Her mother was sitting by the fireside spinning her purpleyarn with her maids around her, and she happened to catch her fatherjust as he was going out to attend a meeting of the town council,which the Phaeacian aldermen had convened. She stopped him and said:

íííí""Papa dear, could you manage to let me have a good big waggon? Iwant to take all our dirty clothes to the river and wash them. You arethe chief man here, so it is only right that you should have a cleanshirt when you attend meetings of the council. Moreover, you have fivesons at home, two of them married, while the other three aregood-looking bachelors; you know they always like to have cleanlinen when they go to a dance, and I have been thinking about allthis.""

ííííShe did not say a word about her own wedding, for she did not liketo, but her father knew and said, ""You shall have the mules, mylove, and whatever else you have a mind for. Be off with you, andthe men shall get you a good strong waggon with a body to it that willhold all your clothes.""

ííííOn this he gave his orders to the servants, who got the waggonout, harnessed the mules, and put them to, while the girl broughtthe clothes down from the linen room and placed them on the waggon.Her mother prepared her a basket of provisions with all sorts ofgood things, and a goat skin full of wine; the girl now got into thewaggon, and her mother gave her also a golden cruse of oil, that sheand her women might anoint themselves. Then she took the whip andreins and lashed the mules on, whereon they set off, and their hoofsclattered on the road. They pulled without flagging, and carried notonly Nausicaa and her wash of clothes, but the maids also who werewith her.

ííííWhen they reached the water side they went to thewashing-cisterns, through which there ran at all times enough purewater to wash any quantity of linen, no matter how dirty. Here theyunharnessed the mules and turned them out to feed on the sweet juicyherbage that grew by the water side. They took the clothes out ofthe waggon, put them in the water, and vied with one another intreading them in the pits to get the dirt out. After they had washedthem and got them quite clean, they laid them out by the sea side,where the waves had raised a high beach of shingle, and set aboutwashing themselves and anointing themselves with olive oil. Thenthey got their dinner by the side of the stream, and waited for thesun to finish drying the clothes. When they had done dinner they threwoff the veils that covered their heads and began to play at ball,while Nausicaa sang for them. As the huntress Diana goes forth uponthe mountains of Taygetus or Erymanthus to hunt wild boars or deer,and the wood-nymphs, daughters of Aegis-bearing Jove, take their sportalong with her (then is Leto proud at seeing her daughter stand a fullhead taller than the others, and eclipse the loveliest amid a wholebevy of beauties), even so did the girl outshine her handmaids.

ííííWhen it was time for them to start home, and they were folding theclothes and putting them into the waggon, Minerva began to considerhow Ulysses should wake up and see the handsome girl who was toconduct him to the city of the Phaeacians. The girl, therefore,threw a ball at one of the maids, which missed her and fell intodeep water. On this they all shouted, and the noise they made wokeUlysses, who sat up in his bed of leaves and began to wonder what itmight all be.

íííí""Alas,"" said he to himself, ""what kind of people have I comeamongst? Are they cruel, savage, and uncivilized, or hospitable andhumane? I seem to hear the voices of young women, and they soundlike those of the nymphs that haunt mountain tops, or springs ofrivers and meadows of green grass. At any rate I am among a race ofmen and women. Let me try if I cannot manage to get a look at them.""

ííííAs he said this he crept from under his bush, and broke off abough covered with thick leaves to hide his nakedness. He lookedlike some lion of the wilderness that stalks about exulting in hisstrength and defying both wind and rain; his eyes glare as he prowlsin quest of oxen, sheep, or deer, for he is famished, and will darebreak even into a well-fenced homestead, trying to get at the sheep-even such did Ulysses seem to the young women, as he drew near to themall naked as he was, for he was in great want. On seeing one sounkempt and so begrimed with salt water, the others scampered offalong the spits that jutted out into the sea, but the daughter ofAlcinous stood firm, for Minerva put courage into her heart and tookaway all fear from her. She stood right in front of Ulysses, and hedoubted whether he should go up to her, throw himself at her feet, andembrace her knees as a suppliant, or stay where he was and entreat herto give him some clothes and show him the way to the town. In theend he deemed it best to entreat her from a distance in case thegirl should take offence at his coming near enough to clasp her knees,so he addressed her in honeyed and persuasive language.

íííí""O queen,"" he said, ""I implore your aid- but tell me, are you agoddess or are you a mortal woman? If you are a goddess and dwell inheaven, I can only conjecture that you are Jove's daughter Diana,for your face and figure resemble none but hers; if on the otherhand you are a mortal and live on earth, thrice happy are yourfather and mother- thrice happy, too, are your brothers and sisters;how proud and delighted they must feel when they see so fair a scionas yourself going out to a dance; most happy, however, of all willhe be whose wedding gifts have been the richest, and who takes youto his own home. I never yet saw any one so beautiful, neither man norwoman, and am lost in admiration as I behold you. I can only compareyou to a young palm tree which I saw when I was at Delos growingnear the altar of Apollo- for I was there, too, with much people afterme, when I was on that journey which has been the source of all mytroubles. Never yet did such a young plant shoot out of the groundas that was, and I admired and wondered at it exactly as I nowadmire and wonder at yourself. I dare not clasp your knees, but I amin great distress; yesterday made the twentieth day that I had beentossing about upon the sea. The winds and waves have taken me allthe way from the Ogygian island, and now fate has flung me upon thiscoast that I may endure still further suffering; for I do not thinkthat I have yet come to the end of it, but rather that heaven hasstill much evil in store for me.

íííí""And now, O queen, have pity upon me, for you are the first person Ihave met, and I know no one else in this country. Show me the way toyour town, and let me have anything that you may have brought hitherto wrap your clothes in. May heaven grant you in all things yourheart's desire- husband, house, and a happy, peaceful home; forthere is nothing better in this world than that man and wife should beof one mind in a house. It discomfits their enemies, makes thehearts of their friends glad, and they themselves know more about itthan any one.""

ííííTo this Nausicaa answered, ""Stranger, you appear to be a sensible,well-disposed person. There is no accounting for luck; Jove givesprosperity to rich and poor just as he chooses, so you must takewhat he has seen fit to send you, and make the best of it. Now,however, that you have come to this our country, you shall not wantfor clothes nor for anything else that a foreigner in distress mayreasonably look for. I will show you the way to the town, and willtell you the name of our people; we are called Phaeacians, and I amdaughter to Alcinous, in whom the whole power of the state is vested.""

ííííThen she called her maids and said, ""Stay where you are, yougirls. Can you not see a man without running away from him? Do youtake him for a robber or a murderer? Neither he nor any one else cancome here to do us Phaeacians any harm, for we are dear to the gods,and live apart on a land's end that juts into the sounding sea, andhave nothing to do with any other people. This is only some poor manwho has lost his way, and we must be kind to him, for strangers andforeigners in distress are under Jove's protection, and will take whatthey can get and be thankful; so, girls, give the poor fellowsomething to eat and drink, and wash him in the stream at some placethat is sheltered from the wind.""

ííííOn this the maids left off running away and began calling oneanother back. They made Ulysses sit down in the shelter as Nausicaahad told them, and brought him a shirt and cloak. They also broughthim the little golden cruse of oil, and told him to go wash in thestream. But Ulysses said, ""Young women, please to stand a little onone side that I may wash the brine from my shoulders and anoint myselfwith oil, for it is long enough since my skin has had a drop of oilupon it. I cannot wash as long as you all keep standing there. I amashamed to strip before a number of good-looking young women.""

ííííThen they stood on one side and went to tell the girl, while Ulysseswashed himself in the stream and scrubbed the brine from his backand from his broad shoulders. When he had thoroughly washed himself,and had got the brine out of his hair, he anointed himself with oil,and put on the clothes which the girl had given him; Minerva then madehim look taller and stronger than before, she also made the hairgrow thick on the top of his head, and flow down in curls likehyacinth blossoms; she glorified him about the head and shoulders as askilful workman who has studied art of all kinds under Vulcan andMinerva enriches a piece of silver plate by gilding it- and his workis full of beauty. Then he went and sat down a little way off upon thebeach, looking quite young and handsome, and the girl gazed on himwith admiration; then she said to her maids:

íííí""Hush, my dears, for I want to say something. I believe the gods wholive in heaven have sent this man to the Phaeacians. When I firstsaw him I thought him plain, but now his appearance is like that ofthe gods who dwell in heaven. I should like my future husband to bejust such another as he is, if he would only stay here and not want togo away. However, give him something to eat and drink.""

ííííThey did as they were told, and set food before Ulysses, who ate anddrank ravenously, for it was long since he had had food of any kind.Meanwhile, Nausicaa bethought her of another matter. She got the linenfolded and placed in the waggon, she then yoked the mules, and, as shetook her seat, she called Ulysses:

íííí""Stranger,"" said she, ""rise and let us be going back to the town;I will introduce you at the house of my excellent father, where Ican tell you that you will meet all the best people among thePhaecians. But be sure and do as I bid you, for you seem to be asensible person. As long as we are going past the fields- and farmlands, follow briskly behind the waggon along with the maids and Iwill lead the way myself. Presently, however, we shall come to thetown, where you will find a high wall running all round it, and a goodharbour on either side with a narrow entrance into the city, and theships will be drawn up by the road side, for every one has a placewhere his own ship can lie. You will see the market place with atemple of Neptune in the middle of it, and paved with large stonesbedded in the earth. Here people deal in ship's gear of all kinds,such as cables and sails, and here, too, are the places where oars aremade, for the Phaeacians are not a nation of archers; they knownothing about bows and arrows, but are a sea-faring folk, and pridethemselves on their masts, oars, and ships, with which they travel farover the sea.

íííí""I am afraid of the gossip and scandal that may be set on footagainst me later on; for the people here are very ill-natured, andsome low fellow, if he met us, might say, 'Who is this fine-lookingstranger that is going about with Nausicaa? Where did she End him? Isuppose she is going to marry him. Perhaps he is a vagabond sailorwhom she has taken from some foreign vessel, for we have noneighbours; or some god has at last come down from heaven in answer toher prayers, and she is going to live with him all the rest of herlife. It would be a good thing if she would take herself of I for shand find a husband somewhere else, for she will not look at one of themany excellent young Phaeacians who are in with her.' This is the kindof disparaging remark that would be made about me, and I could notcomplain, for I should myself be scandalized at seeing any othergirl do the like, and go about with men in spite of everybody, whileher father and mother were still alive, and without having beenmarried in the face of all the world.

íííí""If, therefore, you want my father to give you an escort and to helpyou home, do as I bid you; you will see a beautiful grove of poplarsby the road side dedicated to Minerva; it has a well in it and ameadow all round it. Here my father has a field of rich garden ground,about as far from the town as a man' voice will carry. Sit downthere and wait for a while till the rest of us can get into the townand reach my father's house. Then, when you think we must have donethis, come into the town and ask the way to the house of my fatherAlcinous. You will have no difficulty in finding it; any child willpoint it out to you, for no one else in the whole town has anythinglike such a fine house as he has. When you have got past the gates andthrough the outer court, go right across the inner court till you cometo my mother. You will find her sitting by the fire and spinning herpurple wool by firelight. It is a fine sight to see her as she leansback against one of the bearing-posts with her maids all ranged behindher. Close to her seat stands that of my father, on which he sitsand topes like an immortal god. Never mind him, but go up to mymother, and lay your hands upon her knees if you would get homequickly. If you can gain her over, you may hope to see your owncountry again, no matter how distant it may be.""

ííííSo saying she lashed the mules with her whip and they left theriver. The mules drew well and their hoofs went up and down upon theroad. She was careful not to go too fast for Ulysses and the maids whowere following on foot along with the waggon, so she plied her whipwith judgement. As the sun was going down they came to the sacredgrove of Minerva, and there Ulysses sat down and prayed to themighty daughter of Jove.

íííí""Hear me,"" he cried, ""daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable,hear me now, for you gave no heed to my prayers when Neptune waswrecking me. Now, therefore, have pity upon me and grant that I mayfind friends and be hospitably received by the Phaecians.""

ííííThus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer, but she would notshow herself to him openly, for she was afraid of her uncle Neptune,who was still furious in his endeavors to prevent Ulysses from gettinghome.

ííííBOOK VII.

ííííTHUS, then, did Ulysses wait and pray; but the girl drove on tothe town. When she reached her father's house she drew up at thegateway, and her brothers- comely as the gods- gathered round her,took the mules out of the waggon, and carried the clothes into thehouse, while she went to her own room, where an old servant,Eurymedusa of Apeira, lit the fire for her. This old woman had beenbrought by sea from Apeira, and had been chosen as a prize forAlcinous because he was king over the Phaecians, and the people obeyedhim as though he were a god. She had been nurse to Nausicaa, and hadnow lit the fire for her, and brought her supper for her into herown room.

ííííPresently Ulysses got up to go towards the town; and Minerva sheda thick mist all round him to hide him in case any of the proudPhaecians who met him should be rude to him, or ask him who he was.Then, as he was just entering the town, she came towards him in thelikeness of a little girl carrying a pitcher. She stood right in frontof him, and Ulysses said:

íííí""My dear, will you be so kind as to show me the house of kingAlcinous? I am an unfortunate foreigner in distress, and do not knowone in your town and country.""

ííííThen Minerva said, ""Yes, father stranger, I will show you thehouse you want, for Alcinous lives quite close to my own father. Iwill go before you and show the way, but say not a word as you go, anddo not look at any man, nor ask him questions; for the people herecannot abide strangers, and do not like men who come from some otherplace. They are a sea-faring folk, and sail the seas by the grace ofNeptune in ships that glide along like thought, or as a bird in theair.""

ííííOn this she led the way, and Ulysses followed in her steps; butnot one of the Phaecians could see him as he passed through the cityin the midst of them; for the great goddess Minerva in her good willtowards him had hidden him in a thick cloud of darkness. He admiredtheir harbours, ships, places of assembly, and the lofty walls ofthe city, which, with the palisade on top of them, were very striking,and when they reached the king's house Minerva said:

íííí""This is the house, father stranger, which you would have me showyou. You will find a number of great people sitting at table, but donot be afraid; go straight in, for the bolder a man is the more likelyhe is to carry his point, even though he is a stranger. First find thequeen. Her name is Arete, and she comes of the same family as herhusband Alcinous. They both descend originally from Neptune, who wasfather to Nausithous by Periboea, a woman of great beauty. Periboeawas the youngest daughter of Eurymedon, who at one time reigned overthe giants, but he ruined his ill-fated people and lost his own lifeto boot.

íííí""Neptune, however, lay with his daughter, and she had a son byhim, the great Nausithous, who reigned over the Phaecians.Nausithous had two sons Rhexenor and Alcinous; Apollo killed the firstof them while he was still a bridegroom and without male issue; but heleft a daughter Arete, whom Alcinous married, and honours as noother woman is honoured of all those that keep house along withtheir husbands.

íííí""Thus she both was, and still is, respected beyond measure by herchildren, by Alcinous himself, and by the whole people, who lookupon her as a goddess, and greet her whenever she goes about the city,for she is a thoroughly good woman both in head and heart, and whenany women are friends of hers, she will help their husbands also tosettle their disputes. If you can gain her good will, you may haveevery hope of seeing your friends again, and getting safely back toyour home and country.""

ííííThen Minerva left Scheria and went away over the sea. She went toMarathon and to the spacious streets of Athens, where she enteredthe abode of Erechtheus; but Ulysses went on to the house of Alcinous,and he pondered much as he paused a while before reaching thethreshold of bronze, for the splendour of the palace was like thatof the sun or moon. The walls on either side were of bronze from endto end, and the cornice was of blue enamel. The doors were gold, andhung on pillars of silver that rose from a floor of bronze, whilethe lintel was silver and the hook of the door was of gold.

ííííOn either side there stood gold and silver mastiffs which Vulcan,with his consummate skill, had fashioned expressly to keep watchover the palace of king Alcinous; so they were immortal and couldnever grow old. Seats were ranged all along the wall, here and therefrom one end to the other, with coverings of fine woven work which thewomen of the house had made. Here the chief persons of the Phaeciansused to sit and eat and drink, for there was abundance at all seasons;and there were golden figures of young men with lighted torches intheir hands, raised on pedestals, to give light by night to thosewho were at table. There are fifty maid servants in the house, some ofwhom are always grinding rich yellow grain at the mill, while otherswork at the loom, or sit and spin, and their shuttles go, backwardsand forwards like the fluttering of aspen leaves, while the linen isso closely woven that it will turn oil. As the Phaecians are thebest sailors in the world, so their women excel all others in weaving,for Minerva has taught them all manner of useful arts, and they arevery intelligent.

ííííOutside the gate of the outer court there is a large garden of aboutfour acres with a wall all round it. It is full of beautiful trees-pears, pomegranates, and the most delicious apples. There are lusciousfigs also, and olives in full growth. The fruits never rot nor failall the year round, neither winter nor summer, for the air is sosoft that a new crop ripens before the old has dropped. Pear growson pear, apple on apple, and fig on fig, and so also with thegrapes, for there is an excellent vineyard: on the level ground of apart of this, the grapes are being made into raisins; in anotherpart they are being gathered; some are being trodden in the wine tubs,others further on have shed their blossom and are beginning to showfruit, others again are just changing colour. In the furthest partof the ground there are beautifully arranged beds of flowers thatare in bloom all the year round. Two streams go through it, the oneturned in ducts throughout the whole garden, while the other iscarried under the ground of the outer court to the house itself, andthe town's people draw water from it. Such, then, were thesplendours with which the gods had endowed the house of king Alcinous.

ííííSo here Ulysses stood for a while and looked about him, but whenhe had looked long enough he crossed the threshold and went within theprecincts of the house. There he found all the chief people amongthe Phaecians making their drink-offerings to Mercury, which theyalways did the last thing before going away for the night. He wentstraight through the court, still hidden by the cloak of darkness inwhich Minerva had enveloped him, till he reached Arete and KingAlcinous; then he laid his hands upon the knees of the queen, and atthat moment the miraculous darkness fell away from him and he becamevisible. Every one was speechless with surprise at seeing a man there,but Ulysses began at once with his petition.

íííí""Queen Arete,"" he exclaimed, ""daughter of great Rhexenor, in mydistress I humbly pray you, as also your husband and these your guests(whom may heaven prosper with long life and happiness, and may theyleave their possessions to their children, and all the honoursconferred upon them by the state) to help me home to my own country assoon as possible; for I have been long in trouble and away from myfriends.""

ííííThen he sat down on the hearth among the ashes and they all heldtheir peace, till presently the old hero Echeneus, who was anexcellent speaker and an elder among the Phaeacians, plainly and inall honesty addressed them thus:

íííí""Alcinous,"" said he, ""it is not creditable to you that a strangershould be seen sitting among the ashes of your hearth; every one iswaiting to hear what you are about to say; tell him, then, to rise andtake a seat on a stool inlaid with silver, and bid your servants mixsome wine and water that we may make a drink-offering to Jove the lordof thunder, who takes all well-disposed suppliants under hisprotection; and let the housekeeper give him some supper, ofwhatever there may be in the house.""

ííííWhen Alcinous heard this he took Ulysses by the hand, raised himfrom the hearth, and bade him take the seat of Laodamas, who hadbeen sitting beside him, and was his favourite son. A maid servantthen brought him water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into asilver basin for him to wash his hands, and she drew a clean tablebeside him; an upper servant brought him bread and offered him manygood things of what there was in the house, and Ulysses ate and drank.Then Alcinous said to one of the servants, ""Pontonous, mix a cup ofwine and hand it round that we may make drink-offerings to Jove thelord of thunder, who is the protector of all well-disposedsuppliants.""

ííííPontonous then mixed wine and water, and handed it round aftergiving every man his drink-offering. When they had made theirofferings, and had drunk each as much as he was minded, Alcinous said:

íííí""Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, hear my words. Youhave had your supper, so now go home to bed. To-morrow morning I shallinvite a still larger number of aldermen, and will give asacrificial banquet in honour of our guest; we can then discuss thequestion of his escort, and consider how we may at once send himback rejoicing to his own country without trouble or inconvenienceto himself, no matter how distant it may be. We must see that he comesto no harm while on his homeward journey, but when he is once athome he will have to take the luck he was born with for better orworse like other people. It is possible, however, that the stranger isone of the immortals who has come down from heaven to visit us; but inthis case the gods are departing from their usual practice, forhitherto they have made themselves perfectly clear to us when wehave been offering them hecatombs. They come and sit at our feastsjust like one of our selves, and if any solitary wayfarer happens tostumble upon some one or other of them, they affect no concealment,for we are as near of kin to the gods as the Cyclopes and the savagegiants are.""

ííííThen Ulysses said: ""Pray, Alcinous, do not take any such notion intoyour head. I have nothing of the immortal about me, neither in bodynor mind, and most resemble those among you who are the mostafflicted. Indeed, were I to tell you all that heaven has seen fitto lay upon me, you would say that I was still worse off than theyare. Nevertheless, let me sup in spite of sorrow, for an empty stomachis a very importunate thing, and thrusts itself on a man's notice nomatter how dire is his distress. I am in great trouble, yet it insiststhat I shall eat and drink, bids me lay aside all memory of my sorrowsand dwell only on the due replenishing of itself. As for yourselves,do as you propose, and at break of day set about helping me to gethome. I shall be content to die if I may first once more behold myproperty, my bondsmen, and all the greatness of my house.""

ííííThus did he speak. Every one approved his saying, and agreed that heshould have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably. Then whenthey had made their drink-offerings, and had drunk each as much ashe was minded they went home to bed every man in his own abode,leaving Ulysses in the cloister with Arete and Alcinous while theservants were taking the things away after supper. Arete was the firstto speak, for she recognized the shirt, cloak, and good clothes thatUlysses was wearing, as the work of herself and of her maids; so shesaid, ""Stranger, before we go any further, there is a question Ishould like to ask you. Who, and whence are you, and who gave youthose clothes? Did you not say you had come here from beyond the sea?""

ííííAnd Ulysses answered, ""It would be a long story Madam, were I torelate in full the tale of my misfortunes, for the hand of heavenhas been laid heavy upon me; but as regards your question, there is anisland far away in the sea which is called 'the Ogygian.' Heredwells the cunning and powerful goddess Calypso, daughter of Atlas.She lives by herself far from all neighbours human or divine. Fortune,however, me to her hearth all desolate and alone, for Jove struck myship with his thunderbolts, and broke it up in mid-ocean. My bravecomrades were drowned every man of them, but I stuck to the keel andwas carried hither and thither for the space of nine days, till atlast during the darkness of the tenth night the gods brought me to theOgygian island where the great goddess Calypso lives. She took me inand treated me with the utmost kindness; indeed she wanted to makeme immortal that I might never grow old, but she could not persuade meto let her do so.

íííí""I stayed with Calypso seven years straight on end, and wateredthe good clothes she gave me with my tears during the whole time;but at last when the eighth year came round she bade me depart ofher own free will, either because Jove had told her she must, orbecause she had changed her mind. She sent me from her island on araft, which she provisioned with abundance of bread and wine. Moreovershe gave me good stout clothing, and sent me a wind that blew bothwarm and fair. Days seven and ten did I sail over the sea, and onthe eighteenth I caught sight of the first outlines of the mountainsupon your coast- and glad indeed was I to set eyes upon them.Nevertheless there was still much trouble in store for me, for at thispoint Neptune would let me go no further, and raised a great stormagainst me; the sea was so terribly high that I could no longer keepto my raft, which went to pieces under the fury of the gale, and I hadto swim for it, till wind and current brought me to your shores.

íííí""There I tried to land, but could not, for it was a bad place andthe waves dashed me against the rocks, so I again took to the seaand swam on till I came to a river that seemed the most likely landingplace, for there were no rocks and it was sheltered from the wind.Here, then, I got out of the water and gathered my senses togetheragain. Night was coming on, so I left the river, and went into athicket, where I covered myself all over with leaves, and presentlyheaven sent me off into a very deep sleep. Sick and sorry as I was Islept among the leaves all night, and through the next day tillafternoon, when I woke as the sun was westering, and saw yourdaughter's maid servants playing upon the beach, and your daughteramong them looking like a goddess. I besought her aid, and sheproved to be of an excellent disposition, much more so than could beexpected from so young a person- for young people are apt to bethoughtless. She gave me plenty of bread and wine, and when she hadhad me washed in the river she also gave me the clothes in which yousee me. Now, therefore, though it has pained me to do so, I havetold you the whole truth.""

ííííThen Alcinous said, ""Stranger, it was very wrong of my daughternot to bring you on at once to my house along with the maids, seeingthat she was the first person whose aid you asked.""

íííí""Pray do not scold her,"" replied Ulysses; ""she is not to blame.She did tell me to follow along with the maids, but I was ashamedand afraid, for I thought you might perhaps be displeased if you sawme. Every human being is sometimes a little suspicious and irritable.""

íííí""Stranger,"" replied Alcinous, ""I am not the kind of man to get angryabout nothing; it is always better to be reasonable; but by FatherJove, Minerva, and Apollo, now that I see what kind of person you are,and how much you think as I do, I wish you would stay here, marry mydaughter, and become my son-in-law. If you will stay I will give you ahouse and an estate, but no one (heaven forbid) shall keep you hereagainst your own wish, and that you may be sure of this I willattend to-morrow to the matter of your escort. You can sleep duringthe whole voyage if you like, and the men shall sail you over smoothwaters either to your own home, or wherever you please, even though itbe a long way further off than Euboea, which those of my people whosaw it when they took yellow-haired Rhadamanthus to see Tityus the sonof Gaia, tell me is the furthest of any place- and yet they did thewhole voyage in a single day without distressing themselves, andcame back again afterwards. You will thus see how much my shipsexcel all others, and what magnificent oarsmen my sailors are.""

ííííThen was Ulysses glad and prayed aloud saying, ""Father Jove, grantthat Alcinous may do all as he has said, for so he will win animperishable name among mankind, and at the same time I shall returnto my country.""

ííííThus did they converse. Then Arete told her maids to set a bed inthe room that was in the gatehouse, and make it with good red rugs,and to spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks forUlysses to wear. The maids thereon went out with torches in theirhands, and when they had made the bed they came up to Ulysses andsaid, ""Rise, sir stranger, and come with us for your bed is ready,""and glad indeed was he to go to his rest.

ííííSo Ulysses slept in a bed placed in a room over the echoing gateway;but Alcinous lay in the inner part of the house, with the queen hiswife by his side.

ííííBOOK VIII.

ííííNOW when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared,Alcinous and Ulysses both rose, and Alcinous led the way to thePhaecian place of assembly, which was near the ships. When they gotthere they sat down side by side on a seat of polished stone, whileMinerva took the form of one of Alcinous' servants, and went round thetown in order to help Ulysses to get home. She went up to thecitizens, man by man, and said, ""Aldermen and town councillors ofthe Phaeacians, come to the assembly all of you and listen to thestranger who has just come off a long voyage to the house of KingAlcinous; he looks like an immortal god.""

ííííWith these words she made them all want to come, and they flocked tothe assembly till seats and standing room were alike crowded. Everyone was struck with the appearance of Ulysses, for Minerva hadbeautified him about the head and shoulders, making him look tallerand stouter than he really was, that he might impress the Phaeciansfavourably as being a very remarkable man, and might come off wellin the many trials of skill to which they would challenge him. Then,when they were got together, Alcinous spoke:

íííí""Hear me,"" said he, ""aldermen and town councillors of thePhaeacians, that I may speak even as I am minded. This stranger,whoever he may be, has found his way to my house from somewhere orother either East or West. He wants an escort and wishes to have thematter settled. Let us then get one ready for him, as we have done forothers before him; indeed, no one who ever yet came to my house hasbeen able to complain of me for not speeding on his way soon enough.Let us draw a ship into the sea- one that has never yet made a voyage-and man her with two and fifty of our smartest young sailors. Thenwhen you have made fast your oars each by his own seat, leave the shipand come to my house to prepare a feast. I will find you ineverything. I am giving will these instructions to the young men whowill form the crew, for as regards you aldermen and towncouncillors, you will join me in entertaining our guest in thecloisters. I can take no excuses, and we will have Demodocus to singto us; for there is no bard like him whatever he may choose to singabout.""

ííííAlcinous then led the way, and the others followed after, while aservant went to fetch Demodocus. The fifty-two picked oarsmen wentto the sea shore as they had been told, and when they got there theydrew the ship into the water, got her mast and sails inside her, boundthe oars to the thole-pins with twisted thongs of leather, all indue course, and spread the white sails aloft. They moored the vessel alittle way out from land, and then came on shore and went to the houseof King Alcinous. The outhouses, yards, and all the precincts werefilled with crowds of men in great multitudes both old and young;and Alcinous killed them a dozen sheep, eight full grown pigs, and twooxen. These they skinned and dressed so as to provide a magnificentbanquet.

ííííA servant presently led in the famous bard Demodocus, whom themuse had dearly loved, but to whom she had given both good and evil,for though she had endowed him with a divine gift of song, she hadrobbed him of his eyesight. Pontonous set a seat for him among theguests, leaning it up against a bearing-post. He hung the lyre for himon a peg over his head, and showed him where he was to feel for itwith his hands. He also set a fair table with a basket of victualsby his side, and a cup of wine from which he might drink whenever hewas so disposed.

ííííThe company then laid their hands upon the good things that werebefore them, but as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink,the muse inspired Demodocus to sing the feats of heroes, and moreespecially a matter that was then in the mouths of all men, to wit,the quarrel between Ulysses and Achilles, and the fierce words thatthey heaped on one another as they gat together at a banquet. ButAgamemnon was glad when he heard his chieftains quarrelling with oneanother, for Apollo had foretold him this at Pytho when he crossed thestone floor to consult the oracle. Here was the beginning of theevil that by the will of Jove fell both Danaans and Trojans.

ííííThus sang the bard, but Ulysses drew his purple mantle over his headand covered his face, for he was ashamed to let the Phaeacians seethat he was weeping. When the bard left off singing he wiped the tearsfrom his eyes, uncovered his face, and, taking his cup, made adrink-offering to the gods; but when the Phaeacians pressedDemodocus to sing further, for they delighted in his lays, thenUlysses again drew his mantle over his head and wept bitterly. Noone noticed his distress except Alcinous, who was sitting near him,and heard the heavy sighs that he was heaving. So he at once said,""Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, we have had enoughnow, both of the feast, and of the minstrelsy that is its dueaccompaniment; let us proceed therefore to the athletic sports, sothat our guest on his return home may be able to tell his friendshow much we surpass all other nations as boxers, wrestlers, jumpers,and runners.""

ííííWith these words he led the way, and the others followed after. Aservant hung Demodocus's lyre on its peg for him, led him out of thecloister, and set him on the same way as that along which all thechief men of the Phaeacians were going to see the sports; a crowd ofseveral thousands of people followed them, and there were manyexcellent competitors for all the prizes. Acroneos, Ocyalus, Elatreus,Nauteus, Prymneus, Anchialus, Eretmeus, Ponteus, Proreus, Thoon,Anabesineus, and Amphialus son of Polyneus son of Tecton. There wasalso Euryalus son of Naubolus, who was like Mars himself, and wasthe best looking man among the Phaecians except Laodamas. Three sonsof Alcinous, Laodamas, Halios, and Clytoneus, competed also.

ííííThe foot races came first. The course was set out for them fromthe starting post, and they raised a dust upon the plain as they allflew forward at the same moment. Clytoneus came in first by a longway; he left every one else behind him by the length of the furrowthat a couple of mules can plough in a fallow field. They thenturned to the painful art of wrestling, and here Euryalus proved to bethe best man. Amphialus excelled all the others in jumping, while atthrowing the disc there was no one who could approach Elatreus.Alcinous's son Laodamas was the best boxer, and he it was whopresently said, when they had all been diverted with the games, ""Letus ask the stranger whether he excels in any of these sports; he seemsvery powerfully built; his thighs, claves, hands, and neck are ofprodigious strength, nor is he at all old, but he has suffered muchlately, and there is nothing like the sea for making havoc with a man,no matter how strong he is.""

íííí""You are quite right, Laodamas,"" replied Euryalus, ""go up to yourguest and speak to him about it yourself.""

ííííWhen Laodamas heard this he made his way into the middle of thecrowd and said to Ulysses, ""I hope, Sir, that you will enteryourself for some one or other of our competitions if you areskilled in any of them- and you must have gone in for many a onebefore now. There is nothing that does any one so much credit allhis life long as the showing himself a proper man with his hands andfeet. Have a try therefore at something, and banish all sorrow fromyour mind. Your return home will not be long delayed, for the shipis already drawn into the water, and the crew is found.""

ííííUlysses answered, ""Laodamas, why do you taunt me in this way? mymind is set rather on cares than contests; I have been throughinfinite trouble, and am come among you now as a suppliant, prayingyour king and people to further me on my return home.""

ííííThen Euryalus reviled him outright and said, ""I gather, then, thatyou are unskilled in any of the many sports that men generally delightin. I suppose you are one of those grasping traders that go about inships as captains or merchants, and who think of nothing but oftheir outward freights and homeward cargoes. There does not seem to bemuch of the athlete about you.""

íííí""For shame, Sir,"" answered Ulysses, fiercely, ""you are an insolentfellow- so true is it that the gods do not grace all men alike inspeech, person, and understanding. One man may be of weak presence,but heaven has adorned this with such a good conversation that hecharms every one who sees him; his honeyed moderation carries hishearers with him so that he is leader in all assemblies of hisfellows, and wherever he goes he is looked up to. Another may be ashandsome as a god, but his good looks are not crowned with discretion.This is your case. No god could make a finer looking fellow than youare, but you are a fool. Your ill-judged remarks have made meexceedingly angry, and you are quite mistaken, for I excel in agreat many athletic exercises; indeed, so long as I had youth andstrength, I was among the first athletes of the age. Now, however, Iam worn out by labour and sorrow, for I have gone through much both onthe field of battle and by the waves of the weary sea; still, in spiteof all this I will compete, for your taunts have stung me to thequick.""

ííííSo he hurried up without even taking his cloak off, and seized adisc, larger, more massive and much heavier than those used by thePhaeacians when disc-throwing among themselves. Then, swinging itback, he threw it from his brawny hand, and it made a humming sound inthe air as he did so. The Phaeacians quailed beneath the rushing ofits flight as it sped gracefully from his hand, and flew beyond anymark that had been made yet. Minerva, in the form of a man, came andmarked the place where it had fallen. ""A blind man, Sir,"" said she,""could easily tell your mark by groping for it- it is so far aheadof any other. You may make your mind easy about this contest, for noPhaeacian can come near to such a throw as yours.""

ííííUlysses was glad when he found he had a friend among the lookers-on,so he began to speak more pleasantly. ""Young men,"" said he, ""come upto that throw if you can, and I will throw another disc as heavy oreven heavier. If anyone wants to have a bout with me let him comeon, for I am exceedingly angry; I will box, wrestle, or run, I donot care what it is, with any man of you all except Laodamas, butnot with him because I am his guest, and one cannot compete with one'sown personal friend. At least I do not think it a prudent or asensible thing for a guest to challenge his host's family at any game,especially when he is in a foreign country. He will cut the groundfrom under his own feet if he does; but I make no exception as regardsany one else, for I want to have the matter out and know which isthe best man. I am a good hand at every kind of athletic sport knownamong mankind. I am an excellent archer. In battle I am always thefirst to bring a man down with my arrow, no matter how many more aretaking aim at him alongside of me. Philoctetes was the only man whocould shoot better than I could when we Achaeans were before Troyand in practice. I far excel every one else in the whole world, ofthose who still eat bread upon the face of the earth, but I should notlike to shoot against the mighty dead, such as Hercules, or Eurytusthe Cechalian-men who could shoot against the gods themselves. This infact was how Eurytus came prematurely by his end, for Apollo was angrywith him and killed him because he challenged him as an archer. Ican throw a dart farther than any one else can shoot an arrow. Runningis the only point in respect of which I am afraid some of thePhaecians might beat me, for I have been brought down very low at sea;my provisions ran short, and therefore I am still weak.""

ííííThey all held their peace except King Alcinous, who began, ""Sir,we have had much pleasure in hearing all that you have told us, fromwhich I understand that you are willing to show your prowess, ashaving been displeased with some insolent remarks that have beenmade to you by one of our athletes, and which could never have beenuttered by any one who knows how to talk with propriety. I hope youwill apprehend my meaning, and will explain to any be one of yourchief men who may be dining with yourself and your family when you gethome, that we have an hereditary aptitude for accomplishments of allkinds. We are not particularly remarkable for our boxing, nor yet aswrestlers, but we are singularly fleet of foot and are excellentsailors. We are extremely fond of good dinners, music, and dancing; wealso like frequent changes of linen, warm baths, and good beds, sonow, please, some of you who are the best dancers set about dancing,that our guest on his return home may be able to tell his friendshow much we surpass all other nations as sailors, runners, dancers,minstrels. Demodocus has left his lyre at my house, so run some one orother of you and fetch it for him.""

ííííOn this a servant hurried off to bring the lyre from the king'shouse, and the nine men who had been chosen as stewards stood forward.It was their business to manage everything connected with thesports, so they made the ground smooth and marked a wide space for thedancers. Presently the servant came back with Demodocus's lyre, and hetook his place in the midst of them, whereon the best young dancers inthe town began to foot and trip it so nimbly that Ulysses wasdelighted with the merry twinkling of their feet.

ííííMeanwhile the bard began to sing the loves of Mars and Venus, andhow they first began their intrigue in the house of Vulcan. Marsmade Venus many presents, and defiled King Vulcan's marriage bed, sothe sun, who saw what they were about, told Vulcan. Vulcan was veryangry when he heard such dreadful news, so he went to his smithybrooding mischief, got his great anvil into its place, and began toforge some chains which none could either unloose or break, so thatthey might stay there in that place. When he had finished his snare hewent into his bedroom and festooned the bed-posts all over with chainslike cobwebs; he also let many hang down from the great beam of theceiling. Not even a god could see them, so fine and subtle werethey. As soon as he had spread the chains all over the bed, he made asthough he were setting out for the fair state of Lemnos, which ofall places in the world was the one he was most fond of. But Mars keptno blind look out, and as soon as he saw him start, hurried off to hishouse, burning with love for Venus.

ííííNow Venus was just come in from a visit to her father Jove, andwas about sitting down when Mars came inside the house, an said ashe took her hand in his own, ""Let us go to the couch of Vulcan: heis not at home, but is gone off to Lemnos among the Sintians, whosespeech is barbarous.""

ííííShe was nothing loth, so they went to the couch to take theirrest, whereon they were caught in the toils which cunning Vulcan hadspread for them, and could neither get up nor stir hand or foot, butfound too late that they were in a trap. Then Vulcan came up tothem, for he had turned back before reaching Lemnos, when his scoutthe sun told him what was going on. He was in a furious passion, andstood in the vestibule making a dreadful noise as he shouted to allthe gods.

íííí""Father Jove,"" he cried, ""and all you other blessed gods who livefor ever, come here and see the ridiculous and disgraceful sightthat I will show you. Jove's daughter Venus is always dishonouringme because I am lame. She is in love with Mars, who is handsome andclean built, whereas I am a cripple- but my parents are to blame forthat, not I; they ought never to have begotten me. Come and see thepair together asleep on my bed. It makes me furious to look at them.They are very fond of one another, but I do not think they will liethere longer than they can help, nor do I think that they will sleepmuch; there, however, they shall stay till her father has repaid methe sum I gave him for his baggage of a daughter, who is fair butnot honest.""

ííííOn this the gods gathered to the house of Vulcan. Earth-encirclingNeptune came, and Mercury the bringer of luck, and King Apollo, butthe goddesses stayed at home all of them for shame. Then the givers ofall good things stood in the doorway, and the blessed gods roared withinextinguishable laughter, as they saw how cunning Vulcan had been,whereon one would turn towards his neighbour saying:

íííí""Ill deeds do not prosper, and the weak confound the strong. See howlimping Vulcan, lame as he is, has caught Mars who is the fleetest godin heaven; and now Mars will be cast in heavy damages.""

ííííThus did they converse, but King Apollo said to Mercury,""Messenger Mercury, giver of good things, you would not care howstrong the chains were, would you, if you could sleep with Venus?""

íííí""King Apollo,"" answered Mercury, ""I only wish I might get thechance, though there were three times as many chains- and you mightlook on, all of you, gods and goddesses, but would sleep with her if Icould.""

ííííThe immortal gods burst out laughing as they heard him, butNeptune took it all seriously, and kept on imploring Vulcan to setMars free again. ""Let him go,"" he cried, ""and I will undertake, as yourequire, that he shall pay you all the damages that are heldreasonable among the immortal gods.""

íííí""Do not,"" replied Vulcan, ""ask me to do this; a bad man's bond isbad security; what remedy could I enforce against you if Mars shouldgo away and leave his debts behind him along with his chains?""

íííí""Vulcan,"" said Neptune, ""if Mars goes away without paying hisdamages, I will pay you myself."" So Vulcan answered, ""In this case Icannot and must not refuse you.""

ííííThereon he loosed the bonds that bound them, and as soon as theywere free they scampered off, Mars to Thrace and laughter-loving Venusto Cyprus and to Paphos, where is her grove and her altar fragrantwith burnt offerings. Here the Graces hathed her, and anointed herwith oil of ambrosia such as the immortal gods make use of, and theyclothed her in raiment of the most enchanting beauty.

ííííThus sang the bard, and both Ulysses and the seafaring Phaeacianswere charmed as they heard him.

ííííThen Alcinous told Laodamas and Halius to dance alone, for there wasno one to compete with them. So they took a red ball which Polybus hadmade for them, and one of them bent himself backwards and threw itup towards the clouds, while the other jumped from off the groundand caught it with ease before it came down again. When they haddone throwing the ball straight up into the air they began to dance,and at the same time kept on throwing it backwards and forwards to oneanother, while all the young men in the ring applauded and made agreat stamping with their feet. Then Ulysses said:

íííí""King Alcinous, you said your people were the nimblest dancers inthe world, and indeed they have proved themselves to be so. I wasastonished as I saw them.""

ííííThe king was delighted at this, and exclaimed to the Phaecians""Aldermen and town councillors, our guest seems to be a person ofsingular judgement; let us give him such proof of our hospitality ashe may reasonably expect. There are twelve chief men among you, andcounting myself there are thirteen; contribute, each of you, a cleancloak, a shirt, and a talent of fine gold; let us give him all this ina lump down at once, so that when he gets his supper he may do so witha light heart. As for Euryalus he will have to make a formal apologyand a present too, for he has been rude.""

ííííThus did he speak. The others all of them applauded his saying,and sent their servants to fetch the presents. Then Euryalus said,""King Alcinous, I will give the stranger all the satisfaction yourequire. He shall have sword, which is of bronze, all but the hilt,which is of silver. I will also give him the scabbard of newly sawnivory into which it fits. It will be worth a great deal to him.""

ííííAs he spoke he placed the sword in the hands of Ulysses and said,""Good luck to you, father stranger; if anything has been said amissmay the winds blow it away with them, and may heaven grant you asafe return, for I understand you have been long away from home, andhave gone through much hardship.""

ííííTo which Ulysses answered, ""Good luck to you too my friend, andmay the gods grant you every happiness. I hope you will not miss thesword you have given me along with your apology.""

ííííWith these words he girded the sword about his shoulders and towardssundown the presents began to make their appearance, as the servantsof the donors kept bringing them to the house of King Alcinous; herehis sons received them, and placed them under their mother's charge.Then Alcinous led the way to the house and bade his guests taketheir seats.

íííí""Wife,"" said he, turning to Queen Arete, ""Go, fetch the best chestwe have, and put a clean cloak and shirt in it. Also, set a copperon the fire and heat some water; our guest will take a warm bath;see also to the careful packing of the presents that the noblePhaeacians have made him; he will thus better enjoy both his supperand the singing that will follow. I shall myself give him thisgolden goblet- which is of exquisite workmanship- that he may bereminded of me for the rest of his life whenever he makes adrink-offering to Jove, or to any of the gods.""

ííííThen Arete told her maids to set a large tripod upon the fire asfast as they could, whereon they set a tripod full of bath water on toa clear fire; they threw on sticks to make it blaze, and the waterbecame hot as the flame played about the belly of the tripod.Meanwhile Arete brought a magnificent chest her own room, and insideit she packed all the beautiful presents of gold and raiment which thePhaeacians had brought. Lastly she added a cloak and a good shirt fromAlcinous, and said to Ulysses:

íííí""See to the lid yourself, and have the whole bound round at once,for fear any one should rob you by the way when you are asleep in yourship.""

ííííWhen Ulysses heard this he put the lid on the chest and made it fastwith a bond that Circe had taught him. He had done so before anupper servant told him to come to the bath and wash himself. He wasvery glad of a warm bath, for he had had no one to wait upon himever since he left the house of Calypso, who as long as he remainedwith her had taken as good care of him as though he had been a god.When the servants had done washing and anointing him with oil, and hadgiven him a clean cloak and shirt, he left the bath room and joinedthe guests who were sitting over their wine. Lovely Nausicaa stoodby one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof if the cloister, andadmired him as she saw him pass. ""Farewell stranger,"" said she, ""donot forget me when you are safe at home again, for it is to me firstthat you owe a ransom for having saved your life.""

ííííAnd Ulysses said, ""Nausicaa, daughter of great Alcinous, may Jovethe mighty husband of Juno, grant that I may reach my home; so shall Ibless you as my guardian angel all my days, for it was you who savedme.""

ííííWhen he had said this, he seated himself beside Alcinous. Supper wasthen served, and the wine was mixed for drinking. A servant led in thefavourite bard Demodocus, and set him in the midst of the company,near one of the bearing-posts supporting the cloister, that he mightlean against it. Then Ulysses cut off a piece of roast pork withplenty of fat (for there was abundance left on the joint) and saidto a servant, ""Take this piece of pork over to Demodocus and tellhim to eat it; for all the pain his lays may cause me I will salutehim none the less; bards are honoured and respected throughout theworld, for the muse teaches them their songs and loves them.""

ííííThe servant carried the pork in his fingers over to Demodocus, whotook it and was very much pleased. They then laid their hands on thegood things that were before them, and as soon as they had had toeat and drink, Ulysses said to Demodocus, ""Demodocus, there is noone in the world whom I admire more than I do you. You must havestudied under the Muse, Jove's daughter, and under Apollo, soaccurately do you sing the return of the Achaeans with all theirsufferings and adventures. If you were not there yourself, you musthave heard it all from some one who was. Now, however, change yoursong and tell us of the wooden horse which Epeus made with theassistance of Minerva, and which Ulysses got by stratagem into thefort of Troy after freighting it with the men who afterwards sackedthe city. If you will sing this tale aright I will tell all theworld how magnificently heaven has endowed you.""

ííííThe bard inspired of heaven took up the story at the point wheresome of the Argives set fire to their tents and sailed away whileothers, hidden within the horse, were waiting with Ulysses in theTrojan place of assembly. For the Trojans themselves had drawn thehorse into their fortress, and it stood there while they sat incouncil round it, and were in three minds as to what they should do.Some were for breaking it up then and there; others would have itdragged to the top of the rock on which the fortress stood, and thenthrown down the precipice; while yet others were for letting it remainas an offering and propitiation for the gods. And this was how theysettled it in the end, for the city was doomed when it took in thathorse, within which were all the bravest of the Argives waiting tobring death and destruction on the Trojans. Anon he sang how thesons of the Achaeans issued from the horse, and sacked the town,breaking out from their ambuscade. He sang how they over ran thecity hither and thither and ravaged it, and how Ulysses went raginglike Mars along with Menelaus to the house of Deiphobus. It wasthere that the fight raged most furiously, nevertheless by Minerva'shelp he was victorious.

ííííAll this he told, but Ulysses was overcome as he heard him, andhis cheeks were wet with tears. He wept as a woman weeps when shethrows herself on the body of her husband who has fallen before hisown city and people, fighting bravely in defence of his home andchildren. She screams aloud and flings her arms about him as he liesgasping for breath and dying, but her enemies beat her from behindabout the back and shoulders, and carry her off into slavery, to alife of labour and sorrow, and the beauty fades from her cheeks-even so piteously did Ulysses weep, but none of those presentperceived his tears except Alcinous, who was sitting near him, andcould hear the sobs and sighs that he was heaving. The king,therefore, at once rose and said:

íííí""Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, let Demodocuscease his song, for there are those present who do not seem to likeit. From the moment that we had done supper and Demodocus began tosing, our guest has been all the time groaning and lamenting. He isevidently in great trouble, so let the bard leave off, that we may allenjoy ourselves, hosts and guest alike. This will be much more as itshould be, for all these festivities, with the escort and the presentsthat we are making with so much good will, are wholly in his honour,and any one with even a moderate amount of right feeling knows that heought to treat a guest and a suppliant as though he were his ownbrother.

íííí""Therefore, Sir, do you on your part affect no more concealmentnor reserve in the matter about which I shall ask you; it will be morepolite in you to give me a plain answer; tell me the name by whichyour father and mother over yonder used to call you, and by whichyou were known among your neighbours and fellow-citizens. There isno one, neither rich nor poor, who is absolutely without any namewhatever, for people's fathers and mothers give them names as soonas they are born. Tell me also your country, nation, and city, thatour ships may shape their purpose accordingly and take you there.For the Phaeacians have no pilots; their vessels have no rudders asthose of other nations have, but the ships themselves understandwhat it is that we are thinking about and want; they know all thecities and countries in the whole world, and can traverse the sea justas well even when it is covered with mist and cloud, so that thereis no danger of being wrecked or coming to any harm. Still I doremember hearing my father say that Neptune was angry with us forbeing too easy-going in the matter of giving people escorts. He saidthat one of these days he should wreck a ship of ours as it wasreturning from having escorted some one, and bury our city under ahigh mountain. This is what my used to say, but whether the god willcarry out his threat or no is a matter which he will decide forhimself.

íííí""And now, tell me and tell me true. Where have you been wandering,and in what countries have you travelled? Tell us of the peoplesthemselves, and of their cities- who were hostile, savage anduncivilized, and who, on the other hand, hospitable and humane. Tellus also why you are made unhappy on hearing about the return of theArgive Danaans from Troy. The gods arranged all this, and sent themtheir misfortunes in order that future generations might havesomething to sing about. Did you lose some brave kinsman of yourwife's when you were before Troy? a son-in-law or father-in-law- whichare the nearest relations a man has outside his own flesh and blood?or was it some brave and kindly-natured comrade- for a good friendis as dear to a man as his own brother?""

ííííBOOK IX.

ííííAND ULYSSES answered, ""King Alcinous, it is a good thing to hear abard with such a divine voice as this man has. There is nothing betteror more delightful than when a whole people make merry together,with the guests sitting orderly to listen, while the table is loadedwith bread and meats, and the cup-bearer draws wine and fills hiscup for every man. This is indeed as fair a sight as a man can see.Now, however, since you are inclined to ask the story of my sorrows,and rekindle my own sad memories in respect of them, I do not know howto begin, nor yet how to continue and conclude my tale, for the handof heaven has been laid heavily upon me.

íííí""Firstly, then, I will tell you my name that you too may know it,and one day, if I outlive this time of sorrow, may become my thereguests though I live so far away from all of you. I am Ulysses sonof Laertes, reknowned among mankind for all manner of subtlety, sothat my fame ascends to heaven. I live in Ithaca, where there is ahigh mountain called Neritum, covered with forests; and not far fromit there is a group of islands very near to one another- Dulichium,Same, and the wooded island of Zacynthus. It lies squat on thehorizon, all highest up in the sea towards the sunset, while theothers lie away from it towards dawn. It is a rugged island, but itbreeds brave men, and my eyes know none that they better love tolook upon. The goddess Calypso kept me with her in her cave, andwanted me to marry her, as did also the cunning Aeaean goddessCirce; but they could neither of them persuade me, for there isnothing dearer to a man than his own country and his parents, andhowever splendid a home he may have in a foreign country, if it be farfrom father or mother, he does not care about it. Now, however, I willtell you of the many hazardous adventures which by Jove's will I metwith on my return from Troy.

íííí""When I had set sail thence the wind took me first to Ismarus, whichis the city of the Cicons. There I sacked the town and put thepeople to the sword. We took their wives and also much booty, which wedivided equitably amongst us, so that none might have reason tocomplain. I then said that we had better make off at once, but mymen very foolishly would not obey me, so they stayed there drinkingmuch wine and killing great numbers of sheep and oxen on the seashore. Meanwhile the Cicons cried out for help to other Cicons wholived inland. These were more in number, and stronger, and they weremore skilled in the art of war, for they could fight, either fromchariots or on foot as the occasion served; in the morning, therefore,they came as thick as leaves and bloom in summer, and the hand ofheaven was against us, so that we were hard pressed. They set thebattle in array near the ships, and the hosts aimed theirbronze-shod spears at one another. So long as the day waxed and it wasstill morning, we held our own against them, though they were morein number than we; but as the sun went down, towards the time when menloose their oxen, the Cicons got the better of us, and we lost halfa dozen men from every ship we had; so we got away with those thatwere left.

íííí""Thence we sailed onward with sorrow in our hearts, but glad to haveescaped death though we had lost our comrades, nor did we leave tillwe had thrice invoked each one of the poor fellows who had perished bythe hands of the Cicons. Then Jove raised the North wind against ustill it blew a hurricane, so that land and sky were hidden in thickclouds, and night sprang forth out of the heavens. We let the shipsrun before the gale, but the force of the wind tore our sails totatters, so we took them down for fear of shipwreck, and rowed ourhardest towards the land. There we lay two days and two nightssuffering much alike from toil and distress of mind, but on themorning of the third day we again raised our masts, set sail, and tookour places, letting the wind and steersmen direct our ship. I shouldhave got home at that time unharmed had not the North wind and thecurrents been against me as I was doubling Cape Malea, and set meoff my course hard by the island of Cythera.

íííí""I was driven thence by foul winds for a space of nine days upon thesea, but on the tenth day we reached the land of the Lotus-eater,who live on a food that comes from a kind of flower. Here we landed totake in fresh water, and our crews got their mid-day meal on the shorenear the ships. When they had eaten and drunk I sent two of my companyto see what manner of men the people of the place might be, and theyhad a third man under them. They started at once, and went about amongthe Lotus-eaters, who did them no hurt, but gave them to eat of thelotus, which was so delicious that those who ate of it left off caringabout home, and did not even want to go back and say what had happenedto them, but were for staying and munching lotus with theLotus-eater without thinking further of their return; nevertheless,though they wept bitterly I forced them back to the ships and madethem fast under the benches. Then I told the rest to go on board atonce, lest any of them should taste of the lotus and leave off wantingto get home, so they took their places and smote the grey sea withtheir oars.

íííí""We sailed hence, always in much distress, till we came to theland of the lawless and inhuman Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes neitherplant nor plough, but trust in providence, and live on such wheat,barley, and grapes as grow wild without any kind of tillage, and theirwild grapes yield them wine as the sun and the rain may grow them.They have no laws nor assemblies of the people, but live in caves onthe tops of high mountains; each is lord and master in his family, andthey take no account of their neighbours.

íííí""Now off their harbour there lies a wooded and fertile island notquite close to the land of the Cyclopes, but still not far. It isoverrun with wild goats, that breed there in great numbers and arenever disturbed by foot of man; for sportsmen- who as a rule willsuffer so much hardship in forest or among mountain precipices- do notgo there, nor yet again is it ever ploughed or fed down, but it lies awilderness untilled and unsown from year to year, and has no livingthing upon it but only goats. For the Cyclopes have no ships, noryet shipwrights who could make ships for them; they cannot thereforego from city to city, or sail over the sea to one another's country aspeople who have ships can do; if they had had these they would havecolonized the island, for it is a very good one, and would yieldeverything in due season. There are meadows that in some places comeright down to the sea shore, well watered and full of lusciousgrass; grapes would do there excellently; there is level land forploughing, and it would always yield heavily at harvest time, forthe soil is deep. There is a good harbour where no cables arewanted, nor yet anchors, nor need a ship be moored, but all one has todo is to beach one's vessel and stay there till the wind becomesfair for putting out to sea again. At the head of the harbour there isa spring of clear water coming out of a cave, and there are poplarsgrowing all round it.

íííí""Here we entered, but so dark was the night that some god musthave brought us in, for there was nothing whatever to be seen. A thickmist hung all round our ships; the moon was hidden behind a mass ofclouds so that no one could have seen the island if he had lookedfor it, nor were there any breakers to tell us we were close inshore before we found ourselves upon the land itself; when, however,we had beached the ships, we took down the sails, went ashore andcamped upon the beach till daybreak.

íííí""When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, we admiredthe island and wandered all over it, while the nymphs Jove's daughtersroused the wild goats that we might get some meat for our dinner. Onthis we fetched our spears and bows and arrows from the ships, anddividing ourselves into three bands began to shoot the goats. Heavensent us excellent sport; I had twelve ships with me, and each ship gotnine goats, while my own ship had ten; thus through the livelong dayto the going down of the sun we ate and drank our fill,- and we hadplenty of wine left, for each one of us had taken many jars fullwhen we sacked the city of the Cicons, and this had not yet run out.While we were feasting we kept turning our eyes towards the land ofthe Cyclopes, which was hard by, and saw the smoke of their stubblefires. We could almost fancy we heard their voices and the bleating oftheir sheep and goats, but when the sun went down and it came on dark,we camped down upon the beach, and next morning I called a council.

íííí""'Stay here, my brave fellows,' said I, 'all the rest of you,while I go with my ship and exploit these people myself: I want to seeif they are uncivilized savages, or a hospitable and humane race.'

íííí""I went on board, bidding my men to do so also and loose thehawsers; so they took their places and smote the grey sea with theiroars. When we got to the land, which was not far, there, on the faceof a cliff near the sea, we saw a great cave overhung with laurels. Itwas a station for a great many sheep and goats, and outside therewas a large yard, with a high wall round it made of stones builtinto the ground and of trees both pine and oak. This was the abodeof a huge monster who was then away from home shepherding hisflocks. He would have nothing to do with other people, but led thelife of an outlaw. He was a horrid creature, not like a human being atall, but resembling rather some crag that stands out boldly againstthe sky on the top of a high mountain.

íííí""I told my men to draw the ship ashore, and stay where they were,all but the twelve best among them, who were to go along withmyself. I also took a goatskin of sweet black wine which had beengiven me by Maron, Apollo son of Euanthes, who was priest of Apollothe patron god of Ismarus, and lived within the wooded precincts ofthe temple. When we were sacking the city we respected him, and sparedhis life, as also his wife and child; so he made me some presents ofgreat value- seven talents of fine gold, and a bowl of silver, withtwelve jars of sweet wine, unblended, and of the most exquisiteflavour. Not a man nor maid in the house knew about it, but onlyhimself, his wife, and one housekeeper: when he drank it he mixedtwenty parts of water to one of wine, and yet the fragrance from themixing-bowl was so exquisite that it was impossible to refrain fromdrinking. I filled a large skin with this wine, and took a wallet fullof provisions with me, for my mind misgave me that I might have todeal with some savage who would be of great strength, and wouldrespect neither right nor law.

íííí""We soon reached his cave, but he was out shepherding, so we wentinside and took stock of all that we could see. His cheese-rackswere loaded with cheeses, and he had more lambs and kids than his penscould hold. They were kept in separate flocks; first there were thehoggets, then the oldest of the younger lambs and lastly the veryyoung ones all kept apart from one another; as for his dairy, allthe vessels, bowls, and milk pails into which he milked, were swimmingwith whey. When they saw all this, my men begged me to let themfirst steal some cheeses, and make off with them to the ship; theywould then return, drive down the lambs and kids, put them on boardand sail away with them. It would have been indeed better if we haddone so but I would not listen to them, for I wanted to see theowner himself, in the hope that he might give me a present. When,however, we saw him my poor men found him ill to deal with.

íííí""We lit a fire, offered some of the cheeses in sacrifice, ate othersof them, and then sat waiting till the Cyclops should come in with hissheep. When he came, he brought in with him a huge load of dryfirewood to light the fire for his supper, and this he flung with sucha noise on to the floor of his cave that we hid ourselves for fearat the far end of the cavern. Meanwhile he drove all the ewesinside, as well as the she-goats that he was going to milk, leavingthe males, both rams and he-goats, outside in the yards. Then herolled a huge stone to the mouth of the cave- so huge that two andtwenty strong four-wheeled waggons would not be enough to draw it fromits place against the doorway. When he had so done he sat down andmilked his ewes and goats, all in due course, and then let each ofthem have her own young. He curdled half the milk and set it asidein wicker strainers, but the other half he poured into bowls that hemight drink it for his supper. When he had got through with all hiswork, he lit the fire, and then caught sight of us, whereon he said:

íííí""'Strangers, who are you? Where do sail from? Are you traders, or doyou sail the as rovers, with your hands against every man, and everyman's hand against you?'

íííí""We were frightened out of our senses by his loud voice andmonstrous form, but I managed to say, 'We are Achaeans on our way homefrom Troy, but by the will of Jove, and stress of weather, we havebeen driven far out of our course. We are the people of Agamemnon, sonof Atreus, who has won infinite renown throughout the whole world,by sacking so great a city and killing so many people. We thereforehumbly pray you to show us some hospitality, and otherwise make ussuch presents as visitors may reasonably expect. May your excellencyfear the wrath of heaven, for we are your suppliants, and Jove takesall respectable travellers under his protection, for he is the avengerof all suppliants and foreigners in distress.'

íííí""To this he gave me but a pitiless answer, 'Stranger,' said he, 'youare a fool, or else you know nothing of this country. Talk to me,indeed, about fearing the gods or shunning their anger? We Cyclopes donot care about Jove or any of your blessed gods, for we are ever somuch stronger than they. I shall not spare either yourself or yourcompanions out of any regard for Jove, unless I am in the humour fordoing so. And now tell me where you made your ship fast when youcame on shore. Was it round the point, or is she lying straight offthe land?'

íííí""He said this to draw me out, but I was too cunning to be caughtin that way, so I answered with a lie; 'Neptune,' said I, 'sent myship on to the rocks at the far end of your country, and wrecked it.We were driven on to them from the open sea, but I and those who arewith me escaped the jaws of death.'

íííí""The cruel wretch vouchsafed me not one word of answer, but with asudden clutch he gripped up two of my men at once and dashed them downupon the ground as though they had been puppies. Their brains wereshed upon the ground, and the earth was wet with their blood. Thenhe tore them limb from limb and supped upon them. He gobbled them uplike a lion in the wilderness, flesh, bones, marrow, and entrails,without leaving anything uneaten. As for us, we wept and lifted up ourhands to heaven on seeing such a horrid sight, for we did not knowwhat else to do; but when the Cyclops had filled his huge paunch,and had washed down his meal of human flesh with a drink of neat milk,he stretched himself full length upon the ground among his sheep,and went to sleep. I was at first inclined to seize my sword, draw it,and drive it into his vitals, but I reflected that if I did weshould all certainly be lost, for we should never be able to shift thestone which the monster had put in front of the door. So we stayedsobbing and sighing where we were till morning came.

íííí""When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, he againlit his fire, milked his goats and ewes, all quite rightly, and thenlet each have her own young one; as soon as he had got through withall his work, he clutched up two more of my men, and began eating themfor his morning's meal. Presently, with the utmost ease, he rolled thestone away from the door and drove out his sheep, but he at once putit back again- as easily as though he were merely clapping the lidon to a quiver full of arrows. As soon as he had done so he shouted,and cried 'Shoo, shoo,' after his sheep to drive them on to themountain; so I was left to scheme some way of taking my revenge andcovering myself with glory.

íííí""In the end I deemed it would be the best plan to do as follows. TheCyclops had a great club which was lying near one of the sheep pens;it was of green olive wood, and he had cut it intending to use itfor a staff as soon as it should be dry. It was so huge that wecould only compare it to the mast of a twenty-oared merchant vessel oflarge burden, and able to venture out into open sea. I went up to thisclub and cut off about six feet of it; I then gave this piece to themen and told them to fine it evenly off at one end, which theyproceeded to do, and lastly I brought it to a point myself, charringthe end in the fire to make it harder. When I had done this I hid itunder dung, which was lying about all over the cave, and told themen to cast lots which of them should venture along with myself tolift it and bore it into the monster's eye while he was asleep. Thelot fell upon the very four whom I should have chosen, and I myselfmade five. In the evening the wretch came back from shepherding, anddrove his flocks into the cave- this time driving them all inside, andnot leaving any in the yards; I suppose some fancy must have takenhim, or a god must have prompted him to do so. As soon as he had putthe stone back to its place against the door, he sat down, milkedhis ewes and his goats all quite rightly, and then let each have herown young one; when he had got through with all this work, hegripped up two more of my men, and made his supper off them. So I wentup to him with an ivy-wood bowl of black wine in my hands:

íííí""'Look here, Cyclops,' said I, you have been eating a great dealof man's flesh, so take this and drink some wine, that you may seewhat kind of liquor we had on board my ship. I was bringing it toyou as a drink-offering, in the hope that you would take compassionupon me and further me on my way home, whereas all you do is to goon ramping and raving most intolerably. You ought to be ashamedyourself; how can you expect people to come see you any more if youtreat them in this way?'

íííí""He then took the cup and drank. He was so delighted with thetaste of the wine that he begged me for another bowl full. 'Be sokind,' he said, 'as to give me some more, and tell me your name atonce. I want to make you a present that you will be glad to have. Wehave wine even in this country, for our soil grows grapes and thesun ripens them, but this drinks like nectar and ambrosia all in one.'

íííí""I then gave him some more; three times did I fill the bowl for him,and three times did he drain it without thought or heed; then, whenI saw that the wine had got into his head, I said to him asplausibly as I could: 'Cyclops, you ask my name and I will tell ityou; give me, therefore, the present you promised me; my name isNoman; this is what my father and mother and my friends have alwayscalled me.'

íííí""But the cruel wretch said, 'Then I will eat all Noman's comradesbefore Noman himself, and will keep Noman for the last. This is thepresent that I will make him.'

ííííAs he spoke he reeled, and fell sprawling face upwards on theground. His great neck hung heavily backwards and a deep sleep tookhold upon him. Presently he turned sick, and threw up both wine andthe gobbets of human flesh on which he had been gorging, for he wasvery drunk. Then I thrust the beam of wood far into the embers to heatit, and encouraged my men lest any of them should turnfaint-hearted. When the wood, green though it was, was about to blaze,I drew it out of the fire glowing with heat, and my men gathered roundme, for heaven had filled their hearts with courage. We drove thesharp end of the beam into the monster's eye, and bearing upon it withall my weight I kept turning it round and round as though I wereboring a hole in a ship's plank with an auger, which two men with awheel and strap can keep on turning as long as they choose. Eventhus did we bore the red hot beam into his eye, till the boiling bloodbubbled all over it as we worked it round and round, so that the steamfrom the burning eyeball scalded his eyelids and eyebrows, and theroots of the eye sputtered in the fire. As a blacksmith plunges an axeor hatchet into cold water to temper it- for it is this that givesstrength to the iron- and it makes a great hiss as he does so, eventhus did the Cyclops' eye hiss round the beam of olive wood, and hishideous yells made the cave ring again. We ran away in a fright, buthe plucked the beam all besmirched with gore from his eye, andhurled it from him in a frenzy of rage and pain, shouting as he did soto the other Cyclopes who lived on the bleak headlands near him; sothey gathered from all quarters round his cave when they heard himcrying, and asked what was the matter with him.

íííí""'What ails you, Polyphemus,' said they, 'that you make such anoise, breaking the stillness of the night, and preventing us frombeing able to sleep? Surely no man is carrying off your sheep?Surely no man is trying to kill you either by fraud or by force?

íííí""But Polyphemus shouted to them from inside the cave, 'Noman iskilling me by fraud! Noman is killing me by force!'

íííí""'Then,' said they, 'if no man is attacking you, you must be ill;when Jove makes people ill, there is no help for it, and you hadbetter pray to your father Neptune.'

íííí""Then they went away, and I laughed inwardly at the success of myclever stratagem, but the Cyclops, groaning and in an agony of pain,felt about with his hands till he found the stone and took it from thedoor; then he sat in the doorway and stretched his hands in front ofit to catch anyone going out with the sheep, for he thought I might befoolish enough to attempt this.

íííí""As for myself I kept on puzzling to think how I could best savemy own life and those of my companions; I schemed and schemed, asone who knows that his life depends upon it, for the danger was verygreat. In the end I deemed that this plan would be the best. Themale sheep were well grown, and carried a heavy black fleece, so Ibound them noiselessly in threes together, with some of the withies onwhich the wicked monster used to sleep. There was to be a man underthe middle sheep, and the two on either side were to cover him, sothat there were three sheep to each man. As for myself there was a ramfiner than any of the others, so I caught hold of him by the back,esconced myself in the thick wool under his belly, and flung onpatiently to his fleece, face upwards, keeping a firm hold on it allthe time.

íííí""Thus, then, did we wait in great fear of mind till morning came,but when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, themale sheep hurried out to feed, while the ewes remained bleating aboutthe pens waiting to be milked, for their udders were full to bursting;but their master in spite of all his pain felt the backs of all thesheep as they stood upright, without being sharp enough to find outthat the men were underneath their bellies. As the ram was goingout, last of all, heavy with its fleece and with the weight of mycrafty self; Polyphemus laid hold of it and said:

íííí""'My good ram, what is it that makes you the last to leave my cavethis morning? You are not wont to let the ewes go before you, but leadthe mob with a run whether to flowery mead or bubbling fountain, andare the first to come home again at night; but now you lag last ofall. Is it because you know your master has lost his eye, and aresorry because that wicked Noman and his horrid crew have got himdown in his drink and blinded him? But I will have his life yet. Ifyou could understand and talk, you would tell me where the wretch ishiding, and I would dash his brains upon the ground till they flew allover the cave. I should thus have some satisfaction for the harm athis no-good Noman has done me.'

íííí""As spoke he drove the ram outside, but when we were a little wayout from the cave and yards, I first got from under the ram's belly,and then freed my comrades; as for the sheep, which were very fat,by constantly heading them in the right direction we managed todrive them down to the ship. The crew rejoiced greatly at seeing thoseof us who had escaped death, but wept for the others whom theCyclops had killed. However, I made signs to them by nodding andfrowning that they were to hush their crying, and told them to get allthe sheep on board at once and put out to sea; so they went aboard,took their places, and smote the grey sea with their oars. Then,when I had got as far out as my voice would reach, I began to jeerat the Cyclops.

íííí""'Cyclops,' said I, 'you should have taken better measure of yourman before eating up his comrades in your cave. You wretch, eat upyour visitors in your own house? You might have known that your sinwould find you out, and now Jove and the other gods have punishedyou.'

íííí""He got more and more furious as he heard me, so he tore the topfrom off a high mountain, and flung it just in front of my ship sothat it was within a little of hitting the end of the rudder. Thesea quaked as the rock fell into it, and the wash of the wave itraised carried us back towards the mainland, and forced us towards theshore. But I snatched up a long pole and kept the ship off, makingsigns to my men by nodding my head, that they must row for theirlives, whereon they laid out with a will. When we had got twice as faras we were before, I was for jeering at the Cyclops again, but the menbegged and prayed of me to hold my tongue.

íííí""'Do not,' they exclaimed, 'be mad enough to provoke this savagecreature further; he has thrown one rock at us already which droveus back again to the mainland, and we made sure it had been thedeath of us; if he had then heard any further sound of voices he wouldhave pounded our heads and our ship's timbers into a jelly with therugged rocks he would have heaved at us, for he can throw them along way.'

íííí""But I would not listen to them, and shouted out to him in myrage, 'Cyclops, if any one asks you who it was that put your eye outand spoiled your beauty, say it was the valiant warrior Ulysses, sonof Laertes, who lives in Ithaca.'

íííí""On this he groaned, and cried out, 'Alas, alas, then the oldprophecy about me is coming true. There was a prophet here, at onetime, a man both brave and of great stature, Telemus son of Eurymus,who was an excellent seer, and did all the prophesying for theCyclopes till he grew old; he told me that all this would happen to mesome day, and said I should lose my sight by the hand of Ulysses. Ihave been all along expecting some one of imposing presence andsuperhuman strength, whereas he turns out to be a little insignificantweakling, who has managed to blind my eye by taking advantage of me inmy drink; come here, then, Ulysses, that I may make you presents toshow my hospitality, and urge Neptune to help you forward on yourjourney- for Neptune and I are father and son. He, if he so will,shall heal me, which no one else neither god nor man can do.'

íííí""Then I said, 'I wish I could be as sure of killing you outright andsending you down to the house of Hades, as I am that it will take morethan Neptune to cure that eye of yours.'

íííí""On this he lifted up his hands to the firmament of heaven andprayed, saying, 'Hear me, great Neptune; if I am indeed your owntrue-begotten son, grant that Ulysses may never reach his homealive; or if he must get back to his friends at last, let him do solate and in sore plight after losing all his men [let him reach hishome in another man's ship and find trouble in his house.']

íííí""Thus did he pray, and Neptune heard his prayer. Then he picked up arock much larger than the first, swung it aloft and hurled it withprodigious force. It fell just short of the ship, but was within alittle of hitting the end of the rudder. The sea quaked as the rockfell into it, and the wash of the wave it raised drove us onwards onour way towards the shore of the island.

íííí""When at last we got to the island where we had left the rest of ourships, we found our comrades lamenting us, and anxiously awaitingour return. We ran our vessel upon the sands and got out of her onto the sea shore; we also landed the Cyclops' sheep, and dividedthem equitably amongst us so that none might have reason tocomplain. As for the ram, my companions agreed that I should have itas an extra share; so I sacrificed it on the sea shore, and burned itsthigh bones to Jove, who is the lord of all. But he heeded not mysacrifice, and only thought how he might destroy my ships and mycomrades.

íííí""Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun wefeasted our fill on meat and drink, but when the sun went down andit came on dark, we camped upon the beach. When the child ofmorning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I bade my men on board andloose the hawsers. Then they took their places and smote the greysea with their oars; so we sailed on with sorrow in our hearts, butglad to have escaped death though we had lost our comrades.

ííííBOOK X.

ííííTHENCE we went on to the Aeoli island where lives Aeolus son ofHippotas, dear to the immortal gods. It is an island that floats (asit were) upon the sea, iron bound with a wall that girds it. Now,Aeolus has six daughters and six lusty sons, so he made the sons marrythe daughters, and they all live with their dear father and mother,feasting and enjoying every conceivable kind of luxury. All day longthe atmosphere of the house is loaded with the savour of roastingmeats till it groans again, yard and all; but by night they sleep ontheir well-made bedsteads, each with his own wife between theblankets. These were the people among whom we had now come.

íííí""Aeolus entertained me for a whole month asking me questions all thetime about Troy, the Argive fleet, and the return of the Achaeans. Itold him exactly how everything had happened, and when I said I mustgo, and asked him to further me on my way, he made no sort ofdifficulty, but set about doing so at once. Moreover, he flayed me aprime ox-hide to hold the ways of the roaring winds, which he shutup in the hide as in a sack- for Jove had made him captain over thewinds, and he could stir or still each one of them according to hisown pleasure. He put the sack in the ship and bound the mouth sotightly with a silver thread that not even a breath of a side-windcould blow from any quarter. The West wind which was fair for us didhe alone let blow as it chose; but it all came to nothing, for we werelost through our own folly.

íííí""Nine days and nine nights did we sail, and on the tenth day ournative land showed on the horizon. We got so close in that we couldsee the stubble fires burning, and I, being then dead beat, fellinto a light sleep, for I had never let the rudder out of my ownhands, that we might get home the faster. On this the men fell totalking among themselves, and said I was bringing back gold and silverin the sack that Aeolus had given me. 'Bless my heart,' would one turnto his neighbour, saying, 'how this man gets honoured and makesfriends to whatever city or country he may go. See what fine prizes heis taking home from Troy, while we, who have travelled just as faras he has, come back with hands as empty as we set out with- and nowAeolus has given him ever so much more. Quick- let us see what itall is, and how much gold and silver there is in the sack he gavehim.'

íííí""Thus they talked and evil counsels prevailed. They loosed the sack,whereupon the wind flew howling forth and raised a storm thatcarried us weeping out to sea and away from our own country. Then Iawoke, and knew not whether to throw myself into the sea or to live onand make the best of it; but I bore it, covered myself up, and laydown in the ship, while the men lamented bitterly as the fiercewinds bore our fleet back to the Aeolian island.

íííí""When we reached it we went ashore to take in water, and dinedhard by the ships. Immediately after dinner I took a herald and one ofmy men and went straight to the house of Aeolus, where I found himfeasting with his wife and family; so we sat down as suppliants on thethreshold. They were astounded when they saw us and said, 'Ulysses,what brings you here? What god has been ill-treating you? We tookgreat pains to further you on your way home to Ithaca, or whereverit was that you wanted to go to.'

íííí""Thus did they speak, but I answered sorrowfully, 'My men haveundone me; they, and cruel sleep, have ruined me. My friends, mendme this mischief, for you can if you will.'

íííí""I spoke as movingly as I could, but they said nothing, till theirfather answered, 'Vilest of mankind, get you gone at once out of theisland; him whom heaven hates will I in no wise help. Be off, foryou come here as one abhorred of heaven. ""And with these words he sentme sorrowing from his door.

íííí""Thence we sailed sadly on till the men were worn out with longand fruitless rowing, for there was no longer any wind to help them.Six days, night and day did we toil, and on the seventh day we reachedthe rocky stronghold of Lamus- Telepylus, the city of theLaestrygonians, where the shepherd who is driving in his sheep andgoats [to be milked] salutes him who is driving out his flock [tofeed] and this last answers the salute. In that country a man whocould do without sleep might earn double wages, one as a herdsman ofcattle, and another as a shepherd, for they work much the same bynight as they do by day.

íííí""When we reached the harbour we found it land-locked under steepcliffs, with a narrow entrance between two headlands. My captains tookall their ships inside, and made them fast close to one another, forthere was never so much as a breath of wind inside, but it wasalways dead calm. I kept my own ship outside, and moored it to arock at the very end of the point; then I climbed a high rock toreconnoitre, but could see no sign neither of man nor cattle, onlysome smoke rising from the ground. So I sent two of my company with anattendant to find out what sort of people the inhabitants were.

íííí""The men when they got on shore followed a level road by which thepeople draw their firewood from the mountains into the town, tillpresently they met a young woman who had come outside to fetchwater, and who was daughter to a Laestrygonian named Antiphates. Shewas going to the fountain Artacia from which the people bring in theirwater, and when my men had come close up to her, they asked her whothe king of that country might be, and over what kind of people heruled; so she directed them to her father's house, but when they gotthere they found his wife to be a giantess as huge as a mountain,and they were horrified at the sight of her.

íííí""She at once called her husband Antiphates from the place ofassembly, and forthwith he set about killing my men. He snatched upone of them, and began to make his dinner off him then and there,whereon the other two ran back to the ships as fast as ever theycould. But Antiphates raised a hue and cry after them, and thousandsof sturdy Laestrygonians sprang up from every quarter- ogres, not men.They threw vast rocks at us from the cliffs as though they had beenmere stones, and I heard the horrid sound of the ships crunching upagainst one another, and the death cries of my men, as theLaestrygonians speared them like fishes and took them home to eatthem. While they were thus killing my men within the harbour I drew mysword, cut the cable of my own ship, and told my men to row with alftheir might if they too would not fare like the rest; so they laid outfor their lives, and we were thankful enough when we got into openwater out of reach of the rocks they hurled at us. As for the othersthere was not one of them left.

íííí""Thence we sailed sadly on, glad to have escaped death, though wehad lost our comrades, and came to the Aeaean island, where Circelives a great and cunning goddess who is own sister to the magicianAeetes- for they are both children of the sun by Perse, who isdaughter to Oceanus. We brought our ship into a safe harbour without aword, for some god guided us thither, and having landed we there fortwo days and two nights, worn out in body and mind. When the morningof the third day came I took my spear and my sword, and went away fromthe ship to reconnoitre, and see if I could discover signs of humanhandiwork, or hear the sound of voices. Climbing to the top of ahigh look-out I espied the smoke of Circe's house rising upwardsamid a dense forest of trees, and when I saw this I doubted whether,having seen the smoke, I would not go on at once and find out more,but in the end I deemed it best to go back to the ship, give the mentheir dinners, and send some of them instead of going myself.

íííí""When I had nearly got back to the ship some god took pity upon mysolitude, and sent a fine antlered stag right into the middle of mypath. He was coming down his pasture in the forest to drink of theriver, for the heat of the sun drove him, and as he passed I struckhim in the middle of the back; the bronze point of the spear wentclean through him, and he lay groaning in the dust until the life wentout of him. Then I set my foot upon him, drew my spear from the wound,and laid it down; I also gathered rough grass and rushes and twistedthem into a fathom or so of good stout rope, with which I bound thefour feet of the noble creature together; having so done I hung himround my neck and walked back to the ship leaning upon my spear, forthe stag was much too big for me to be able to carry him on myshoulder, steadying him with one hand. As I threw him down in front ofthe ship, I called the men and spoke cheeringly man by man to eachof them. 'Look here my friends,' said I, 'we are not going to die somuch before our time after all, and at any rate we will not starveso long as we have got something to eat and drink on board.' On thisthey uncovered their heads upon the sea shore and admired the stag,for he was indeed a splendid fellow. Then, when they had feasted theireyes upon him sufficiently, they washed their hands and began tocook him for dinner.

íííí""Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun westayed there eating and drinking our fill, but when the sun wentdown and it came on dark, we camped upon the sea shore. When the childof morning, fingered Dawn, appeared, I called a council and said,'My friends, we are in very great difficulties; listen therefore tome. We have no idea where the sun either sets or rises, so that wedo not even know East from West. I see no way out of it; nevertheless,we must try and find one. We are certainly on an island, for I went ashigh as I could this morning, and saw the sea reaching all round it tothe horizon; it lies low, but towards the middle I saw smoke risingfrom out of a thick forest of trees.'

íííí""Their hearts sank as they heard me, for they remembered how theyhad been treated by the Laestrygonian Antiphates, and by the savageogre Polyphemus. They wept bitterly in their dismay, but there wasnothing to be got by crying, so I divided them into two companiesand set a captain over each; I gave one company to Eurylochus, while Itook command of the other myself. Then we cast lots in a helmet, andthe lot fell upon Eurylochus; so he set out with his twenty-two men,and they wept, as also did we who were left behind.

íííí""When they reached Circe's house they found it built of cutstones, on a site that could be seen from far, in the middle of theforest. There were wild mountain wolves and lions prowling all roundit- poor bewitched creatures whom she had tamed by her enchantmentsand drugged into subjection. They did not attack my men, but waggedtheir great tails, fawned upon them, and rubbed their noses lovinglyagainst them. As hounds crowd round their master when they see himcoming from dinner- for they know he will bring them something- evenso did these wolves and lions with their great claws fawn upon my men,but the men were terribly frightened at seeing such strange creatures.Presently they reached the gates of the goddess's house, and as theystood there they could hear Circe within, singing most beautifullyas she worked at her loom, making a web so fine, so soft, and ofsuch dazzling colours as no one but a goddess could weave. On thisPolites, whom I valued and trusted more than any other of my men,said, 'There is some one inside working at a loom and singing mostbeautifully; the whole place resounds with it, let us call her and seewhether she is woman or goddess.'

íííí""They called her and she came down, unfastened the door, and badethem enter. They, thinking no evil, followed her, all exceptEurylochus, who suspected mischief and stayed outside. When she hadgot them into her house, she set them upon benches and seats and mixedthem a mess with cheese, honey, meal, and Pramnian but she druggedit with wicked poisons to make them forget their homes, and whenthey had drunk she turned them into pigs by a stroke of her wand,and shut them up in her pigsties. They were like pigs-head, hair,and all, and they grunted just as pigs do; but their senses were thesame as before, and they remembered everything.

íííí""Thus then were they shut up squealing, and Circe threw them someacorns and beech masts such as pigs eat, but Eurylochus hurried backto tell me about the sad fate of our comrades. He was so overcome withdismay that though he tried to speak he could find no words to doso; his eyes filled with tears and he could only sob and sigh, till atlast we forced his story out of him, and he told us what hadhappened to the others.

íííí""'We went,' said he, as you told us, through the forest, and inthe middle of it there was a fine house built with cut stones in aplace that could be seen from far. There we found a woman, or else shewas a goddess, working at her loom and singing sweetly; so the menshouted to her and called her, whereon she at once came down, openedthe door, and invited us in. The others did not suspect any mischiefso they followed her into the house, but I stayed where I was, for Ithought there might be some treachery. From that moment I saw themno more, for not one of them ever came out, though I sat a long timewatching for them.'

íííí""Then I took my sword of bronze and slung it over my shoulders; Ialso took my bow, and told Eurylochus to come back with me and show methe way. But he laid hold of me with both his hands and spokepiteously, saying, 'Sir, do not force me to go with you, but let mestay here, for I know you will not bring one of them back with you,nor even return alive yourself; let us rather see if we cannotescape at any rate with the few that are left us, for we may stillsave our lives.'

íííí""'Stay where you are, then, 'answered I, 'eating and drinking at theship, but I must go, for I am most urgently bound to do so.'

íííí""With this I left the ship and went up inland. When I got throughthe charmed grove, and was near the great house of the enchantressCirce, I met Mercury with his golden wand, disguised as a young man inthe hey-day of his youth and beauty with the down just coming upon hisface. He came up to me and took my hand within his own, saying, 'Mypoor unhappy man, whither are you going over this mountain top,alone and without knowing the way? Your men are shut up in Circe'spigsties, like so many wild boars in their lairs. You surely do notfancy that you can set them free? I can tell you that you will neverget back and will have to stay there with the rest of them. Butnever mind, I will protect you and get you out of your difficulty.Take this herb, which is one of great virtue, and keep it about youwhen you go to Circe's house, it will be a talisman to you againstevery kind of mischief.

íííí""'And I will tell you of all the wicked witchcraft that Circe willtry to practise upon you. She will mix a mess for you to drink, andshe will drug the meal with which she makes it, but she will not beable to charm you, for the virtue of the herb that I shall give youwill prevent her spells from working. I will tell you all about it.When Circe strikes you with her wand, draw your sword and springupon her as though you were goings to kill her. She will then befrightened and will desire you to go to bed with her; on this you mustnot point blank refuse her, for you want her to set your companionsfree, and to take good care also of yourself, but you make her swearsolemnly by all the blessed that she will plot no further mischiefagainst you, or else when she has got you naked she will unman you andmake you fit for nothing.'

íííí""As he spoke he pulled the herb out of the ground an showed mewhat it was like. The root was black, while the flower was as white asmilk; the gods call it Moly, and mortal men cannot uproot it, butthe gods can do whatever they like.

íííí""Then Mercury went back to high Olympus passing over the woodedisland; but I fared onward to the house of Circe, and my heart wasclouded with care as I walked along. When I got to the gates I stoodthere and called the goddess, and as soon as she heard me she camedown, opened the door, and asked me to come in; so I followed her-much troubled in my mind. She set me on a richly decorated seat inlaidwith silver, there was a footstool also under my feet, and she mixed amess in a golden goblet for me to drink; but she drugged it, for shemeant me mischief. When she had given it me, and I had drunk itwithout its charming me, she struck she, struck me with her wand.'There now,' she cried, 'be off to the pigsty, and make your lair withthe rest of them.'

íííí""But I rushed at her with my sword drawn as though I would kill her,whereon she fell with a loud scream, clasped my knees, and spokepiteously, saying, 'Who and whence are you? from what place and peoplehave you come? How can it be that my drugs have no power to charm you?Never yet was any man able to stand so much as a taste of the herb Igave you; you must be spell-proof; surely you can be none other thanthe bold hero Ulysses, who Mercury always said would come here someday with his ship while on his way home form Troy; so be it then;sheathe your sword and let us go to bed, that we may make friendsand learn to trust each other.'

íííí""And I answered, 'Circe, how can you expect me to be friendly withyou when you have just been turning all my men into pigs? And now thatyou have got me here myself, you mean me mischief when you ask me togo to bed with you, and will unman me and make me fit for nothing. Ishall certainly not consent to go to bed with you unless you willfirst take your solemn oath to plot no further harm against me.'

íííí""So she swore at once as I had told her, and when she hadcompleted her oath then I went to bed with her.

íííí""Meanwhile her four servants, who are her housemaids, set abouttheir work. They are the children of the groves and fountains, andof the holy waters that run down into the sea. One of them spread afair purple cloth over a seat, and laid a carpet underneath it.Another brought tables of silver up to the seats, and set them withbaskets of gold. A third mixed some sweet wine with water in asilver bowl and put golden cups upon the tables, while the fourthshe brought in water and set it to boil in a large cauldron over agood fire which she had lighted. When the water in the cauldron wasboiling, she poured cold into it till it was just as I liked it, andthen she set me in a bath and began washing me from the cauldron aboutthe head and shoulders, to take the tire and stiffness out of mylimbs. As soon as she had done washing me and anointing me with oil,she arrayed me in a good cloak and shirt and led me to a richlydecorated seat inlaid with silver; there was a footstool also under myfeet. A maid servant then brought me water in a beautiful goldenewer and poured it into a silver basin for me to wash my hands, andshe drew a clean table beside me; an upper servant brought me breadand offered me many things of what there was in the house, and thenCirce bade me eat, but I would not, and sat without heeding what wasbefore me, still moody and suspicious.

íííí""When Circe saw me sitting there without eating, and in great grief,she came to me and said, 'Ulysses, why do you sit like that asthough you were dumb, gnawing at your own heart, and refusing bothmeat and drink? Is it that you are still suspicious? You ought notto be, for I have already sworn solemnly that I will not hurt you.'

íííí""And I said, 'Circe, no man with any sense of what is right canthink of either eating or drinking in your house until you have sethis friends free and let him see them. If you want me to eat anddrink, you must free my men and bring them to me that I may see themwith my own eyes.'

íííí""When I had said this she went straight through the court with herwand in her hand and opened the pigsty doors. My men came out likeso many prime hogs and stood looking at her, but she went aboutamong them and anointed each with a second drug, whereon thebristles that the bad drug had given them fell off, and they becamemen again, younger than they were before, and much taller and betterlooking. They knew me at once, seized me each of them by the hand, andwept for joy till the whole house was filled with the sound of theirhullabalooing, and Circe herself was so sorry for them that she cameup to me and said, 'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, go back at onceto the sea where you have left your ship, and first draw it on tothe land. Then, hide all your ship's gear and property in some cave,and come back here with your men.'

íííí""I agreed to this, so I went back to the sea shore, and found themen at the ship weeping and wailing most piteously. When they saw methe silly blubbering fellows began frisking round me as calves breakout and gambol round their mothers, when they see them coming hometo be milked after they have been feeding all day, and the homesteadresounds with their lowing. They seemed as glad to see me as thoughthey had got back to their own rugged Ithaca, where they had been bornand bred. 'Sir,' said the affectionate creatures, 'we are as glad tosee you back as though we had got safe home to Ithaca; but tell us allabout the fate of our comrades.'

íííí""I spoke comfortingly to them and said, 'We must draw our ship on tothe land, and hide the ship's gear with all our property in some cave;then come with me all of you as fast as you can to Circe's house,where you will find your comrades eating and drinking in the midstof great abundance.'

íííí""On this the men would have come with me at once, but Eurylochustried to hold them back and said, 'Alas, poor wretches that we are,what will become of us? Rush not on your ruin by going to the house ofCirce, who will turn us all into pigs or wolves or lions, and we shallhave to keep guard over her house. Remember how the Cyclops treated uswhen our comrades went inside his cave, and Ulysses with them. Itwas all through his sheer folly that those men lost their lives.'

íííí""When I heard him I was in two minds whether or no to draw thekeen blade that hung by my sturdy thigh and cut his head off inspite of his being a near relation of my own; but the men intercededfor him and said, 'Sir, if it may so be, let this fellow stay here andmind the ship, but take the rest of us with you to Circe's house.'

íííí""On this we all went inland, and Eurylochus was not left behindafter all, but came on too, for he was frightened by the severereprimand that I had given him.

íííí""Meanwhile Circe had been seeing that the men who had been leftbehind were washed and anointed with olive oil; she had also giventhem woollen cloaks and shirts, and when we came we found them allcomfortably at dinner in her house. As soon as the men saw eachother face to face and knew one another, they wept for joy and criedaloud till the whole palace rang again. Thereon Circe came up to meand said, 'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, tell your men to leave offcrying; I know how much you have all of you suffered at sea, and howill you have fared among cruel savages on the mainland, but that isover now, so stay here, and eat and drink till you are once more asstrong and hearty as you were when you left Ithaca; for at present youare weakened both in body and mind; you keep all the time thinkingof the hardships- you have suffered during your travels, so that youhave no more cheerfulness left in you.'

íííí""Thus did she speak and we assented. We stayed with Circe for awhole twelvemonth feasting upon an untold quantity both of meat andwine. But when the year had passed in the waning of moons and the longdays had come round, my men called me apart and said, 'Sir, it is timeyou began to think about going home, if so be you are to be sparedto see your house and native country at all.'

íííí""Thus did they speak and I assented. Thereon through the livelongday to the going down of the sun we feasted our fill on meat and wine,but when the sun went down and it came on dark the men laid themselvesdown to sleep in the covered cloisters. I, however, after I had gotinto bed with Circe, besought her by her knees, and the goddesslistened to what I had got to say. 'Circe,' said I, 'please to keepthe promise you made me about furthering me on my homeward voyage. Iwant to get back and so do my men, they are always pestering me withtheir complaints as soon as ever your back is turned.'

íííí""And the goddess answered, 'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, you shallnone of you stay here any longer if you do not want to, but there isanother journey which you have got to take before you can sailhomewards. You must go to the house of Hades and of dread Proserpineto consult the ghost of the blind Theban prophet Teiresias whosereason is still unshaken. To him alone has Proserpine left hisunderstanding even in death, but the other ghosts flit aboutaimlessly.'

íííí""I was dismayed when I heard this. I sat up in bed and wept, andwould gladly have lived no longer to see the light of the sun, butpresently when I was tired of weeping and tossing myself about, Isaid, 'And who shall guide me upon this voyage- for the house of Hadesis a port that no ship can reach.'

íííí""'You will want no guide,' she answered; 'raise you mast, set yourwhite sails, sit quite still, and the North Wind will blow you thereof itself. When your ship has traversed the waters of Oceanus, youwill reach the fertile shore of Proserpine's country with its grovesof tall poplars and willows that shed their fruit untimely; here beachyour ship upon the shore of Oceanus, and go straight on to the darkabode of Hades. You will find it near the place where the riversPyriphlegethon and Cocytus (which is a branch of the river Styx)flow into Acheron, and you will see a rock near it, just where the tworoaring rivers run into one another.

íííí""'When you have reached this spot, as I now tell you, dig a trench acubit or so in length, breadth, and depth, and pour into it as adrink-offering to all the dead, first, honey mixed with milk, thenwine, and in the third place water-sprinkling white barley meal overthe whole. Moreover you must offer many prayers to the poor feebleghosts, and promise them that when you get back to Ithaca you willsacrifice a barren heifer to them, the best you have, and will loadthe pyre with good things. More particularly you must promise thatTeiresias shall have a black sheep all to himself, the finest in allyour flocks.

íííí""'When you shall have thus besought the ghosts with your prayers,offer them a ram and a black ewe, bending their heads towardsErebus; but yourself turn away from them as though you would maketowards the river. On this, many dead men's ghosts will come to you,and you must tell your men to skin the two sheep that you have justkilled, and offer them as a burnt sacrifice with prayers to Hadesand to Proserpine. Then draw your sword and sit there, so as toprevent any other poor ghost from coming near the split blood beforeTeiresias shall have answered your questions. The seer willpresently come to you, and will tell you about your voyage- whatstages you are to make, and how you are to sail the see so as to reachyour home.'

íííí""It was day-break by the time she had done speaking, so shedressed me in my shirt and cloak. As for herself she threw a beautifullight gossamer fabric over her shoulders, fastening it with a goldengirdle round her waist, and she covered her head with a mantle. Then Iwent about among the men everywhere all over the house, and spokekindly to each of them man by man: 'You must not lie sleeping here anylonger,' said I to them, 'we must be going, for Circe has told meall about it.' And this they did as I bade them.

íííí""Even so, however, I did not get them away without misadventure.We had with us a certain youth named Elpenor, not very remarkablefor sense or courage, who had got drunk and was lying on the house-topaway from the rest of the men, to sleep off his liquor in the cool.When he heard the noise of the men bustling about, he jumped up on asudden and forgot all about coming down by the main staircase, so hetumbled right off the roof and broke his neck, and his soul wentdown to the house of Hades.

íííí""When I had got the men together I said to them, 'You think youare about to start home again, but Circe has explained to me thatinstead of this, we have got to go to the house of Hades andProserpine to consult the ghost of the Theban prophet Teiresias.'

íííí""The men were broken-hearted as they heard me, and threwthemselves on the ground groaning and tearing their hair, but they didnot mend matters by crying. When we reached the sea shore, weeping andlamenting our fate, Circe brought the ram and the ewe, and we madethem fast hard by the ship. She passed through the midst of us withoutour knowing it, for who can see the comings and goings of a god, ifthe god does not wish to be seen?

ííííTHEN, when we had got down to the sea shore we drew our ship intothe water and got her mast and sails into her; we also put the sheepon board and took our places, weeping and in great distress of mind.Circe, that great and cunning goddess, sent us a fair wind that blewdead aft and stayed steadily with us keeping our sails all the timewell filled; so we did whatever wanted doing to the ship's gear andlet her go as the wind and helmsman headed her. All day long her sailswere full as she held her course over the sea, but when the sun wentdown and darkness was over all the earth, we got into the deepwaters of the river Oceanus, where lie the land and city of theCimmerians who live enshrouded in mist and darkness which the raysof the sun never pierce neither at his rising nor as he goes downagain out of the heavens, but the poor wretches live in one longmelancholy night. When we got there we beached the ship, took thesheep out of her, and went along by the waters of Oceanus till we cameto the place of which Circe had told us.

íííí""Here Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims, while I drew mysword and dug the trench a cubit each way. I made a drink-offeringto all the dead, first with honey and milk, then with wine, andthirdly with water, and I sprinkled white barley meal over thewhole, praying earnestly to the poor feckless ghosts, and promisingthem that when I got back to Ithaca I would sacrifice a barrenheifer for them, the best I had, and would load the pyre with goodthings. I also particularly promised that Teiresias should have ablack sheep to himself, the best in all my flocks. When I had prayedsufficiently to the dead, I cut the throats of the two sheep and letthe blood run into the trench, whereon the ghosts came trooping upfrom Erebus- brides, young bachelors, old men worn out with toil,maids who had been crossed in love, and brave men who had beenkilled in battle, with their armour still smirched with blood; theycame from every quarter and flitted round the trench with a strangekind of screaming sound that made me turn pale with fear. When I sawthem coming I told the men to be quick and flay the carcasses of thetwo dead sheep and make burnt offerings of them, and at the sametime to repeat prayers to Hades and to Proserpine; but I sat where Iwas with my sword drawn and would not let the poor feckless ghostscome near the blood till Teiresias should have answered my questions.

íííí""The first ghost 'that came was that of my comrade Elpenor, for hehad not yet been laid beneath the earth. We had left his bodyunwaked and unburied in Circe's house, for we had had too much else todo. I was very sorry for him, and cried when I saw him: 'Elpenor,'said I, 'how did you come down here into this gloom and darkness?You have here on foot quicker than I have with my ship.'

íííí""'Sir,' he answered with a groan, 'it was all bad luck, and my ownunspeakable drunkenness. I was lying asleep on the top of Circe'shouse, and never thought of coming down again by the great staircasebut fell right off the roof and broke my neck, so my soul down tothe house of Hades. And now I beseech you by all those whom you haveleft behind you, though they are not here, by your wife, by the fatherwho brought you up when you were a child, and by Telemachus who is theone hope of your house, do what I shall now ask you. I know thatwhen you leave this limbo you will again hold your ship for the Aeaeanisland. Do not go thence leaving me unwaked and unburied behind you,or I may bring heaven's anger upon you; but burn me with whateverarmour I have, build a barrow for me on the sea shore, that may tellpeople in days to come what a poor unlucky fellow I was, and plantover my grave the oar I used to row with when I was yet alive and withmy messmates.' And I said, 'My poor fellow, I will do all that youhave asked of me.'

íííí""Thus, then, did we sit and hold sad talk with one another, I on theone side of the trench with my sword held over the blood, and theghost of my comrade saying all this to me from the other side. Thencame the ghost of my dead mother Anticlea, daughter to Autolycus. Ihad left her alive when I set out for Troy and was moved to tears whenI saw her, but even so, for all my sorrow I would not let her comenear the blood till I had asked my questions of Teiresias.

íííí""Then came also the ghost of Theban Teiresias, with his goldensceptre in his hand. He knew me and said, 'Ulysses, noble son ofLaertes, why, poor man, have you left the light of day and come downto visit the dead in this sad place? Stand back from the trench andwithdraw your sword that I may drink of the blood and answer yourquestions truly.'

íííí""So I drew back, and sheathed my sword, whereon when he had drank ofthe blood he began with his prophecy.

íííí""You want to know,' said he, 'about your return home, but heavenwill make this hard for you. I do not think that you will escape theeye of Neptune, who still nurses his bitter grudge against you forhaving blinded his son. Still, after much suffering you may get homeif you can restrain yourself and your companions when your shipreaches the Thrinacian island, where you will find the sheep andcattle belonging to the sun, who sees and gives ear to everything.If you leave these flocks unharmed and think of nothing but of gettinghome, you may yet after much hardship reach Ithaca; but if you harmthem, then I forewarn you of the destruction both of your ship andof your men. Even though you may yourself escape, you will return inbad plight after losing all your men, [in another man's ship, andyou will find trouble in your house, which will be overrun byhigh-handed people, who are devouring your substance under the pretextof paying court and making presents to your wife.

íííí""'When you get home you will take your revenge on these suitors; andafter you have killed them by force or fraud in your own house, youmust take a well-made oar and carry it on and on, till you come to acountry where the people have never heard of the sea and do not evenmix salt with their food, nor do they know anything about ships, andoars that are as the wings of a ship. I will give you this certaintoken which cannot escape your notice. A wayfarer will meet you andwill say it must be a winnowing shovel that you have got upon yourshoulder; on this you must fix the oar in the ground and sacrifice aram, a bull, and a boar to Neptune. Then go home and offer hecatombsto an the gods in heaven one after the other. As for yourself, deathshall come to you from the sea, and your life shall ebb away verygently when you are full of years and peace of mind, and your peopleshall bless you. All that I have said will come true].'

íííí""'This,' I answered, 'must be as it may please heaven, but tell meand tell me and tell me true, I see my poor mother's ghost close byus; she is sitting by the blood without saying a word, and though I amher own son she does not remember me and speak to me; tell me, Sir,how I can make her know me.'

íííí""'That,' said he, 'I can soon do Any ghost that you let taste of theblood will talk with you like a reasonable being, but if you do notlet them have any blood they will go away again.'

íííí""On this the ghost of Teiresias went back to the house of Hades, forhis prophecyings had now been spoken, but I sat still where I wasuntil my mother came up and tasted the blood. Then she knew me at onceand spoke fondly to me, saying, 'My son, how did you come down to thisabode of darkness while you are still alive? It is a hard thing forthe living to see these places, for between us and them there aregreat and terrible waters, and there is Oceanus, which no man cancross on foot, but he must have a good ship to take him. Are you allthis time trying to find your way home from Troy, and have you neveryet got back to Ithaca nor seen your wife in your own house?'

íííí""'Mother,' said I, 'I was forced to come here to consult the ghostof the Theban prophet Teiresias. I have never yet been near theAchaean land nor set foot on my native country, and I have had nothingbut one long series of misfortunes from the very first day that Iset out with Agamemnon for Ilius, the land of noble steeds, to fightthe Trojans. But tell me, and tell me true, in what way did you die?Did you have a long illness, or did heaven vouchsafe you a gentle easypassage to eternity? Tell me also about my father, and the son whomI left behind me; is my property still in their hands, or has some oneelse got hold of it, who thinks that I shall not return to claim it?Tell me again what my wife intends doing, and in what mind she is;does she live with my son and guard my estate securely, or has shemade the best match she could and married again?'

íííí""My mother answered, 'Your wife still remains in your house, but sheis in great distress of mind and spends her whole time in tears bothnight and day. No one as yet has got possession of your fine property,and Telemachus still holds your lands undisturbed. He has to entertainlargely, as of course he must, considering his position as amagistrate, and how every one invites him; your father remains athis old place in the country and never goes near the town. He has nocomfortable bed nor bedding; in the winter he sleeps on the floor infront of the fire with the men and goes about all in rags, but insummer, when the warm weather comes on again, he lies out in thevineyard on a bed of vine leaves thrown anyhow upon the ground. Hegrieves continually about your never having come home, and suffersmore and more as he grows older. As for my own end it was in thiswise: heaven did not take me swiftly and painlessly in my own house,nor was I attacked by any illness such as those that generally wearpeople out and kill them, but my longing to know what you were doingand the force of my affection for you- this it was that was thedeath of me.'

íííí""Then I tried to find some way of embracing my mother's ghost.Thrice I sprang towards her and tried to clasp her in my arms, buteach time she flitted from my embrace as it were a dream or phantom,and being touched to the quick I said to her, 'Mother, why do younot stay still when I would embrace you? If we could throw our armsaround one another we might find sad comfort in the sharing of oursorrows even in the house of Hades; does Proserpine want to lay astill further load of grief upon me by mocking me with a phantomonly?'

íííí""'My son,' she answered, 'most ill-fated of all mankind, it is notProserpine that is beguiling you, but all people are like this whenthey are dead. The sinews no longer hold the flesh and bones together;these perish in the fierceness of consuming fire as soon as life hasleft the body, and the soul flits away as though it were a dream. Now,however, go back to the light of day as soon as you can, and noteall these things that you may tell them to your wife hereafter.'

íííí""Thus did we converse, and anon Proserpine sent up the ghosts of thewives and daughters of all the most famous men. They gathered incrowds about the blood, and I considered how I might question themseverally. In the end I deemed that it would be best to draw thekeen blade that hung by my sturdy thigh, and keep them from alldrinking the blood at once. So they came up one after the other, andeach one as I questioned her told me her race and lineage.

íííí""The first I saw was Tyro. She was daughter of Salmoneus and wife ofCretheus the son of Aeolus. She fell in love with the river Enipeuswho is much the most beautiful river in the whole world. Once when shewas taking a walk by his side as usual, Neptune, disguised as herlover, lay with her at the mouth of the river, and a huge blue wavearched itself like a mountain over them to hide both woman and god,whereon he loosed her virgin girdle and laid her in a deep slumber.When the god had accomplished the deed of love, he took her hand inhis own and said, 'Tyro, rejoice in all good will; the embraces of thegods are not fruitless, and you will have fine twins about this timetwelve months. Take great care of them. I am Neptune, so now gohome, but hold your tongue and do not tell any one.'

íííí""Then he dived under the sea, and she in due course bore Peliasand Neleus, who both of them served Jove with all their might.Pelias was a great breeder of sheep and lived in Iolcus, but the otherlived in Pylos. The rest of her children were by Cretheus, namely,Aeson, Pheres, and Amythaon, who was a mighty warrior and charioteer.

íííí""Next to her I saw Antiope, daughter to Asopus, who could boast ofhaving slept in the arms of even Jove himself, and who bore him twosons Amphion and Zethus. These founded Thebes with its seven gates,and built a wall all round it; for strong though they were theycould not hold Thebes till they had walled it.

íííí""Then I saw Alcmena, the wife of Amphitryon, who also bore to Joveindomitable Hercules; and Megara who was daughter to great King Creon,and married the redoubtable son of Amphitryon.

íííí""I also saw fair Epicaste mother of king OEdipodes whose awful lotit was to marry her own son without suspecting it. He married herafter having killed his father, but the gods proclaimed the wholestory to the world; whereon he remained king of Thebes, in great grieffor the spite the gods had borne him; but Epicaste went to the houseof the mighty jailor Hades, having hanged herself for grief, and theavenging spirits haunted him as for an outraged mother- to his ruingbitterly thereafter.

íííí""Then I saw Chloris, whom Neleus married for her beauty, havinggiven priceless presents for her. She was youngest daughter to Amphionson of Iasus and king of Minyan Orchomenus, and was Queen in Pylos.She bore Nestor, Chromius, and Periclymenus, and she also bore thatmarvellously lovely woman Pero, who was wooed by all the countryround; but Neleus would only give her to him who should raid thecattle of Iphicles from the grazing grounds of Phylace, and this was ahard task. The only man who would undertake to raid them was a certainexcellent seer, but the will of heaven was against him, for therangers of the cattle caught him and put him in prison; neverthelesswhen a full year had passed and the same season came round again,Iphicles set him at liberty, after he had expounded all the oracles ofheaven. Thus, then, was the will of Jove accomplished.

íííí""And I saw Leda the wife of Tyndarus, who bore him two famoussons, Castor breaker of horses, and Pollux the mighty boxer. Boththese heroes are lying under the earth, though they are still alive,for by a special dispensation of Jove, they die and come to lifeagain, each one of them every other day throughout all time, andthey have the rank of gods.

íííí""After her I saw Iphimedeia wife of Aloeus who boasted the embraceof Neptune. She bore two sons Otus and Ephialtes, but both wereshort lived. They were the finest children that were ever born in thisworld, and the best looking, Orion only excepted; for at nine yearsold they were nine fathoms high, and measured nine cubits round thechest. They threatened to make war with the gods in Olympus, and triedto set Mount Ossa on the top of Mount Olympus, and Mount Pelion on thetop of Ossa, that they might scale heaven itself, and they wouldhave done it too if they had been grown up, but Apollo, son of Leto,killed both of them, before they had got so much as a sign of hairupon their cheeks or chin.

íííí""Then I saw Phaedra, and Procris, and fair Ariadne daughter of themagician Minos, whom Theseus was carrying off from Crete to Athens,but he did not enjoy her, for before he could do so Diana killed herin the island of Dia on account of what Bacchus had said against her.

íííí""I also saw Maera and Clymene and hateful Eriphyle, who sold her ownhusband for gold. But it would take me all night if I were to nameevery single one of the wives and daughters of heroes whom I saw,and it is time for me to go to bed, either on board ship with my crew,or here. As for my escort, heaven and yourselves will see to it.""

ííííHere he ended, and the guests sat all of them enthralled andspeechless throughout the covered cloister. Then Arete said to them:

íííí""What do you think of this man, O Phaecians? Is he not tall and goodlooking, and is he not Clever? True, he is my own guest, but all ofyou share in the distinction. Do not he a hurry to send him away,nor niggardly in the presents you make to one who is in such greatneed, for heaven has blessed all of you with great abundance.""

ííííThen spoke the aged hero Echeneus who was one of the oldest menamong them, ""My friends,"" said he, ""what our august queen has justsaid to us is both reasonable and to the purpose, therefore bepersuaded by it; but the decision whether in word or deed restsultimately with King Alcinous.""

íííí""The thing shall be done,"" exclaimed Alcinous, ""as surely as I stilllive and reign over the Phaeacians. Our guest is indeed very anxiousto get home, still we must persuade him to remain with us untilto-morrow, by which time I shall be able to get together the whole sumthat I mean to give him. As regards- his escort it will be a matterfor you all, and mine above all others as the chief person among you.""

ííííAnd Ulysses answered, ""King Alcinous, if you were to bid me tostay here for a whole twelve months, and then speed me on my way,loaded with your noble gifts, I should obey you gladly and it wouldredound greatly to my advantage, for I should return fuller-handedto my own people, and should thus be more respected and beloved by allwho see me when I get back to Ithaca.""

íííí""Ulysses,"" replied Alcinous, ""not one of us who sees you has anyidea that you are a charlatan or a swindler. I know there are manypeople going about who tell such plausible stories that it is veryhard to see through them, but there is a style about your languagewhich assures me of your good disposition. Moreover you have toldthe story of your own misfortunes, and those of the Argives, as thoughyou were a practised bard; but tell me, and tell me true, whetheryou saw any of the mighty heroes who went to Troy at the same timewith yourself, and perished there. The evenings are still at theirlongest, and it is not yet bed time- go on, therefore, with yourdivine story, for I could stay here listening till to-morrowmorning, so long as you will continue to tell us of your adventures.""

íííí""Alcinous,"" answered Ulysses, ""there is a time for makingspeeches, and a time for going to bed; nevertheless, since you sodesire, I will not refrain from telling you the still sadder tale ofthose of my comrades who did not fall fighting with the Trojans, butperished on their return, through the treachery of a wicked woman.

íííí""When Proserpine had dismissed the female ghosts in alldirections, the ghost of Agamemnon son of Atreus came sadly up tome,surrounded by those who had perished with him in the house ofAegisthus. As soon as he had tasted the blood he knew me, andweeping bitterly stretched out his arms towards me to embrace me;but he had no strength nor substance any more, and I too wept andpitied him as I beheld him. 'How did you come by your death,' saidI, 'King Agamemnon? Did Neptune raise his winds and waves againstyou when you were at sea, or did your enemies make an end of you onthe mainland when you were cattle-lifting or sheep-stealing, orwhile they were fighting in defence of their wives and city?'

íííí""'Ulysses,' he answered, 'noble son of Laertes, was not lost atsea in any storm of Neptune's raising, nor did my foes despatch meupon the mainland, but Aegisthus and my wicked wife were the deathof me between them. He asked me to his house, feasted me, and thenbutchered me most miserably as though I were a fat beast in aslaughter house, while all around me my comrades were slain like sheepor pigs for the wedding breakfast, or picnic, or gorgeous banquet ofsome great nobleman. You must have seen numbers of men killed eitherin a general engagement, or in single combat, but you never sawanything so truly pitiable as the way in which we fell in thatcloister, with the mixing-bowl and the loaded tables lying allabout, and the ground reeking with our-blood. I heard Priam's daughterCassandra scream as Clytemnestra killed her close beside me. I laydying upon the earth with the sword in my body, and raised my hands tokill the slut of a murderess, but she slipped away from me; shewould not even close my lips nor my eyes when I was dying, for thereis nothing in this world so cruel and so shameless as a woman when shehas fallen into such guilt as hers was. Fancy murdering her ownhusband! I thought I was going to be welcomed home by my childrenand my servants, but her abominable crime has brought disgrace onherself and all women who shall come after- even on the good ones.'

íííí""And I said, 'In truth Jove has hated the house of Atreus from firstto last in the matter of their women's counsels. See how many of usfell for Helen's sake, and now it seems that Clytemnestra hatchedmischief against too during your absence.'

íííí""'Be sure, therefore,' continued Agamemnon, 'and not be too friendlyeven with your own wife. Do not tell her all that you know perfectlywell yourself. Tell her a part only, and keep your own counsel aboutthe rest. Not that your wife, Ulysses, is likely to murder you, forPenelope is a very admirable woman, and has an excellent nature. Weleft her a young bride with an infant at her breast when we set outfor Troy. This child no doubt is now grown up happily to man's estate,and he and his father will have a joyful meeting and embrace oneanother as it is right they should do, whereas my wicked wife didnot even allow me the happiness of looking upon my son, but killedme ere I could do so. Furthermore I say- and lay my saying to yourheart- do not tell people when you are bringing your ship to Ithaca,but steal a march upon them, for after all this there is no trustingwomen. But now tell me, and tell me true, can you give me any newsof my son Orestes? Is he in Orchomenus, or at Pylos, or is he atSparta with Menelaus- for I presume that he is still living.'

íííí""And I said, 'Agamemnon, why do you ask me? I do not know whetheryour son is alive or dead, and it is not right to talk when one doesnot know.'

íííí""As we two sat weeping and talking thus sadly with one another theghost of Achilles came up to us with Patroclus, Antilochus, and Ajaxwho was the finest and goodliest man of all the Danaans after theson of Peleus. The fleet descendant of Aeacus knew me and spokepiteously, saying, 'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, what deed of daringwill you undertake next, that you venture down to the house of Hadesamong us silly dead, who are but the ghosts of them that can labour nomore?'

íííí""And I said, 'Achilles, son of Peleus, foremost champion of theAchaeans, I came to consult Teiresias, and see if he could advise meabout my return home to Ithaca, for I have never yet been able toget near the Achaean land, nor to set foot in my own country, but havebeen in trouble all the time. As for you, Achilles, no one was everyet so fortunate as you have been, nor ever will be, for you wereadored by all us Argives as long as you were alive, and now that youare here you are a great prince among the dead. Do not, therefore,take it so much to heart even if you are dead.'

íííí""'Say not a word,' he answered, 'in death's favour; I would ratherbe a paid servant in a poor man's house and be above ground thanking of kings among the dead. But give me news about son; is he goneto the wars and will he be a great soldier, or is this not so? Tell mealso if you have heard anything about my father Peleus- does hestill rule among the Myrmidons, or do they show him no respectthroughout Hellas and Phthia now that he is old and his limbs failhim? Could I but stand by his side, in the light of day, with the samestrength that I had when I killed the bravest of our foes upon theplain of Troy- could I but be as I then was and go even for a shorttime to my father's house, any one who tried to do him violence orsupersede him would soon me it.'

íííí""'I have heard nothing,' I answered, 'of Peleus, but I can tellyou all about your son Neoptolemus, for I took him in my own ship fromScyros with the Achaeans. In our councils of war before Troy he wasalways first to speak, and his judgement was unerring. Nestor and Iwere the only two who could surpass him; and when it came tofighting on the plain of Troy, he would never remain with the bodyof his men, but would dash on far in front, foremost of them all invalour. Many a man did he kill in battle- I cannot name every singleone of those whom he slew while fighting on the side of the Argives,but will only say how he killed that valiant hero Eurypylus son ofTelephus, who was the handsomest man I ever saw except Memnon; manyothers also of the Ceteians fell around him by reason of a woman'sbribes. Moreover, when all the bravest of the Argives went insidethe horse that Epeus had made, and it was left to me to settle when weshould either open the door of our ambuscade, or close it, thoughall the other leaders and chief men among the Danaans were dryingtheir eyes and quaking in every limb, I never once saw him turn palenor wipe a tear from his cheek; he was all the time urging me to breakout from the horse- grasping the handle of his sword and hisbronze-shod spear, and breathing fury against the foe. Yet when we hadsacked the city of Priam he got his handsome share of the prizemoney and went on board (such is the fortune of war) without a woundupon him, neither from a thrown spear nor in close combat, for therage of Mars is a matter of great chance.'

íííí""When I had told him this, the ghost of Achilles strode off across ameadow full of asphodel, exulting over what I had said concerningthe prowess of his son.

íííí""The ghosts of other dead men stood near me and told me each his ownmelancholy tale; but that of Ajax son of Telamon alone held aloof-still angry with me for having won the cause in our dispute aboutthe armour of Achilles. Thetis had offered it as a prize, but theTrojan prisoners and Minerva were the judges. Would that I had nevergained the day in such a contest, for it cost the life of Ajax, whowas foremost of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus, alike instature and prowess.

íííí""When I saw him I tried to pacify him and said, 'Ajax, will younot forget and forgive even in death, but must the judgement aboutthat hateful armour still rankle with you? It cost us Argives dearenough to lose such a tower of strength as you were to us. Wemourned you as much as we mourned Achilles son of Peleus himself,nor can the blame be laid on anything but on the spite which Jove boreagainst the Danaans, for it was this that made him counsel yourdestruction- come hither, therefore, bring your proud spirit intosubjection, and hear what I can tell you.'

íííí""He would not answer, but turned away to Erebus and to the otherghosts; nevertheless, I should have made him talk to me in spite ofhis being so angry, or I should have gone talking to him, only thatthere were still others among the dead whom I desired to see.

íííí""Then I saw Minos son of Jove with his golden sceptre in his handsitting in judgement on the dead, and the ghosts were gathered sittingand standing round him in the spacious house of Hades, to learn hissentences upon them.

íííí""After him I saw huge Orion in a meadow full of asphodel driving theghosts of the wild beasts that he had killed upon the mountains, andhe had a great bronze club in his hand, unbreakable for ever and ever.

íííí""And I saw Tityus son of Gaia stretched upon the plain andcovering some nine acres of ground. Two vultures on either side of himwere digging their beaks into his liver, and he kept on trying to beatthem off with his hands, but could not; for he had violated Jove'smistress Leto as she was going through Panopeus on her way to Pytho.

íííí""I saw also the dreadful fate of Tantalus, who stood in a lakethat reached his chin; he was dying to quench his thirst, but couldnever reach the water, for whenever the poor creature stooped todrink, it dried up and vanished, so that there was nothing but dryground- parched by the spite of heaven. There were tall trees,moreover, that shed their fruit over his head- pears, pomegranates,apples, sweet figs and juicy olives, but whenever the poor creaturestretched out his hand to take some, the wind tossed the branches backagain to the clouds.

íííí""And I saw Sisyphus at his endless task raising his prodigious stonewith both his hands. With hands and feet he' tried to roll it up tothe top of the hill, but always, just before he could roll it overon to the other side, its weight would be too much for him, and thepitiless stone would come thundering down again on to the plain.Then he would begin trying to push it up hill again, and the sweat ranoff him and the steam rose after him.

íííí""After him I saw mighty Hercules, but it was his phantom only, forhe is feasting ever with the immortal gods, and has lovely Hebe towife, who is daughter of Jove and Juno. The ghosts were screaminground him like scared birds flying all whithers. He looked black asnight with his bare bow in his hands and his arrow on the string,glaring around as though ever on the point of taking aim. About hisbreast there was a wondrous golden belt adorned in the most marvellousfashion with bears, wild boars, and lions with gleaming eyes; therewas also war, battle, and death. The man who made that belt, do whathe might, would never be able to make another like it. Hercules knewme at once when he saw me, and spoke piteously, saying, my poorUlysses, noble son of Laertes, are you too leading the same sorry kindof life that I did when I was above ground? I was son of Jove, but Iwent through an infinity of suffering, for I became bondsman to onewho was far beneath me- a low fellow who set me all manner of labours.He once sent me here to fetch the hell-hound- for he did not thinkhe could find anything harder for me than this, but I got the houndout of Hades and brought him to him, for Mercury and Minerva helpedme.'

íííí""On this Hercules went down again into the house of Hades, but Istayed where I was in case some other of the mighty dead should cometo me. And I should have seen still other of them that are gonebefore, whom I would fain have seen- Theseus and Pirithous gloriouschildren of the gods, but so many thousands of ghosts came round meand uttered such appalling cries, that I was panic stricken lestProserpine should send up from the house of Hades the head of thatawful monster Gorgon. On this I hastened back to my ship and orderedmy men to go on board at once and loose the hawsers; so theyembarked and took their places, whereon the ship went down thestream of the river Oceanus. We had to row at first, but presently afair wind sprang up.

ííííBOOK XII.

íííí""AFTER we were clear of the river Oceanus, and had got out intothe open sea, we went on till we reached the Aeaean island where thereis dawn and sunrise as in other places. We then drew our ship on tothe sands and got out of her on to the shore, where we went to sleepand waited till day should break.

íííí""Then, when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Isent some men to Circe's house to fetch the body of Elpenor. We cutfirewood from a wood where the headland jutted out into the sea, andafter we had wept over him and lamented him we performed his funeralrites. When his body and armour had been burned to ashes, we raiseda cairn, set a stone over it, and at the top of the cairn we fixed theoar that he had been used to row with.

íííí""While we were doing all this, Circe, who knew that we had gotback from the house of Hades, dressed herself and came to us as fastas she could; and her maid servants came with her bringing us bread,meat, and wine. Then she stood in the midst of us and said, 'Youhave done a bold thing in going down alive to the house of Hades,and you will have died twice, to other people's once; now, then,stay here for the rest of the day, feast your fill, and go on withyour voyage at daybreak tomorrow morning. In the meantime I willtell Ulysses about your course, and will explain everything to himso as to prevent your suffering from misadventure either by land orsea.'

íííí""We agreed to do as she had said, and feasted through the livelongday to the going down of the sun, but when the sun had set and it cameon dark, the men laid themselves down to sleep by the stern cablesof the ship. Then Circe took me by the hand and bade me be seated awayfrom the others, while she reclined by my side and asked me allabout our adventures.

íííí""'So far so good,' said she, when I had ended my story, 'and now payattention to what I am about to tell you- heaven itself, indeed,will recall it to your recollection. First you will come to the Sirenswho enchant all who come near them. If any one unwarily draws in tooclose and hears the singing of the Sirens, his wife and childrenwill never welcome him home again, for they sit in a green field andwarble him to death with the sweetness of their song. There is a greatheap of dead men's bones lying all around, with the flesh stillrotting off them. Therefore pass these Sirens by, and stop yourmen's ears with wax that none of them may hear; but if you like youcan listen yourself, for you may get the men to bind you as youstand upright on a cross-piece half way up the mast, and they mustlash the rope's ends to the mast itself, that you may have thepleasure of listening. If you beg and pray the men to unloose you,then they must bind you faster.

íííí""'When your crew have taken you past these Sirens, I cannot give youcoherent directions as to which of two courses you are to take; I willlay the two alternatives before you, and you must consider them foryourself. On the one hand there are some overhanging rocks againstwhich the deep blue waves of Amphitrite beat with terrific fury; theblessed gods call these rocks the Wanderers. Here not even a birdmay pass, no, not even the timid doves that bring ambrosia to FatherJove, but the sheer rock always carries off one of them, and FatherJove has to send another to make up their number; no ship that everyet came to these rocks has got away again, but the waves andwhirlwinds of fire are freighted with wreckage and with the bodiesof dead men. The only vessel that ever sailed and got through, was thefamous Argo on her way from the house of Aetes, and she too would havegone against these great rocks, only that Juno piloted her past themfor the love she bore to Jason.

íííí""'Of these two rocks the one reaches heaven and its peak is lostin a dark cloud. This never leaves it, so that the top is neverclear not even in summer and early autumn. No man though he had twentyhands and twenty feet could get a foothold on it and climb it, forit runs sheer up, as smooth as though it had been polished. In themiddle of it there is a large cavern, looking West and turnedtowards Erebus; you must take your ship this way, but the cave is sohigh up that not even the stoutest archer could send an arrow into it.Inside it Scylla sits and yelps with a voice that you might take to bethat of a young hound, but in truth she is a dreadful monster and noone- not even a god- could face her without being terror-struck. Shehas twelve mis-shapen feet, and six necks of the most prodigiouslength; and at the end of each neck she has a frightful head withthree rows of teeth in each, all set very close together, so that theywould crunch any one to death in a moment, and she sits deep withinher shady cell thrusting out her heads and peering all round the rock,fishing for dolphins or dogfish or any larger monster that she cancatch, of the thousands with which Amphitrite teems. No ship everyet got past her without losing some men, for she shoots out all herheads at once, and carries off a man in each mouth.

íííí""'You will find the other rocks lie lower, but they are so closetogether that there is not more than a bowshot between them. [Alarge fig tree in full leaf grows upon it], and under it lies thesucking whirlpool of Charybdis. Three times in the day does shevomit forth her waters, and three times she sucks them down again; seethat you be not there when she is sucking, for if you are, Neptunehimself could not save you; you must hug the Scylla side and driveship by as fast as you can, for you had better lose six men thanyour whole crew.'

íííí""'Is there no way,' said I, 'of escaping Charybdis, and at thesame time keeping Scylla off when she is trying to harm my men?'

íííí""'You dare-devil,' replied the goddess, you are always wanting tofight somebody or something; you will not let yourself be beateneven by the immortals. For Scylla is not mortal; moreover she issavage, extreme, rude, cruel and invincible. There is no help forit; your best chance will be to get by her as fast as ever you can,for if you dawdle about her rock while you are putting on your armour,she may catch you with a second cast of her six heads, and snap upanother half dozen of your men; so drive your ship past her at fullspeed, and roar out lustily to Crataiis who is Scylla's dam, badluck to her; she will then stop her from making a second raid uponyou.

íííí""'You will now come to the Thrinacian island, and here you willsee many herds of cattle and flocks of sheep belonging to the sun-god-seven herds of cattle and seven flocks of sheep, with fifty head ineach flock. They do not breed, nor do they become fewer in number, andthey are tended by the goddesses Phaethusa and Lampetie, who arechildren of the sun-god Hyperion by Neaera. Their mother when shehad borne them and had done suckling them sent them to theThrinacian island, which was a long way off, to live there and lookafter their father's flocks and herds. If you leave these flocksunharmed, and think of nothing but getting home, you may yet aftermuch hardship reach Ithaca; but if you harm them, then I forewarnyou of the destruction both of your ship and of your comrades; andeven though you may yourself escape, you will return late, in badplight, after losing all your men.'

íííí""Here she ended, and dawn enthroned in gold began to show in heaven,whereon she returned inland. I then went on board and told my men toloose the ship from her moorings; so they at once got into her, tooktheir places, and began to smite the grey sea with their oars.Presently the great and cunning goddess Circe befriended us with afair wind that blew dead aft, and stayed steadily with us, keeping oursails well filled, so we did whatever wanted doing to the ship's gear,and let her go as wind and helmsman headed her.

íííí""Then, being much troubled in mind, I said to my men, 'My friends,it is not right that one or two of us alone should know the propheciesthat Circe has made me, I will therefore tell you about them, sothat whether we live or die we may do so with our eyes open. First shesaid we were to keep clear of the Sirens, who sit and sing mostbeautifully in a field of flowers; but she said I might hear themmyself so long as no one else did. Therefore, take me and bind me tothe crosspiece half way up the mast; bind me as I stand upright,with a bond so fast that I cannot possibly break away, and lash therope's ends to the mast itself. If I beg and pray you to set mefree, then bind me more tightly still.'

íííí""I had hardly finished telling everything to the men before wereached the island of the two Sirens, for the wind had been veryfavourable. Then all of a sudden it fell dead calm; there was not abreath of wind nor a ripple upon the water, so the men furled thesails and stowed them; then taking to their oars they whitened thewater with the foam they raised in rowing. Meanwhile I look a largewheel of wax and cut it up small with my sword. Then I kneaded the waxin my strong hands till it became soft, which it soon did betweenthe kneading and the rays of the sun-god son of Hyperion. Then Istopped the ears of all my men, and they bound me hands and feet tothe mast as I stood upright on the crosspiece; but they went on rowingthemselves. When we had got within earshot of the land, and the shipwas going at a good rate, the Sirens saw that we were getting in shoreand began with their singing.

íííí""'Come here,' they sang, 'renowned Ulysses, honour to the Achaeanname, and listen to our two voices. No one ever sailed past us withoutstaying to hear the enchanting sweetness of our song- and he wholistens will go on his way not only charmed, but wiser, for we knowall the ills that the gods laid upon the Argives and Trojans beforeTroy, and can tell you everything that is going to happen over thewhole world.'

íííí""They sang these words most musically, and as I longed to hearthem further I made by frowning to my men that they should set mefree; but they quickened their stroke, and Eurylochus and Perimedesbound me with still stronger bonds till we had got out of hearing ofthe Sirens' voices. Then my men took the wax from their ears andunbound me.

íííí""Immediately after we had got past the island I saw a great wavefrom which spray was rising, and I heard a loud roaring sound. The menwere so frightened that they loosed hold of their oars, for thewhole sea resounded with the rushing of the waters, but the shipstayed where it was, for the men had left off rowing. I went round,therefore, and exhorted them man by man not to lose heart.

íííí""'My friends,' said I, 'this is not the first time that we have beenin danger, and we are in nothing like so bad a case as when theCyclops shut us up in his cave; nevertheless, my courage and wisecounsel saved us then, and we shall live to look back on all this aswell. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say, trust in Jove and row onwith might and main. As for you, coxswain, these are your orders;attend to them, for the ship is in your hands; turn her head away fromthese steaming rapids and hug the rock, or she will give you theslip and be over yonder before you know where you are, and you will bethe death of us.'

íííí""So they did as I told them; but I said nothing about the awfulmonster Scylla, for I knew the men would not on rowing if I did, butwould huddle together in the hold. In one thing only did I disobeyCirce's strict instructions- I put on my armour. Then seizing twostrong spears I took my stand on the ship Is bows, for it was therethat I expected first to see the monster of the rock, who was to do mymen so much harm; but I could not make her out anywhere, though Istrained my eyes with looking the gloomy rock all over and over

íííí""Then we entered the Straits in great fear of mind, for on the onehand was Scylla, and on the other dread Charybdis kept sucking upthe salt water. As she vomited it up, it was like the water in acauldron when it is boiling over upon a great fire, and the sprayreached the top of the rocks on either side. When she began to suckagain, we could see the water all inside whirling round and round, andit made a deafening sound as it broke against the rocks. We couldsee the bottom of the whirlpool all black with sand and mud, and themen were at their wit's ends for fear. While we were taken up withthis, and were expecting each moment to be our last, Scylla pounceddown suddenly upon us and snatched up my six best men. I was lookingat once after both ship and men, and in a moment I saw their hands andfeet ever so high above me, struggling in the air as Scylla wascarrying them off, and I heard them call out my name in one lastdespairing cry. As a fisherman, seated, spear in hand, upon somejutting rock throws bait into the water to deceive the poor littlefishes, and spears them with the ox's horn with which his spear isshod, throwing them gasping on to the land as he catches them one byone- even so did Scylla land these panting creatures on her rock andmunch them up at the mouth of her den, while they screamed andstretched out their hands to me in their mortal agony. This was themost sickening sight that I saw throughout all my voyages.

íííí""When we had passed the [Wandering] rocks, with Scylla andterrible Charybdis, we reached the noble island of the sun-god,where were the goodly cattle and sheep belonging to the sunHyperion. While still at sea in my ship I could bear the cattle lowingas they came home to the yards, and the sheep bleating. Then Iremembered what the blind Theban prophet Teiresias had told me, andhow carefully Aeaean Circe had warned me to shun the island of theblessed sun-god. So being much troubled I said to the men, 'My men,I know you are hard pressed, but listen while I tell you theprophecy that Teiresias made me, and how carefully Aeaean Circe warnedme to shun the island of the blessed sun-god, for it was here, shesaid, that our worst danger would lie. Head the ship, therefore,away from the island.'

íííí""The men were in despair at this, and Eurylochus at once gave mean insolent answer. 'Ulysses,' said he, 'you are cruel; you are verystrong yourself and never get worn out; you seem to be made of iron,and now, though your men are exhausted with toil and want of sleep,you will not let them land and cook themselves a good supper upon thisisland, but bid them put out to sea and go faring fruitlessly onthrough the watches of the flying night. It is by night that the windsblow hardest and do so much damage; how can we escape should one ofthose sudden squalls spring up from South West or West, which so oftenwreck a vessel when our lords the gods are unpropitious? Now,therefore, let us obey the of night and prepare our supper here hardby the ship; to-morrow morning we will go on board again and put outto sea.'

íííí""Thus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. I saw thatheaven meant us a mischief and said, 'You force me to yield, for youare many against one, but at any rate each one of you must take hissolemn oath that if he meet with a herd of cattle or a large flockof sheep, he will not be so mad as to kill a single head of either,but will be satisfied with the food that Circe has given us.'

íííí""They all swore as I bade them, and when they had completed theiroath we made the ship fast in a harbour that was near a stream offresh water, and the men went ashore and cooked their suppers. As soonas they had had enough to eat and drink, they began talking abouttheir poor comrades whom Scylla had snatched up and eaten; this setthem weeping and they went on crying till they fell off into a soundsleep.

íííí""In the third watch of the night when the stars had shifted theirplaces, Jove raised a great gale of wind that flew a hurricane so thatland and sea were covered with thick clouds, and night sprang forthout of the heavens. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn,appeared, we brought the ship to land and drew her into a cave whereinthe sea-nymphs hold their courts and dances, and I called the mentogether in council.

íííí""'My friends,' said I, 'we have meat and drink in the ship, let usmind, therefore, and not touch the cattle, or we shall suffer forit; for these cattle and sheep belong to the mighty sun, who seesand gives ear to everything. And again they promised that they wouldobey.

íííí""For a whole month the wind blew steadily from the South, andthere was no other wind, but only South and East. As long as cornand wine held out the men did not touch the cattle when they werehungry; when, however, they had eaten all there was in the ship,they were forced to go further afield, with hook and line, catchingbirds, and taking whatever they could lay their hands on; for theywere starving. One day, therefore, I went up inland that I mightpray heaven to show me some means of getting away. When I had gone farenough to be clear of all my men, and had found a place that waswell sheltered from the wind, I washed my hands and prayed to allthe gods in Olympus till by and by they sent me off into a sweetsleep.

íííí""Meanwhile Eurylochus had been giving evil counsel to the men,'Listen to me,' said he, 'my poor comrades. All deaths are badenough but there is none so bad as famine. Why should not we drivein the best of these cows and offer them in sacrifice to theimmortal Rods? If we ever get back to Ithaca, we can build a finetemple to the sun-god and enrich it with every kind of ornament; if,however, he is determined to sink our ship out of revenge for thesehomed cattle, and the other gods are of the same mind, I for one wouldrather drink salt water once for all and have done with it, than bestarved to death by inches in such a desert island as this is.'

íííí""Thus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. Now thecattle, so fair and goodly, were feeding not far from the ship; themen, therefore drove in the best of them, and they all stood roundthem saying their prayers, and using young oak-shoots instead ofbarley-meal, for there was no barley left. When they had donepraying they killed the cows and dressed their carcasses; they cut outthe thigh bones, wrapped them round in two layers of fat, and set somepieces of raw meat on top of them. They had no wine with which to makedrink-offerings over the sacrifice while it was cooking, so theykept pouring on a little water from time to time while the inwardmeats were being grilled; then, when the thigh bones were burned andthey had tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest up small and putthe pieces upon the spits.

íííí""By this time my deep sleep had left me, and I turned back to theship and to the sea shore. As I drew near I began to smell hot roastmeat, so I groaned out a prayer to the immortal gods. 'Father Jove,' Iexclaimed, 'and all you other gods who live in everlasting bliss,you have done me a cruel mischief by the sleep into which you havesent me; see what fine work these men of mine have been making in myabsence.'

íííí""Meanwhile Lampetie went straight off to the sun and told him we hadbeen killing his cows, whereon he flew into a great rage, and saidto the immortals, 'Father Jove, and all you other gods who live ineverlasting bliss, I must have vengeance on the crew of Ulysses' ship:they have had the insolence to kill my cows, which were the onething I loved to look upon, whether I was going up heaven or downagain. If they do not square accounts with me about my cows, I will godown to Hades and shine there among the dead.'

íííí""'Sun,' said Jove, 'go on shining upon us gods and upon mankind overthe fruitful earth. I will shiver their ship into little pieces with abolt of white lightning as soon as they get out to sea.'

íííí""I was told all this by Calypso, who said she had heard it fromthe mouth of Mercury.

íííí""As soon as I got down to my ship and to the sea shore I rebukedeach one of the men separately, but we could see no way out of it, forthe cows were dead already. And indeed the gods began at once toshow signs and wonders among us, for the hides of the cattle crawledabout, and the joints upon the spits began to low like cows, and themeat, whether cooked or raw, kept on making a noise just as cows do.

íííí""For six days my men kept driving in the best cows and feasting uponthem, but when Jove the son of Saturn had added a seventh day, thefury of the gale abated; we therefore went on board, raised our masts,spread sail, and put out to sea. As soon as we were well away from theisland, and could see nothing but sky and sea, the son of Saturnraised a black cloud over our ship, and the sea grew dark beneathit. We not get on much further, for in another moment we were caughtby a terrific squall from the West that snapped the forestays of themast so that it fell aft, while all the ship's gear tumbled about atthe bottom of the vessel. The mast fell upon the head of thehelmsman in the ship's stern, so that the bones of his head werecrushed to pieces, and he fell overboard as though he were diving,with no more life left in him.

íííí""Then Jove let fly with his thunderbolts, and the ship went roundand round, and was filled with fire and brimstone as the lightningstruck it. The men all fell into the sea; they were carried about inthe water round the ship, looking like so many sea-gulls, but thegod presently deprived them of all chance of getting home again.

íííí""I stuck to the ship till the sea knocked her sides from her keel(which drifted about by itself) and struck the mast out of her inthe direction of the keel; but there was a backstay of stoutox-thong still hanging about it, and with this I lashed the mast andkeel together, and getting astride of them was carried wherever thewinds chose to take me.

íííí""[The gale from the West had now spent its force, and the wind gotinto the South again, which frightened me lest I should be takenback to the terrible whirlpool of Charybdis. This indeed was whatactually happened, for I was borne along by the waves all night, andby sunrise had reacfied the rock of Scylla, and the whirlpool. She wasthen sucking down the salt sea water, but I was carried aloft towardthe fig tree, which I caught hold of and clung on to like a bat. Icould not plant my feet anywhere so as to stand securely, for theroots were a long way off and the boughs that overshadowed the wholepool were too high, too vast, and too far apart for me to reachthem; so I hung patiently on, waiting till the pool should dischargemy mast and raft again- and a very long while it seemed. A jurymanis not more glad to get home to supper, after having been longdetained in court by troublesome cases, than I was to see my raftbeginning to work its way out of the whirlpool again. At last I let gowith my hands and feet, and fell heavily into the sea, bard by my rafton to which I then got, and began to row with my hands. As for Scylla,the father of gods and men would not let her get further sight ofme- otherwise I should have certainly been lost.]

íííí""Hence I was carried along for nine days till on the tenth night thegods stranded me on the Ogygian island, where dwells the great andpowerful goddess Calypso. She took me in and was kind to me, but Ineed say no more about this, for I told you and your noble wife allabout it yesterday, and I hate saying the same thing over and overagain.""

ííííBOOK XIII.

ííííTHUS did he speak, and they all held their peace throughout thecovered cloister, enthralled by the charm of his story, till presentlyAlcinous began to speak.

íííí""Ulysses,"" said he, ""now that you have reached my house I doubtnot you will get home without further misadventure no matter howmuch you have suffered in the past. To you others, however, who comehere night after night to drink my choicest wine and listen to mybard, I would insist as follows. Our guest has already packed up theclothes, wrought gold, and other valuables which you have broughtfor his acceptance; let us now, therefore, present him further, eachone of us, with a large tripod and a cauldron. We will recoupourselves by the levy of a general rate; for private individualscannot be expected to bear the burden of such a handsome present.""

ííííEvery one approved of this, and then they went home to bed each inhis own abode. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn,appeared, they hurried down to the ship and brought their cauldronswith them. Alcinous went on board and saw everything so securelystowed under the ship's benches that nothing could break adrift andinjure the rowers. Then they went to the house of Alcinous to getdinner, and he sacrificed a bull for them in honour of Jove who is thelord of all. They set the steaks to grill and made an excellentdinner, after which the inspired bard, Demodocus, who was afavourite with every one, sang to them; but Ulysses kept on turninghis eyes towards the sun, as though to hasten his setting, for hewas longing to be on his way. As one who has been all day ploughinga fallow field with a couple of oxen keeps thinking about his supperand is glad when night comes that he may go and get it, for it isall his legs can do to carry him, even so did Ulysses rejoice when thesun went down, and he at once said to the Phaecians, addressinghimself more particularly to King Alcinous:

íííí""Sir, and all of you, farewell. Make your drink-offerings and sendme on my way rejoicing, for you have fulfilled my heart's desire bygiving me an escort, and making me presents, which heaven grant that Imay turn to good account; may I find my admirable wife living in peaceamong friends, and may you whom I leave behind me give satisfaction toyour wives and children; may heaven vouchsafe you every good grace,and may no evil thing come among your people.""

ííííThus did he speak. His hearers all of them approved his saying andagreed that he should have his escort inasmuch as he had spokenreasonably. Alcinous therefore said to his servant, ""Pontonous, mixsome wine and hand it round to everybody, that we may offer a prayerto father Jove, and speed our guest upon his way.""

ííííPontonous mixed the wine and handed it to every one in turn; theothers each from his own seat made a drink-offering to the blessedgods that live in heaven, but Ulysses rose and placed the double cupin the hands of queen Arete.

íííí""Farewell, queen,"" said he, ""henceforward and for ever, till age anddeath, the common lot of mankind, lay their hands upon you. I now takemy leave; be happy in this house with your children, your people,and with king Alcinous.""

ííííAs he spoke he crossed the threshold, and Alcinous sent a man toconduct him to his ship and to the sea shore. Arete also sent somemaid servants with him- one with a clean shirt and cloak, another tocarry his strong-box, and a third with corn and wine. When they got tothe water side the crew took these things and put them on board,with all the meat and drink; but for Ulysses they spread a rug and alinen sheet on deck that he might sleep soundly in the stern of theship. Then he too went on board and lay down without a word, but thecrew took every man his place and loosed the hawser from the piercedstone to which it had been bound. Thereon, when they began rowingout to sea, Ulysses fell into a deep, sweet, and almost deathlikeslumber.

ííííThe ship bounded forward on her way as a four in hand chariotflies over the course when the horses feel the whip. Her prow curvetedas it were the neck of a stallion, and a great wave of dark blue waterseethed in her wake. She held steadily on her course, and even afalcon, swiftest of all birds, could not have kept pace with her.Thus, then, she cut her way through the water. carrying one who was ascunning as the gods, but who was now sleeping peacefully, forgetful ofall that he had suffered both on the field of battle and by thewaves of the weary sea.

ííííWhen the bright star that heralds the approach of dawn began toshow. the ship drew near to land. Now there is in Ithaca a haven ofthe old merman Phorcys, which lies between two points that break theline of the sea and shut the harbour in. These shelter it from thestorms of wind and sea that rage outside, so that, when once withinit, a ship may lie without being even moored. At the head of thisharbour there is a large olive tree, and at no distance a fineoverarching cavern sacred to the nymphs who are called Naiads. Thereare mixing-bowls within it and wine-jars of stone, and the bees hivethere. Moreover, there are great looms of stone on which the nymphsweave their robes of sea purple- very curious to see- and at all timesthere is water within it. It has two entrances, one facing North bywhich mortals can go down into the cave, while the other comes fromthe South and is more mysterious; mortals cannot possibly get in byit, it is the way taken by the gods.

ííííInto this harbour, then, they took their ship, for they knew theplace, She had so much way upon her that she ran half her own lengthon to the shore; when, however, they had landed, the first thingthey did was to lift Ulysses with his rug and linen sheet out of theship, and lay him down upon the sand still fast asleep. Then they tookout the presents which Minerva had persuaded the Phaeacians to givehim when he was setting out on his voyage homewards. They put theseall together by the root of the olive tree, away from the road, forfear some passer by might come and steal them before Ulysses awoke;and then they made the best of their way home again.

ííííBut Neptune did not forget the threats with which he had alreadythreatened Ulysses, so he took counsel with Jove. ""Father Jove,""said he, ""I shall no longer be held in any sort of respect among yougods, if mortals like the Phaeacians, who are my own flesh andblood, show such small regard for me. I said I would Ulysses gethome when he had suffered sufficiently. I did not say that he shouldnever get home at all, for I knew you had already nodded your headabout it, and promised that he should do so; but now they have broughthim in a ship fast asleep and have landed him in Ithaca afterloading him with more magnificent presents of bronze, gold, andraiment than he would ever have brought back from Troy, if he hadhad his share of the spoil and got home without misadventure.""

ííííAnd Jove answered, ""What, O Lord of the Earthquake, are youtalking about? The gods are by no means wanting in respect for you. Itwould be monstrous were they to insult one so old and honoured asyou are. As regards mortals, however, if any of them is indulging ininsolence and treating you disrespectfully, it will always rest withyourself to deal with him as you may think proper, so do just as youplease.""

íííí""I should have done so at once,"" replied Neptune, ""if I were notanxious to avoid anything that might displease you; now, therefore,I should like to wreck the Phaecian ship as it is returning from itsescort. This will stop them from escorting people in future; and Ishould also like to bury their city under a huge mountain.""

íííí""My good friend,"" answered Jove, ""I should recommend you at the verymoment when the people from the city are watching the ship on her way,to turn it into a rock near the land and looking like a ship. Thiswill astonish everybody, and you can then bury their city under themountain.""

ííííWhen earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went to Scheria wherethe Phaecians live, and stayed there till the ship, which was makingrapid way, had got close-in. Then he went up to it, turned it intostone, and drove it down with the flat of his hand so as to root it inthe ground. After this he went away.

ííííThe Phaeacians then began talking among themselves, and one wouldturn towards his neighbour, saying, ""Bless my heart, who is it thatcan have rooted the ship in the sea just as she was getting into port?We could see the whole of her only moment ago.""

ííííThis was how they talked, but they knew nothing about it; andAlcinous said, ""I remember now the old prophecy of my father. Hesaid that Neptune would be angry with us for taking every one sosafely over the sea, and would one day wreck a Phaeacian ship as itwas returning from an escort, and bury our city under a high mountain.This was what my old father used to say, and now it is all comingtrue. Now therefore let us all do as I say; in the first place we mustleave off giving people escorts when they come here, and in the nextlet us sacrifice twelve picked bulls to Neptune that he may have mercyupon us, and not bury our city under the high mountain."" When thepeople heard this they were afraid and got ready the bulls.

ííííThus did the chiefs and rulers of the Phaecians to king Neptune,standing round his altar; and at the same time Ulysses woke up oncemore upon his own soil. He had been so long away that he did notknow it again; moreover, Jove's daughter Minerva had made it a foggyday, so that people might not know of his having come, and that shemight tell him everything without either his wife or his fellowcitizens and friends recognizing him until he had taken his revengeupon the wicked suitors. Everything, therefore, seemed quite differentto him- the long straight tracks, the harbours, the precipices, andthe goodly trees, appeared all changed as he started up and lookedupon his native land. So he smote his thighs with the flat of hishands and cried aloud despairingly.

íííí""Alas,"" he exclaimed, ""among what manner of people am I fallen?Are they savage and uncivilized or hospitable and humane? Whereshall I put all this treasure, and which way shall I go? I wish Ihad stayed over there with the Phaeacians; or I could have gone tosome other great chief who would have been good to me and given mean escort. As it is I do not know where to put my treasure, and Icannot leave it here for fear somebody else should get hold of it.In good truth the chiefs and rulers of the Phaeacians have not beendealing fairly by me, and have left me in the wrong country; they saidthey would take me back to Ithaca and they have not done so: mayJove the protector of suppliants chastise them, for he watches overeverybody and punishes those who do wrong. Still, I suppose I mustcount my goods and see if the crew have gone off with any of them.""

ííííHe counted his goodly coppers and cauldrons, his gold and all hisclothes, but there was nothing missing; still he kept grieving aboutnot being in his own country, and wandered up and down by the shore ofthe sounding sea bewailing his hard fate. Then Minerva came up tohim disguised as a young shepherd of delicate and princely mien,with a good cloak folded double about her shoulders; she had sandalson her comely feet and held a javelin in her hand. Ulysses was gladwhen he saw her, and went straight up to her.

íííí""My friend,"" said he, ""you are the first person whom I have met within this country; I salute you, therefore, and beg you to be willdisposed towards me. Protect these my goods, and myself too, for Iembrace your knees and pray to you as though you were a god. Tellme, then, and tell me truly, what land and country is this? Who areits inhabitants? Am I on an island, or is this the sea board of somecontinent?""

ííííMinerva answered, ""Stranger, you must be very simple, or must havecome from somewhere a long way off, not to know what country thisis. It is a very celebrated place, and everybody knows it East andWest. It is rugged and not a good driving country, but it is by nomeans a bid island for what there is of it. It grows any quantity ofcorn and also wine, for it is watered both by rain and dew; itbreeds cattle also and goats; all kinds of timber grow here, and thereare watering places where the water never runs dry; so, sir, thename of Ithaca is known even as far as Troy, which I understand tobe a long way off from this Achaean country.""

ííííUlysses was glad at finding himself, as Minerva told him, in his owncountry, and he began to answer, but he did not speak the truth, andmade up a lying story in the instinctive wiliness of his heart.

íííí""I heard of Ithaca,"" said he, ""when I was in Crete beyond theseas, and now it seems I have reached it with all these treasures. Ihave left as much more behind me for my children, but am flyingbecause I killed Orsilochus son of Idomeneus, the fleetest runner inCrete. I killed him because he wanted to rob me of the spoils I hadgot from Troy with so much trouble and danger both on the field ofbattle and by the waves of the weary sea; he said I had not served hisfather loyally at Troy as vassal, but had set myself up as anindependent ruler, so I lay in wait for him and with one of myfollowers by the road side, and speared him as he was coming into townfrom the country. my It was a very dark night and nobody saw us; itwas not known, therefore, that I had killed him, but as soon as Ihad done so I went to a ship and besought the owners, who werePhoenicians, to take me on board and set me in Pylos or in Eliswhere the Epeans rule, giving them as much spoil as satisfied them.They meant no guile, but the wind drove them off their course, andwe sailed on till we came hither by night. It was all we could do toget inside the harbour, and none of us said a word about supper thoughwe wanted it badly, but we all went on shore and lay down just as wewere. I was very tired and fell asleep directly, so they took my goodsout of the ship, and placed them beside me where I was lying uponthe sand. Then they sailed away to Sidonia, and I was left here ingreat distress of mind.""

ííííSuch was his story, but Minerva smiled and caressed him with herhand. Then she took the form of a woman, fair, stately, and wise,""He must be indeed a shifty lying fellow,"" said she, ""who couldsurpass you in all manner of craft even though you had a god foryour antagonist. Dare-devil that you are, full of guile, unwearying indeceit, can you not drop your tricks and your instinctive falsehood,even now that you are in your own country again? We will say nomore, however, about this, for we can both of us deceive uponoccasion- you are the most accomplished counsellor and orator amongall mankind, while I for diplomacy and subtlety have no equal amongthe gods. Did you not know Jove's daughter Minerva- me, who havebeen ever with you, who kept watch over you in all your troubles,and who made the Phaeacians take so great a liking to you? And now,again, I am come here to talk things over with you, and help you tohide the treasure I made the Phaeacians give you; I want to tell youabout the troubles that await you in your own house; you have got toface them, but tell no one, neither man nor woman, that you havecome home again. Bear everything, and put up with every man'sinsolence, without a word.""

ííííAnd Ulysses answered, ""A man, goddess, may know a great deal, butyou are so constantly changing your appearance that when he meetsyou it is a hard matter for him to know whether it is you or not. Thismuch, however, I know exceedingly well; you were very kind to me aslong as we Achaeans were fighting before Troy, but from the day onwhich we went on board ship after having sacked the city of Priam, andheaven dispersed us- from that day, Minerva, I saw no more of you, andcannot ever remember your coming to my ship to help me in adifficulty; I had to wander on sick and sorry till the godsdelivered me from evil and I reached the city of the Phaeacians, whereyou encouraged me and took me into the town. And now, I beseech you inyour father's name, tell me the truth, for I do not believe I amreally back in Ithaca. I am in some other country and you aremocking me and deceiving me in all you have been saying. Tell methen truly, have I really got back to my own country?""

íííí""You are always taking something of that sort into your head,""replied Minerva, ""and that is why I cannot desert you in yourafflictions; you are so plausible, shrewd and shifty. Any one butyourself on returning from so long a voyage would at once have gonehome to see his wife and children, but you do not seem to care aboutasking after them or hearing any news about them till you haveexploited your wife, who remains at home vainly grieving for you,and having no peace night or day for the tears she sheds on yourbehalf. As for my not coming near you, I was never uneasy about you,for I was certain you would get back safely though you would loseall your men, and I did not wish to quarrel with my uncle Neptune, whonever forgave you for having blinded his son. I will now, however,point out to you the lie of the land, and you will then perhapsbelieve me. This is the haven of the old merman Phorcys, and here isthe olive tree that grows at the head of it; [near it is the cavesacred to the Naiads;] here too is the overarching cavern in which youhave offered many an acceptable hecatomb to the nymphs, and this isthe wooded mountain Neritum.""

ííííAs she spoke the goddess dispersed the mist and the land appeared.Then Ulysses rejoiced at finding himself again in his own land, andkissed the bounteous soil; he lifted up his hands and prayed to thenymphs, saying, ""Naiad nymphs, daughters of Jove, I made sure that Iwas never again to see you, now therefore I greet you with allloving salutations, and I will bring you offerings as in the old days,if Jove's redoubtable daughter will grant me life, and bring my son tomanhood.""

íííí""Take heart, and do not trouble yourself about that,"" rejoinedMinerva, ""let us rather set about stowing your things at once in thecave, where they will be quite safe. Let us see how we can best manageit all.""

ííííTherewith she went down into the cave to look for the safesthiding places, while Ulysses brought up all the treasure of gold,bronze, and good clothing which the Phaecians had given him. Theystowed everything carefully away, and Minerva set a stone againstthe door of the cave. Then the two sat down by the root of the greatolive, and consulted how to compass the destruction of the wickedsuitors.

íííí""Ulysses,"" said Minerva, ""noble son of Laertes, think how you canlay hands on these disreputable people who have been lording it inyour house these three years, courting your wife and making weddingpresents to her, while she does nothing but lament your absence,giving hope and sending your encouraging messages to every one ofthem, but meaning the very opposite of all she says'

ííííAnd Ulysses answered, ""In good truth, goddess, it seems I shouldhave come to much the same bad end in my own house as Agamemnon did,if you had not given me such timely information. Advise me how I shallbest avenge myself. Stand by my side and put your courage into myheart as on the day when we loosed Troy's fair diadem from her brow.Help me now as you did then, and I will fight three hundred men, ifyou, goddess, will be with me.""

íííí""Trust me for that,"" said she, ""I will not lose sight of you whenonce we set about it, and I would imagine that some of those who aredevouring your substance will then bespatter the pavement with theirblood and brains. I will begin by disguising you so that no humanbeing shall know you; I will cover your body with wrinkles; youshall lose all your yellow hair; I will clothe you in a garment thatshall fill all who see it with loathing; I will blear your fine eyesfor you, and make you an unseemly object in the sight of thesuitors, of your wife, and of the son whom you left behind you. Thengo at once to the swineherd who is in charge of your pigs; he has beenalways well affected towards you, and is devoted to Penelope andyour son; you will find him feeding his pigs near the rock that iscalled Raven by the fountain Arethusa, where they are fattening onbeechmast and spring water after their manner. Stay with him andfind out how things are going, while I proceed to Sparta and seeyour son, who is with Menelaus at Lacedaemon, where he has gone to tryand find out whether you are still alive.""

íííí""But why,"" said Ulysses, ""did you not tell him, for you knew allabout it? Did you want him too to go sailing about amid all kinds ofhardship while others are eating up his estate?""

ííííMinerva answered, ""Never mind about him, I sent him that he might bewell spoken of for having gone. He is in no sort of difficulty, but isstaying quite comfortably with Menelaus, and is surrounded withabundance of every kind. The suitors have put out to sea and are lyingin wait for him, for they mean to kill him before he can get home. Ido not much think they will succeed, but rather that some of those whoare now eating up your estate will first find a grave themselves.""

ííííAs she spoke Minerva touched him with her wand and covered himwith wrinkles, took away all his yellow hair, and withered the fleshover his whole body; she bleared his eyes, which were naturally veryfine ones; she changed his clothes and threw an old rag of a wrapabout him, and a tunic, tattered, filthy, and begrimed with smoke; shealso gave him an undressed deer skin as an outer garment, andfurnished him with a staff and a wallet all in holes, with a twistedthong for him to sling it over his shoulder.

ííííWhen the pair had thus laid their plans they parted, and the goddesswent straight to Lacedaemon to fetch Telemachus.

ííííBOOK XIV.

ííííULYSSES now left the haven, and took the rough track up throughthe wooded country and over the crest of the mountain till hereached the place where Minerva had said that he would find theswineherd, who was the most thrifty servant he had. He found himsitting in front of his hut, which was by the yards that he hadbuilt on a site which could be seen from far. He had made themspacious and fair to see, with a free ran for the pigs all round them;he had built them during his master's absence, of stones which hehad gathered out of the ground, without saying anything to Penelope orLaertes, and he had fenced them on top with thorn bushes. Outsidethe yard he had run a strong fence of oaken posts, split, and setpretty close together, while inside lie had built twelve sties nearone another for the sows to lie in. There were fifty pigs wallowing ineach sty, all of them breeding sows; but the boars slept outside andwere much fewer in number, for the suitors kept on eating them, anddie swineherd had to send them the best he had continually. There werethree hundred and sixty boar pigs, and the herdsman's four hounds,which were as fierce as wolves, slept always with them. Theswineherd was at that moment cutting out a pair of sandals from a goodstout ox hide. Three of his men were out herding the pigs in one placeor another, and he had sent the fourth to town with a boar that he hadbeen forced to send the suitors that they might sacrifice it andhave their fill of meat.

ííííWhen the hounds saw Ulysses they set up a furious barking and flewat him, but Ulysses was cunning enough to sit down and loose hishold of the stick that he had in his hand: still, he would have beentorn by them in his own homestead had not the swineherd dropped his oxhide, rushed full speed through the gate of the yard and driven thedogs off by shouting and throwing stones at them. Then he said toUlysses, ""Old man, the dogs were likely to have made short work ofyou, and then you would have got me into trouble. The gods havegiven me quite enough worries without that, for I have lost the bestof masters, and am in continual grief on his account. I have to attendswine for other people to eat, while he, if he yet lives to see thelight of day, is starving in some distant land. But come inside, andwhen you have had your fill of bread and wine, tell me where youcome from, and all about your misfortunes.""

ííííOn this the swineherd led the way into the hut and bade him sitdown. He strewed a good thick bed of rushes upon the floor, and on thetop of this he threw the shaggy chamois skin- a great thick one- onwhich he used to sleep by night. Ulysses was pleased at being madethus welcome, and said ""May Jove, sir, and the rest of the godsgrant you your heart's desire in return for the kind way in whichyou have received me.""

ííííTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, ""Stranger, though a stillpoorer man should come here, it would not be right for me to insulthim, for all strangers and beggars are from Jove. You must take whatyou can get and be thankful, for servants live in fear when theyhave young lords for their masters; and this is my misfortune now, forheaven has hindered the return of him who would have been alwaysgood to me and given me something of my own- a house, a piece of land,a good looking wife, and all else that a liberal master allows aservant who has worked hard for him, and whose labour the gods haveprospered as they have mine in the situation which I hold. If mymaster had grown old here he would have done great things by me, buthe is gone, and I wish that Helen's whole race were utterly destroyed,for she has been the death of many a good man. It was this matter thattook my master to Ilius, the land of noble steeds, to fight theTrojans in the cause of kin Agamemnon.""

ííííAs he spoke he bound his girdle round him and went to the stieswhere the young sucking pigs were penned. He picked out two which hebrought back with him and sacrificed. He singed them, cut them up, andspitted on them; when the meat was cooked he brought it all in and setit before Ulysses, hot and still on the spit, whereon Ulyssessprinkled it over with white barley meal. The swineherd then mixedwine in a bowl of ivy-wood, and taking a seat opposite Ulysses toldhim to begin.

íííí""Fall to, stranger,"" said he, ""on a dish of servant's pork. Thefat pigs have to go to the suitors, who eat them up without shame orscruple; but the blessed gods love not such shameful doings, andrespect those who do what is lawful and right. Even the fiercefree-booters who go raiding on other people's land, and Jove givesthem their spoil- even they, when they have filled their ships and gothome again live conscience-stricken, and look fearfully for judgement;but some god seems to have told these people that Ulysses is deadand gone; they will not, therefore, go back to their own homes andmake their offers of marriage in the usual way, but waste his estateby force, without fear or stint. Not a day or night comes out ofheaven, but they sacrifice not one victim nor two only, and theytake the run of his wine, for he was exceedingly rich. No othergreat man either in Ithaca or on the mainland is as rich as he was; hehad as much as twenty men put together. I will tell you what he had.There are twelve herds of cattle upon the mainland, and as many flocksof sheep, there are also twelve droves of pigs, while his own menand hired strangers feed him twelve widely spreading herds of goats.Here in Ithaca he runs even large flocks of goats on the far end ofthe island, and they are in the charge of excellent goatherds. Eachone of these sends the suitors the best goat in the flock every day.As for myself, I am in charge of the pigs that you see here, and Ihave to keep picking out the best I have and sending it to them.""

ííííThis was his story, but Ulysses went on eating and drinkingravenously without a word, brooding his revenge. When he had eatenenough and was satisfied, the swineherd took the bowl from which heusually drank, filled it with wine, and gave it to Ulysses, who waspleased, and said as he took it in his hands, ""My friend, who was thismaster of yours that bought you and paid for you, so rich and sopowerful as you tell me? You say he perished in the cause of KingAgamemnon; tell me who he was, in case I may have met with such aperson. Jove and the other gods know, but I may be able to give younews of him, for I have travelled much.""

ííííEumaeus answered, ""Old man, no traveller who comes here with newswill get Ulysses' wife and son to believe his story. Nevertheless,tramps in want of a lodging keep coming with their mouths full oflies, and not a word of truth; every one who finds his way to Ithacagoes to my mistress and tells her falsehoods, whereon she takes themin, makes much of them, and asks them all manner of questions,crying all the time as women will when they have lost theirhusbands. And you too, old man, for a shirt and a cloak woulddoubtless make up a very pretty story. But the wolves and birds ofprey have long since torn Ulysses to pieces, or the fishes of thesea have eaten him, and his bones are lying buried deep in sand uponsome foreign shore; he is dead and gone, and a bad business it isfor all his friends- for me especially; go where I may I shall neverfind so good a master, not even if I were to go home to my motherand father where I was bred and born. I do not so much care,however, about my parents now, though I should dearly like to see themagain in my own country; it is the loss of Ulysses that grieves memost; I cannot speak of him without reverence though he is here nolonger, for he was very fond of me, and took such care of me thatwhereever he may be I shall always honour his memory.""

íííí""My friend,"" replied Ulysses, ""you are very positive, and veryhard of belief about your master's coming home again, nevertheless Iwill not merely say, but will swear, that he is coming. Do not give meanything for my news till he has actually come, you may then give me ashirt and cloak of good wear if you will. I am in great want, but Iwill not take anything at all till then, for I hate a man, even as Ihate hell fire, who lets his poverty tempt him into lying. I swearby king Jove, by the rites of hospitality, and by that hearth ofUlysses to which I have now come, that all will surely happen as Ihave said it will. Ulysses will return in this self same year; withthe end of this moon and the beginning of the next he will be hereto do vengeance on all those who are ill treating his wife and son.""

ííííTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, ""Old man, you willneither get paid for bringing good news, nor will Ulysses ever comehome; drink you wine in peace, and let us talk about something else.Do not keep on reminding me of all this; it always pains me when anyone speaks about my honoured master. As for your oath we will let italone, but I only wish he may come, as do Penelope, his old fatherLaertes, and his son Telemachus. I am terribly unhappy too aboutthis same boy of his; he was running up fast into manhood, and badefare to be no worse man, face and figure, than his father, but someone, either god or man, has been unsettling his mind, so he has goneoff to Pylos to try and get news of his father, and the suitors arelying in wait for him as he is coming home, in the hope of leaving thehouse of Arceisius without a name in Ithaca. But let us say no moreabout him, and leave him to be taken, or else to escape if the sonof Saturn holds his hand over him to protect him. And now, old man,tell me your own story; tell me also, for I want to know, who youare and where you come from. Tell me of your town and parents, whatmanner of ship you came in, how crew brought you to Ithaca, and fromwhat country they professed to come- for you cannot have come byland.""

ííííAnd Ulysses answered, ""I will tell you all about it. If there weremeat and wine enough, and we could stay here in the hut with nothingto do but to eat and drink while the others go to their work, Icould easily talk on for a whole twelve months without everfinishing the story of the sorrows with which it has pleased heaven tovisit me.

íííí""I am by birth a Cretan; my father was a well-to-do man, who hadmany sons born in marriage, whereas I was the son of a slave whom hehad purchased for a concubine; nevertheless, my father Castor son ofHylax (whose lineage I claim, and who was held in the highest honouramong the Cretans for his wealth, prosperity, and the valour of hissons) put me on the same level with my brothers who had been born inwedlock. When, however, death took him to the house of Hades, his sonsdivided his estate and cast lots for their shares, but to me they gavea holding and little else; nevertheless, my valour enabled me to marryinto a rich family, for I was not given to bragging, or shirking onthe field of battle. It is all over now; still, if you look at thestraw you can see what the ear was, for I have had trouble enoughand to spare. Mars and Minerva made me doughty in war; when I hadpicked my men to surprise the enemy with an ambuscade I never gavedeath so much as a thought, but was the first to leap forward andspear all whom I could overtake. Such was I in battle, but I did notcare about farm work, nor the frugal home life of those who wouldbring up children. My delight was in ships, fighting, javelins, andarrows- things that most men shudder to think of; but one man likesone thing and another another, and this was what I was mostnaturally inclined to. Before the Achaeans went to Troy, nine timeswas I in command of men and ships on foreign service, and I amassedmuch wealth. I had my pick of the spoil in the first instance, andmuch more was allotted to me later on.

íííí""My house grew apace and I became a great man among the Cretans, butwhen Jove counselled that terrible expedition, in which so manyperished, the people required me and Idomeneus to lead their shipsto Troy, and there was no way out of it, for they insisted on ourdoing so. There we fought for nine whole years, but in the tenth wesacked the city of Priam and sailed home again as heaven dispersed us.Then it was that Jove devised evil against me. I spent but one monthhappily with my children, wife, and property, and then I conceived theidea of making a descent on Egypt, so I fitted out a fine fleet andmanned it. I had nine ships, and the people flocked to fill them.For six days I and my men made feast, and I found them many victimsboth for sacrifice to the gods and for themselves, but on theseventh day we went on board and set sail from Crete with a fair Northwind behind us though we were going down a river. Nothing went illwith any of our ships, and we had no sickness on board, but satwhere we were and let the ships go as the wind and steersmen tookthem. On the fifth day we reached the river Aegyptus; there Istationed my ships in the river, bidding my men stay by them andkeep guard over them while I sent out scouts to reconnoitre from everypoint of vantage.

íííí""But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, andravaged the land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking theirwives and children captive. The alarm was soon carried to the city,and when they heard the war cry, the people came out at daybreaktill the plain was filled with horsemen and foot soldiers and with thegleam of armour. Then Jove spread panic among my men, and they wouldno longer face the enemy, for they found themselves surrounded. TheEgyptians killed many of us, and took the rest alive to do forcedlabour for them. Jove, however, put it in my mind to do thus- and Iwish I had died then and there in Egypt instead, for there was muchsorrow in store for me- I took off my helmet and shield and dropped myspear from my hand; then I went straight up to the king's chariot,clasped his knees and kissed them, whereon he spared my life, bademe get into his chariot, and took me weeping to his own home. Manymade at me with their ashen spears and tried to kil me in theirfury, but the king protected me, for he feared the wrath of Jove theprotector of strangers, who punishes those who do evil.

íííí""I stayed there for seven years and got together much money amongthe Egyptians, for they all gave me something; but when it was nowgoing on for eight years there came a certain Phoenician, a cunningrascal, who had already committed all sorts of villainy, and thisman talked me over into going with him to Phoenicia, where his houseand his possessions lay. I stayed there for a whole twelve months, butat the end of that time when months and days had gone by till the sameseason had come round again, he set me on board a ship bound forLibya, on a pretence that I was to take a cargo along with him to thatplace, but really that he might sell me as a slave and take themoney I fetched. I suspected his intention, but went on board withhim, for I could not help it.

íííí""The ship ran before a fresh North wind till we had reached thesea that lies between Crete and Libya; there, however, Jove counselledtheir destruction, for as soon as we were well out from Crete andcould see nothing but sea and sky, he raised a black cloud over ourship and the sea grew dark beneath it. Then Jove let fly with histhunderbolts and the ship went round and round and was filled withfire and brimstone as the lightning struck it. The men fell all intothe sea; they were carried about in the water round the ship lookinglike so many sea-gulls, but the god presently deprived them of allchance of getting home again. I was all dismayed; Jove, however,sent the ship's mast within my reach, which saved my life, for I clungto it, and drifted before the fury of the gale. Nine days did Idrift but in the darkness of the tenth night a great wave bore me onto the Thesprotian coast. There Pheidon king of the Thesprotiansentertained me hospitably without charging me anything at all forhis son found me when I was nearly dead with cold and fatigue, whereonhe raised me by the hand, took me to his father's house and gave meclothes to wear.

íííí""There it was that I heard news of Ulysses, for the king told mehe had entertained him, and shown him much hospitality while he was onhis homeward journey. He showed me also the treasure of gold, andwrought iron that Ulysses had got together. There was enough to keephis family for ten generations, so much had he left in the house ofking Pheidon. But the king said Ulysses had gone to Dodona that hemight learn Jove's mind from the god's high oak tree, and know whetherafter so long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly, or insecret. Moreover the king swore in my presence, making drink-offeringsin his own house as he did so, that the ship was by the water side,and the crew found, that should take him to his own country. He sentme off however before Ulysses returned, for there happened to be aThesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing island of Dulichium,and he told those in charge of her to be sure and take me safely toKing Acastus.

íííí""These men hatched a plot against me that would have reduced me tothe very extreme of misery, for when the ship had got some way outfrom land they resolved on selling me as a slave. They stripped meof the shirt and cloak that I was wearing, and gave me instead thetattered old clouts in which you now see me; then, towardsnightfall, they reached the tilled lands of Ithaca, and there theybound me with a strong rope fast in the ship, while they went on shoreto get supper by the sea side. But the gods soon undid my bonds forme, and having drawn my rags over my head I slid down the rudderinto the sea, where I struck out and swam till I was well clear ofthem, and came ashore near a thick wood in which I lay concealed. Theywere very angry at my having escaped and went searching about forme, till at last they thought it was no further use and went back totheir ship. The gods, having hidden me thus easily, then took me toa good man's door- for it seems that I am not to die yet awhile.""

ííííTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, ""Poor unhappy stranger, Ihave found the story of your misfortunes extremely interesting, butthat part about Ulysses is not right; and you will never get me tobelieve it. Why should a man like you go about telling lies in thisway? I know all about the return of my master. The gods one and all ofthem detest him, or they would have taken him before Troy, or lethim die with friends around him when the days of his fighting weredone; for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his ashesand his son would have been heir to his renown, but now the stormwinds have spirited him away we know not whither.

íííí""As for me I live out of the way here with the pigs, and never go tothe town unless when Penelope sends for me on the arrival of some newsabout Ulysses. Then they all sit round and ask questions, both thosewho grieve over the king's absence, and those who rejoice at itbecause they can eat up his property without paying for it. For my ownpart I have never cared about asking anyone else since the time when Iwas taken in by an Aetolian, who had killed a man and come a longway till at last he reached my station, and I was very kind to him. Hesaid he had seen Ulysses with Idomeneus among the Cretans, refittinghis ships which had been damaged in a gale. He said Ulysses wouldreturn in the following summer or autumn with his men, and that hewould bring back much wealth. And now you, you unfortunate old man,since fate has brought you to my door, do not try to flatter me inthis way with vain hopes. It is not for any such reason that I shalltreat you kindly, but only out of respect for Jove the god ofhospitality, as fearing him and pitying you.""

ííííUlysses answered, ""I see that you are of an unbelieving mind; I havegiven you my oath, and yet you will not credit me; let us then makea bargain, and call all the gods in heaven to witness it. If yourmaster comes home, give me a cloak and shirt of good wear, and send meto Dulichium where I want to go; but if he does not come as I say hewill, set your men on to me, and tell them to throw me from yonderprecepice, as a warning to tramps not to go about the countrytelling lies.""

íííí""And a pretty figure I should cut then,"" replied Eumaeus, both nowand hereafter, if I were to kill you after receiving you into my hutand showing you hospitality. I should have to say my prayers in goodearnest if I did; but it is just supper time and I hope my men willcome in directly, that we may cook something savoury for supper.""

ííííThus did they converse, and presently the swineherds came up withthe pigs, which were then shut up for the night in their sties, anda tremendous squealing they made as they were being driven intothem. But Eumaeus called to his men and said, ""Bring in the best pigyou have, that I may sacrifice for this stranger, and we will taketoll of him ourselves. We have had trouble enough this long timefeeding pigs, while others reap the fruit of our labour.""

ííííOn this he began chopping firewood, while the others brought in afine fat five year old boar pig, and set it at the altar. Eumaeusdid not forget the gods, for he was a man of good principles, so thefirst thing he did was to cut bristles from the pig's face and throwthem into the fire, praying to all the gods as he did so thatUlysses might return home again. Then he clubbed the pig with a billetof oak which he had kept back when he was chopping the firewood, andstunned it, while the others slaughtered and singed it. Then theycut it up, and Eumaeus began by putting raw pieces from each jointon to some of the fat; these he sprinkled with barley meal, and laidupon the embers; they cut the rest of the meat up small, put thepieces upon the spits and roasted them till they were done; whenthey had taken them off the spits they threw them on to the dresser ina heap. The swineherd, who was a most equitable man, then stood upto give every one his share. He made seven portions; one of these heset apart for Mercury the son of Maia and the nymphs, praying tothem as he did so; the others he dealt out to the men man by man. Hegave Ulysses some slices cut lengthways down the loin as a mark ofespecial honour, and Ulysses was much pleased. ""I hope, Eumaeus,"" saidhe, ""that Jove will be as well disposed towards you as I am, for therespect you are showing to an outcast like myself.""

ííííTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, ""Eat, my good fellow, andenjoy your supper, such as it is. God grants this, and withholds that,just as he thinks right, for he can do whatever he chooses.""

ííííAs he spoke he cut off the first piece and offered it as a burntsacrifice to the immortal gods; then he made them a drink-offering,put the cup in the hands of Ulysses, and sat down to his ownportion. Mesaulius brought them their bread; the swineherd hadbought this man on his own account from among the Taphians duringhis master's absence, and had paid for him with his own moneywithout saying anything either to his mistress or Laertes. They thenlaid their hands upon the good things that were before them, andwhen they had had enough to eat and drink, Mesaulius took away whatwas left of the bread, and they all went to bed after having made ahearty supper.

ííííNow the night came on stormy and very dark, for there was no moon.It poured without ceasing, and the wind blew strong from the West,which is a wet quarter, so Ulysses thought he would see whetherEumaeus, in the excellent care he took of him, would take off hisown cloak and give it him, or make one of his men give him one.""Listen to me,"" said he, ""Eumaeus and the rest of you; when I havesaid a prayer I will tell you something. It is the wine that makesme talk in this way; wine will make even a wise man fall to singing;it will make him chuckle and dance and say many a word that he hadbetter leave unspoken; still, as I have begun, I will go on. Wouldthat I were still young and strong as when we got up an ambuscadebefore Troy. Menelaus and Ulysses were the leaders, but I was incommand also, for the other two would have it so. When we had comeup to the wall of the city we crouched down beneath our armour and laythere under cover of the reeds and thick brush-wood that grew aboutthe swamp. It came on to freeze with a North wind blowing; the snowfell small and fine like hoar frost, and our shields were coated thickwith rime. The others had all got cloaks and shirts, and sleptcomfortably enough with their shields about their shoulders, but I hadcarelessly left my cloak behind me, not thinking that I should betoo cold, and had gone off in nothing but my shirt and shield. Whenthe night was two-thirds through and the stars had shifted their theirplaces, I nudged Ulysses who was close to me with my elbow, and heat once gave me his ear.

íííí""'Ulysses,' said I, 'this cold will be the death of me, for I haveno cloak; some god fooled me into setting off with nothing on but myshirt, and I do not know what to do.'

íííí""Ulysses, who was as crafty as he was valiant, hit upon thefollowing plan:

íííí""'Keep still,' said he in a low voice, 'or the others will hearyou.' Then he raised his head on his elbow.

íííí""'My friends,' said he, 'I have had a dream from heaven in my sleep.We are a long way from the ships; I wish some one would go down andtell Agamemnon to send us up more men at once.'

íííí""On this Thoas son of Andraemon threw off his cloak and set outrunning to the ships, whereon I took the cloak and lay in itcomfortably enough till morning. Would that I were still young andstrong as I was in those days, for then some one of you swineherdswould give me a cloak both out of good will and for the respect due toa brave soldier; but now people look down upon me because my clothesare shabby.""

ííííAnd Eumaeus answered, ""Old man, you have told us an excellent story,and have said nothing so far but what is quite satisfactory; for thepresent, therefore, you shall want neither clothing nor anythingelse that a stranger in distress may reasonably expect, butto-morrow morning you have to shake your own old rags about yourbody again, for we have not many spare cloaks nor shirts up here,but every man has only one. When Ulysses' son comes home again he willgive you both cloak and shirt, and send you wherever you may want togo.""

ííííWith this he got up and made a bed for Ulysses by throwing somegoatskins and sheepskins on the ground in front of the fire. HereUlysses lay down, and Eumaeus covered him over with a great heavycloak that he kept for a change in case of extraordinarily badweather.

ííííThus did Ulysses sleep, and the young men slept beside him. Butthe swineherd did not like sleeping away from his pigs, so he gotready to go and Ulysses was glad to see that he looked after hisproperty during his master's absence. First he slung his sword overhis brawny shoulders and put on a thick cloak to keep out the wind. Healso took the skin of a large and well fed goat, and a javelin in caseof attack from men or dogs. Thus equipped he went to his rest wherethe pigs were camping under an overhanging rock that gave them shelterfrom the North wind.

ííííBOOK XV.

ííííBUT Minerva went to the fair city of Lacedaemon to tell Ulysses' sonthat he was to return at once. She found him and Pisistratussleeping in the forecourt of Menelaus's house; Pisistratus was fastasleep, but Telemachus could get no rest all night for thinking of hisunhappy father, so Minerva went close up to him and said:

íííí""Telemachus, you should not remain so far away from home any longer,nor leave your property with such dangerous people in your house; theywill eat up everything you have among them, and you will have beenon a fool's errand. Ask Menelaus to send you home at once if youwish to find your excellent mother still there when you get back.Her father and brothers are already urging her to marry Eurymachus,who has given her more than any of the others, and has been greatlyincreasing his wedding presents. I hope nothing valuable may have beentaken from the house in spite of you, but you know what women are-they always want to do the best they can for the man who marries them,and never give another thought to the children of their first husband,nor to their father either when he is dead and done with. Go home,therefore, and put everything in charge of the most respectablewoman servant that you have, until it shall please heaven to sendyou a wife of your own. Let me tell you also of another matter whichyou had better attend to. The chief men among the suitors are lying inwait for you in the Strait between Ithaca and Samos, and they meanto kill you before you can reach home. I do not much think they willsucceed; it is more likely that some of those who are now eating upyour property will find a grave themselves. Sail night and day, andkeep your ship well away from the islands; the god who watches overyou and protects you will send you a fair wind. As soon as you getto Ithaca send your ship and men on to the town, but yourself gostraight to the swineherd who has charge your pigs; he is welldisposed towards you, stay with him, therefore, for the night, andthen send him to Penelope to tell her that you have got back safe fromPylos.""

ííííThen she went back to Olympus; but Telemachus stirred Pisistratuswith his heel to rouse him, and said, ""Wake up Pisistratus, and yokethe horses to the chariot, for we must set off home.""

ííííBut Pisistratus said, ""No matter what hurry we are in we cannotdrive in the dark. It will be morning soon; wait till Menelaus hasbrought his presents and put them in the chariot for us; and let himsay good-bye to us in the usual way. So long as he lives a guestshould never forget a host who has shown him kindness.""

ííííAs he spoke day began to break, and Menelaus, who had already risen,leaving Helen in bed, came towards them. When Telemachus saw him heput on his shirt as fast as he could, threw a great cloak over hisshoulders, and went out to meet him. ""Menelaus,"" said he, ""let me goback now to my own country, for I want to get home.""

ííííAnd Menelaus answered, ""Telemachus, if you insist on going I willnot detain you. not like to see a host either too fond of his guest ortoo rude to him. Moderation is best in all things, and not letting aman go when he wants to do so is as bad as telling him to go if hewould like to stay. One should treat a guest well as long as he isin the house and speed him when he wants to leave it. Wait, then, tillI can get your beautiful presents into your chariot, and till you haveyourself seen them. I will tell the women to prepare a sufficientdinner for you of what there may be in the house; it will be at oncemore proper and cheaper for you to get your dinner before settingout on such a long journey. If, moreover, you have a fancy formaking a tour in Hellas or in the Peloponnese, I will yoke myhorses, and will conduct you myself through all our principalcities. No one will send us away empty handed; every one will giveus something- a bronze tripod, a couple of mules, or a gold cup.""

íííí""Menelaus,"" replied Telemachus, ""I want to go home at once, for whenI came away I left my property without protection, and fear that whilelooking for my father I shall come to ruin myself, or find thatsomething valuable has been stolen during my absence.""

ííííWhen Menelaus heard this he immediately told his wife and servantsto prepare a sufficient dinner from what there might be in thehouse. At this moment Eteoneus joined him, for he lived close by andhad just got up; so Menelaus told him to light the fire and cooksome meat, which he at once did. Then Menelaus went down into hisfragrant store room, not alone, but Helen went too, withMegapenthes. When he reached the place where the treasures of hishouse were kept, he selected a double cup, and told his sonMegapenthes to bring also a silver mixing-bowl. Meanwhile Helen wentto the chest where she kept the lovely dresses which she had made withher own hands, and took out one that was largest and mostbeautifully enriched with embroidery; it glittered like a star, andlay at the very bottom of the chest. Then they all came back throughthe house again till they got to Telemachus, and Menelaus said,""Telemachus, may Jove, the mighty husband of Juno, bring you safelyhome according to your desire. I will now present you with thefinest and most precious piece of plate in all my house. It is amixing-bowl of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid with gold,and it is the work of Vulcan. Phaedimus king of the Sidonians mademe a present of it in the course of a visit that I paid him while Iwas on my return home. I should like to give it to you.""

ííííWith these words he placed the double cup in the hands ofTelemachus, while Megapenthes brought the beautiful mixing-bowl andset it before him. Hard by stood lovely Helen with the robe ready inher hand.

íííí""I too, my son,"" said she, ""have something for you as a keepsakefrom the hand of Helen; it is for your bride to wear upon herwedding day. Till then, get your dear mother to keep it for you;thus may you go back rejoicing to your own country and to your home.""

ííííSo saying she gave the robe over to him and he received it gladly.Then Pisistratus put the presents into the chariot, and admired themall as he did so. Presently Menelaus took Telemachus and Pisistratusinto the house, and they both of them sat down to table. A maidservant brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer, and poured itinto a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and she drew a cleantable beside them; an upper servant brought them bread and offeredthem many good things of what there was in the house. Eteoneuscarved the meat and gave them each their portions, while Megapenthespoured out the wine. Then they laid their hands upon the good thingsthat were before them, but as soon as they had had had enough to eatand drink Telemachus and Pisistratus yoked the horses, and tooktheir places in the chariot. They drove out through the innergateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court, andMenelaus came after them with a golden goblet of wine in his righthand that they might make a drink-offering before they set out. Hestood in front of the horses and pledged them, saying, ""Farewell toboth of you; see that you tell Nestor how I have treated you, for hewas as kind to me as any father could be while we Achaeans werefighting before Troy.""

íííí""We will be sure, sir,"" answered Telemachus, ""to tell him everythingas soon as we see him. I wish I were as certain of finding Ulyssesreturned when I get back to Ithaca, that I might tell him of thevery great kindness you have shown me and of the many beautifulpresents I am taking with me.""

ííííAs he was thus speaking a bird flew on his right hand- an eagle witha great white goose in its talons which it had carried off from thefarm yard- and all the men and women were running after it andshouting. It came quite close up to them and flew away on theirright hands in front of the horses. When they saw it they were glad,and their hearts took comfort within them, whereon Pisistratus said,""Tell me, Menelaus, has heaven sent this omen for us or for you?""

ííííMenelaus was thinking what would be the most proper answer for himto make, but Helen was too quick for him and said, ""I will read thismatter as heaven has put it in my heart, and as I doubt not that itwill come to pass. The eagle came from the mountain where it wasbred and has its nest, and in like manner Ulysses, after havingtravelled far and suffered much, will return to take his revenge- ifindeed he is not back already and hatching mischief for the suitors.""

íííí""May Jove so grant it,"" replied Telemachus; ""if it should prove tobe so, I will make vows to you as though you were a god, even when Iam at home.""

ííííAs he spoke he lashed his horses and they started off at fullspeed through the town towards the open country. They swayed theyoke upon their necks and travelled the whole day long till the sunset and darkness was over all the land. Then they reached Pherae,where Diocles lived who was son of Ortilochus, the son of Alpheus.There they passed the night and were treated hospitably. When thechild of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, they again yoked theirhorses and their places in the chariot. They drove out through theinner gateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court. ThenPisistratus lashed his horses on and they flew forward nothingloath; ere long they came to Pylos, and then Telemachus said:

íííí""Pisistratus, I hope you will promise to do what I am going to askyou. You know our fathers were old friends before us; moreover, we areboth of an age, and this journey has brought us together still moreclosely; do not, therefore, take me past my ship, but leave methere, for if I go to your father's house he will try to keep me inthe warmth of his good will towards me, and I must go home at once.""

ííííPisistratus thought how he should do as he was asked, and in the endhe deemed it best to turn his horses towards the ship, and putMenelaus's beautiful presents of gold and raiment in the stern ofthe vessel. Then he said, ""Go on board at once and tell your men to doso also before I can reach home to tell my father. I know howobstinate he is, and am sure he will not let you go; he will come downhere to fetch you, and he will not go back without you. But he will bevery angry.""

ííííWith this he drove his goodly steeds back to the city of the Pyliansand soon reached his home, but Telemachus called the men togetherand gave his orders. ""Now, my men,"" said he, ""get everything inorder on board the ship, and let us set out home.""

ííííThus did he speak, and they went on board even as he had said. Butas Telemachus was thus busied, praying also and sacrificing to Minervain the ship's stern, there came to him a man from a distant country, aseer, who was flying from Argos because he had killed a man. He wasdescended from Melampus, who used to live in Pylos, the land of sheep;he was rich and owned a great house, but he was driven into exile bythe great and powerful king Neleus. Neleus seized his goods and heldthem for a whole year, during which he was a close prisoner in thehouse of king Phylacus, and in much distress of mind both on accountof the daughter of Neleus and because he was haunted by a great sorrowthat dread Erinyes had laid upon him. In the end, however, heescaped with his life, drove the cattle from Phylace to Pylos, avengedthe wrong that had been done him, and gave the daughter of Neleus tohis brother. Then he left the country and went to Argos, where itwas ordained that he should reign over much people. There hemarried, established himself, and had two famous sons Antiphates andMantius. Antiphates became father of Oicleus, and Oicleus ofAmphiaraus, who was dearly loved both by Jove and by Apollo, but hedid not live to old age, for he was killed in Thebes by reason of awoman's gifts. His sons were Alcmaeon and Amphilochus. Mantius, theother son of Melampus, was father to Polypheides and Cleitus.Aurora, throned in gold, carried off Cleitus for his beauty's sake,that he might dwell among the immortals, but Apollo made Polypheidesthe greatest seer in the whole world now that Amphiaraus was dead.He quarrelled with his father and went to live in Hyperesia, wherehe remained and prophesied for all men.

ííííHis son, Theoclymenus, it was who now came up to Telemachus as hewas making drink-offerings and praying in his ship. ""Friend'"" said he,""now that I find you sacrificing in this place, I beseech you byyour sacrifices themselves, and by the god to whom you make them, Ipray you also by your own head and by those of your followers, tell methe truth and nothing but the truth. Who and whence are you? Tell mealso of your town and parents.""

ííííTelemachus said, ""I will answer you quite truly. I am from Ithaca,and my father is 'Ulysses, as surely as that he ever lived. But he hascome to some miserable end. Therefore I have taken this ship and gotmy crew together to see if I can hear any news of him, for he has beenaway a long time.""

íííí""I too,"" answered Theoclymenus, am an exile, for I have killed a manof my own race. He has many brothers and kinsmen in Argos, and theyhave great power among the Argives. I am flying to escape death attheir hands, and am thus doomed to be a wanderer on the face of theearth. I am your suppliant; take me, therefore, on board your shipthat they may not kill me, for I know they are in pursuit.""

íííí""I will not refuse you,"" replied Telemachus, ""if you wish to joinus. Come, therefore, and in Ithaca we will treat you hospitablyaccording to what we have.""

ííííOn this he received Theoclymenus' spear and laid it down on the deckof the ship. He went on board and sat in the stern, biddingTheoclymenus sit beside him; then the men let go the hawsers.Telemachus told them to catch hold of the ropes, and they made allhaste to do so. They set the mast in its socket in the cross plank,raised it and made it fast with the forestays, and they hoistedtheir white sails with sheets of twisted ox hide. Minerva sent thema fair wind that blew fresh and strong to take the ship on hercourse as fast as possible. Thus then they passed by Crouni andChalcis.

ííííPresently the sun set and darkness was over all the land. The vesselmade a quick pass sage to Pheae and thence on to Elis, where theEpeans rule. Telemachus then headed her for the flying islands,wondering within himself whether he should escape death or should betaken prisoner.

ííííMeanwhile Ulysses and the swineherd were eating their supper inthe hut, and the men supped with them. As soon as they had had toeat and drink, Ulysses began trying to prove the swineherd and seewhether he would continue to treat him kindly, and ask him to stayon at the station or pack him off to the city; so he said:

íííí""Eumaeus, and all of you, to-morrow I want to go away and beginbegging about the town, so as to be no more trouble to you or toyour men. Give me your advice therefore, and let me have a goodguide to go with me and show me the way. I will go the round of thecity begging as I needs must, to see if any one will give me a drinkand a piece of bread. I should like also to go to the house of Ulyssesand bring news of her husband to queen Penelope. I could then go aboutamong the suitors and see if out of all their abundance they will giveme a dinner. I should soon make them an excellent servant in all sortsof ways. Listen and believe when I tell you that by the blessing ofMercury who gives grace and good name to the works of all men, thereis no one living who would make a more handy servant than I should- toput fresh wood on the fire, chop fuel, carve, cook, pour out wine, anddo all those services that poor men have to do for their betters.""

ííííThe swineherd was very much disturbed when he heard this. ""Heavenhelp me,"" he exclaimed, ""what ever can have put such a notion asthat into your head? If you go near the suitors you will be undoneto a certainty, for their pride and insolence reach the veryheavens. They would never think of taking a man like you for aservant. Their servants are all young men, well dressed, wearinggood cloaks and shirts, with well looking faces and their hairalways tidy, the tables are kept quite clean and are loaded withbread, meat, and wine. Stay where you are, then; you are not inanybody's way; I do not mind your being here, no more do any of theothers, and when Telemachus comes home he will give you a shirt andcloak and will send you wherever you want to go.""

ííííUlysses answered, ""I hope you may be as dear to the gods as youare to me, for having saved me from going about and getting intotrouble; there is nothing worse than being always ways on the tramp;still, when men have once got low down in the world they will gothrough a great deal on behalf of their miserable bellies. Sincehowever you press me to stay here and await the return ofTelemachus, tell about Ulysses' mother, and his father whom he left onthe threshold of old age when he set out for Troy. Are they stillliving or are they already dead and in the house of Hades?""

íííí""I will tell you all about them,"" replied Eumaeus, ""Laertes is stillliving and prays heaven to let him depart peacefully his own house,for he is terribly distressed about the absence of his son, and alsoabout the death of his wife, which grieved him greatly and aged himmore than anything else did. She came to an unhappy end through sorrowfor her son: may no friend or neighbour who has dealt kindly by mecome to such an end as she did. As long as she was still living,though she was always grieving, I used to like seeing her and askingher how she did, for she brought me up along with her daughterCtimene, the youngest of her children; we were boy and girltogether, and she made little difference between us. When, however, weboth grew up, they sent Ctimene to Same and received a splendiddowry for her. As for me, my mistress gave me a good shirt and cloakwith a pair of sandals for my feet, and sent me off into thecountry, but she was just as fond of me as ever. This is all over now.Still it has pleased heaven to prosper my work in the situationwhich I now hold. I have enough to eat and drink, and can findsomething for any respectable stranger who comes here; but there is nogetting a kind word or deed out of my mistress, for the house hasfallen into the hands of wicked people. Servants want sometimes to seetheir mistress and have a talk with her; they like to have somethingto eat and drink at the house, and something too to take back withthem into the country. This is what will keep servants in a goodhumour.""

ííííUlysses answered, ""Then you must have been a very little fellow,Eumaeus, when you were taken so far away from your home and parents.Tell me, and tell me true, was the city in which your father andmother lived sacked and pillaged, or did some enemies carry you offwhen you were alone tending sheep or cattle, ship you off here, andsell you for whatever your master gave them?""

íííí""Stranger,"" replied Eumaeus, ""as regards your question: sit still,make yourself comfortable, drink your wine, and listen to me. Thenights are now at their longest; there is plenty of time both forsleeping and sitting up talking together; you ought not to go to bedtill bed time, too much sleep is as bad as too little; if any one ofthe others wishes to go to bed let him leave us and do so; he can thentake my master's pigs out when he has done breakfast in the morning.We two will sit here eating and drinking in the hut, and telling oneanother stories about our misfortunes; for when a man has sufferedmuch, and been buffeted about in the world, he takes pleasure inrecalling the memory of sorrows that have long gone by. As regardsyour question, then, my tale is as follows:

íííí""You may have heard of an island called Syra that lies over aboveOrtygia, where the land begins to turn round and look in anotherdirection. It is not very thickly peopled, but the soil is good,with much pasture fit for cattle and sheep, and it abounds with wineand wheat. Dearth never comes there, nor are the people plagued by anysickness, but when they grow old Apollo comes with Diana and killsthem with his painless shafts. It contains two communities, and thewhole country is divided between these two. My father Ctesius son ofOrmenus, a man comparable to the gods, reigned over both.

íííí""Now to this place there came some cunning traders from Phoenicia(for the Phoenicians are great mariners) in a ship which they hadfreighted with gewgaws of all kinds. There happened to be a Phoenicianwoman in my father's house, very tall and comely, and an excellentservant; these scoundrels got hold of her one day when she was washingnear their ship, seduced her, and cajoled her in ways that no womancan resist, no matter how good she may be by nature. The man who hadseduced her asked her who she was and where she came from, and onthis she told him her father's name. 'I come from Sidon,' said she,'and am daughter to Arybas, a man rolling in wealth. One day as Iwas coming into the town from the country some Taphian piratesseized me and took me here over the sea, where they sold me to the manwho owns this house, and he gave them their price for me.'

íííí""The man who had seduced her then said, 'Would you like to comealong with us to see the house of your parents and your parentsthemselves? They are both alive and are said to be well off.'

íííí""'I will do so gladly,' answered she, 'if you men will first swearme a solemn oath that you will do me no harm by the way.'

íííí""They all swore as she told them, and when they had completedtheir oath the woman said, 'Hush; and if any of your men meets me inthe street or at the well, do not let him speak to me, for fear someone should go and tell my master, in which case he would suspectsomething. He would put me in prison, and would have all of youmurdered; keep your own counsel therefore; buy your merchandise asfast as you can, and send me word when you have done loading. I willbring as much gold as I can lay my hands on, and there is somethingelse also that I can do towards paying my fare. I am nurse to theson of the good man of the house, a funny little fellow just able torun about. I will carry him off in your ship, and you will get a greatdeal of money for him if you take him and sell him in foreign parts.'

íííí""On this she went back to the house. The Phoenicians stayed awhole year till they had loaded their ship with much preciousmerchandise, and then, when they had got freight enough, they sentto tell the woman. Their messenger, a very cunning fellow, came tomy father's house bringing a necklace of gold with amber beadsstrung among it; and while my mother and the servants had it intheir hands admiring it and bargaining about it, he made a signquietly to the woman and then went back to the ship, whereon shetook me by the hand and led me out of the house. In the fore part ofthe house she saw the tables set with the cups of guests who hadbeen feasting with my father, as being in attendance on him; thesewere now all gone to a meeting of the public assembly, so she snatchedup three cups and carried them off in the bosom of her dress, whileI followed her, for I knew no better. The sun was now set, anddarkness was over all the land, so we hurried on as fast as we couldtill we reached the harbour, where the Phoenician ship was lying. Whenthey had got on board they sailed their ways over the sea, taking uswith them, and Jove sent then a fair wind; six days did we sail bothnight and day, but on the seventh day Diana struck the woman and shefell heavily down into the ship's hold as though she were a sea gullalighting on the water; so they threw her overboard to the seals andfishes, and I was left all sorrowful and alone. Presently the windsand waves took the ship to Ithaca, where Laertes gave sundry of hischattels for me, and thus it was that ever I came to set eyes uponthis country.""

ííííUlysses answered, ""Eumaeus, I have heard the story of yourmisfortunes with the most lively interest and pity, but Jove has givenyou good as well as evil, for in spite of everything you have a goodmaster, who sees that you always have enough to eat and drink; and youlead a good life, whereas I am still going about begging my way fromcity to city.""

ííííThus did they converse, and they had only a very little time leftfor sleep, for it was soon daybreak. In the meantime Telemachus andhis crew were nearing land, so they loosed the sails, took down themast, and rowed the ship into the harbour. They cast out their mooringstones and made fast the hawsers; they then got out upon the seashore, mixed their wine, and got dinner ready. As soon as they had hadenough to eat and drink Telemachus said, ""Take the ship on to thetown, but leave me here, for I want to look after the herdsmen onone of my farms. In the evening, when I have seen all I want, I willcome down to the city, and to-morrow morning in return for yourtrouble I will give you all a good dinner with meat and wine.""

ííííThen Theoclymenus said, 'And what, my dear young friend, is tobecome of me? To whose house, among all your chief men, am I torepair? or shall I go straight to your own house and to your mother?""

íííí""At any other time,"" replied Telemachus, ""I should have bidden yougo to my own house, for you would find no want of hospitality; atthe present moment, however, you would not be comfortable there, for Ishall be away, and my mother will not see you; she does not often showherself even to the suitors, but sits at her loom weaving in anupper chamber, out of their way; but I can tell you a man whosehouse you can go to- I mean Eurymachus the son of Polybus, who is heldin the highest estimation by every one in Ithaca. He is much thebest man and the most persistent wooer, of all those who are payingcourt to my mother and trying to take Ulysses' place. Jove, however,in heaven alone knows whether or no they will come to a bad end beforethe marriage takes place.""

ííííAs he was speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand- a hawk,Apollo's messenger. It held a dove in its talons, and the feathers, asit tore them off, fell to the ground midway between Telemachus and theship. On this Theoclymenus called him apart and caught him by thehand. ""Telemachus,"" said he, ""that bird did not fly on your right handwithout having been sent there by some god. As soon as I saw it I knewit was an omen; it means that you will remain powerful and thatthere will be no house in Ithaca more royal than your own.""

íííí""I wish it may prove so,"" answered Telemachus. ""If it does, I willshow you so much good will and give you so many presents that allwho meet you will congratulate you.""

ííííThen he said to his friend Piraeus, ""Piraeus, son of Clytius, youhave throughout shown yourself the most willing to serve me of allthose who have accompanied me to Pylos; I wish you would take thisstranger to your own house and entertain him hospitably till I cancome for him.""

ííííAnd Piraeus answered, ""Telemachus, you may stay away as long asyou please, but I will look after him for you, and he shall find nolack of hospitality.""

ííííAs he spoke he went on board, and bade the others do so also andloose the hawsers, so they took their places in the ship. ButTelemachus bound on his sandals, and took a long and doughty spearwith a head of sharpened bronze from the deck of the ship. Then theyloosed the hawsers, thrust the ship off from land, and made on towardsthe city as they had been told to do, while Telemachus strode on asfast as he could, till he reached the homestead where his countlessherds of swine were feeding, and where dwelt the excellentswineherd, who was so devoted a servant to his master.

ííííBOOK XVI.

ííííMEANWHILE Ulysses and the swineherd had lit a fire in the hut andwere were getting breakfast ready at daybreak for they had sent themen out with the pigs. When Telemachus came up, the dogs did not bark,but fawned upon him, so Ulysses, hearing the sound of feet andnoticing that the dogs did not bark, said to Eumaeus:

íííí""Eumaeus, I hear footsteps; I suppose one of your men or some one ofyour acquaintance is coming here, for the dogs are fawning urn him andnot barking.""

ííííThe words were hardly out of his mouth before his son stood at thedoor. Eumaeus sprang to his feet, and the bowls in which he was mixingwine fell from his hands, as he made towards his master. He kissed hishead and both his beautiful eyes, and wept for joy. A father could notbe more delighted at the return of an only son, the child of his oldage, after ten years' absence in a foreign country and after havinggone through much hardship. He embraced him, kissed him all over asthough he had come back from the dead, and spoke fondly to him saying:

íííí""So you are come, Telemachus, light of my eyes that you are. WhenI heard you had gone to Pylos I made sure I was never going to see youany more. Come in, my dear child, and sit down, that I may have a goodlook at you now you are home again; it is not very often you come intothe country to see us herdsmen; you stick pretty close to the towngenerally. I suppose you think it better to keep an eye on what thesuitors are doing.""

íííí""So be it, old friend,"" answered Telemachus, ""but I am come nowbecause I want to see you, and to learn whether my mother is stillat her old home or whether some one else has married her, so thatthe bed of Ulysses is without bedding and covered with cobwebs.""

íííí""She is still at the house,"" replied Eumaeus, ""grieving and breakingher heart, and doing nothing but weep, both night and daycontinually.""

ííííAs spoke he took Telemachus' spear, whereon he crossed the stonethreshold and came inside. Ulysses rose from his seat to give himplace as he entered, but Telemachus checked him; ""Sit down, stranger.""said he, ""I can easily find another seat, and there is one here whowill lay it for me.""

ííííUlysses went back to his own place, and Eumaeus strewed some greenbrushwood on the floor and threw a sheepskin on top of it forTelemachus to sit upon. Then the swineherd brought them platters ofcold meat, the remains from what they had eaten the day before, and hefilled the bread baskets with bread as fast as he could. He mixed winealso in bowls of ivy-wood, and took his seat facing Ulysses. Then theylaid their hands on the good things that were before them, and as soonas they had had enough to eat and drink Telemachus said to Eumaeus,""Old friend, where does this stranger come from? How did his crewbring him to Ithaca, and who were they?-for assuredly he did notcome here by land""'

ííííTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, ""My son, I will tellyou the real truth. He says he is a Cretan, and that he has been agreat traveller. At this moment he is running away from aThesprotian ship, and has refuge at my station, so I will put him intoyour hands. Do whatever you like with him, only remember that he isyour suppliant.""

íííí""I am very much distressed,"" said Telemachus, ""by what you have justtold me. How can I take this stranger into my house? I am as yetyoung, and am not strong enough to hold my own if any man attacksme. My mother cannot make up her mind whether to stay where she is andlook after the house out of respect for public opinion and thememory of her husband, or whether the time is now come for her to takethe best man of those who are wooing her, and the one who will makeher the most advantageous offer; still, as the stranger has come toyour station I will find him a cloak and shirt of good wear, with asword and sandals, and will send him wherever he wants to go. Or ifyou like you can keep him here at the station, and I will send himclothes and food that he may be no burden on you and on your men;but I will not have him go near the suitors, for they are veryinsolent, and are sure to ill-treat him in a way that would greatlygrieve me; no matter how valiant a man may be he can do nothingagainst numbers, for they will be too strong for him.""

ííííThen Ulysses said, ""Sir, it is right that I should say somethingmyself. I am much shocked about what you have said about theinsolent way in which the suitors are behaving in despite of such aman as you are. Tell me, do you submit to such treatment tamely, orhas some god set your people against you? May you not complain of yourbrothers- for it is to these that a man may look for support,however great his quarrel may be? I wish I were as young as you areand in my present mind; if I were son to Ulysses, or, indeed,Ulysses himself, I would rather some one came and cut my head off, butI would go to the house and be the bane of every one of these men.If they were too many for me- I being single-handed- I would ratherdie fighting in my own house than see such disgraceful sights dayafter day, strangers grossly maltreated, and men dragging the womenservants about the house in an unseemly way, wine drawn recklessly,and bread wasted all to no purpose for an end that shall never beaccomplished.""

ííííAnd Telemachus answered, ""I will tell you truly everything. There isno emnity between me and my people, nor can I complain of brothers, towhom a man may look for support however great his quarrel may be. Jovehas made us a race of only sons. Laertes was the only son ofArceisius, and Ulysses only son of Laertes. I am myself the only sonof Ulysses who left me behind him when he went away, so that I havenever been of any use to him. Hence it comes that my house is in thehands of numberless marauders; for the chiefs from all theneighbouring islands, Dulichium, Same, Zacynthus, as also all theprincipal men of Ithaca itself, are eating up my house under thepretext of paying court to my mother, who will neither say point blankthat she will not marry, nor yet bring matters to an end, so theyare making havoc of my estate, and before long will do so withmyself into the bargain. The issue, however, rests with heaven. But doyou, old friend Eumaeus, go at once and tell Penelope that I am safeand have returned from Pylos. Tell it to herself alone, and thencome back here without letting any one else know, for there are manywho are plotting mischief against me.""

íííí""I understand and heed you,"" replied Eumaeus; ""you need instructme no further, only I am going that way say whether I had not betterlet poor Laertes know that you are returned. He used to superintendthe work on his farm in spite of his bitter sorrow about Ulysses,and he would eat and drink at will along with his servants; but theytell me that from the day on which you set out for Pylos he hasneither eaten nor drunk as he ought to do, nor does he look afterhis farm, but sits weeping and wasting the flesh from off his bones.""

íííí""More's the pity,"" answered Telemachus, ""I am sorry for him, butwe must leave him to himself just now. If people could have everythingtheir own way, the first thing I should choose would be the returnof my father; but go, and give your message; then make haste backagain, and do not turn out of your way to tell Laertes. Tell my motherto send one of her women secretly with the news at once, and let himhear it from her.""

ííííThus did he urge the swineherd; Eumaeus, therefore, took hissandals, bound them to his feet, and started for the town. Minervawatched him well off the station, and then came up to it in the formof a woman- fair, stately, and wise. She stood against the side of theentry, and revealed herself to Ulysses, but Telemachus could not seeher, and knew not that she was there, for the gods do not letthemselves be seen by everybody. Ulysses saw her, and so did the dogs,for they did not bark, but went scared and whining off to the otherside of the yards. She nodded her head and motioned to Ulysses withher eyebrows; whereon he left the hut and stood before her outside themain wall of the yards. Then she said to him:

íííí""Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it is now time for you to tellyour son: do not keep him in the dark any longer, but lay your plansfor the destruction of the suitors, and then make for the town. I willnot be long in joining you, for I too am eager for the fray.""

ííííAs she spoke she touched him with her golden wand. First she threw afair clean shirt and cloak about his shoulders; then she made himyounger and of more imposing presence; she gave him back his colour,filled out his cheeks, and let his beard become dark again. Then shewent away and Ulysses came back inside the hut. His son wasastounded when he saw him, and turned his eyes away for fear hemight be looking upon a god.

íííí""Stranger,"" said he, ""how suddenly you have changed from what youwere a moment or two ago. You are dressed differently and yourcolour is not the same. Are you some one or other of the gods thatlive in heaven? If so, be propitious to me till I can make you duesacrifice and offerings of wrought gold. Have mercy upon me.""

ííííAnd Ulysses said, ""I am no god, why should you take me for one? I amyour father, on whose account you grieve and suffer so much at thehands of lawless men.""

ííííAs he spoke he kissed his son, and a tear fell from his cheek onto the ground, for he had restrained all tears till now. butTelemachus could not yet believe that it was his father, and said:

íííí""You are not my father, but some god is flattering me with vainhopes that I may grieve the more hereafter; no mortal man could ofhimself contrive to do as you have been doing, and make yourself oldand young at a moment's notice, unless a god were with him. A secondago you were old and all in rags, and now you are like some god comedown from heaven.""

ííííUlysses answered, ""Telemachus, you ought not to be so immeasurablyastonished at my being really here. There is no other Ulysses who willcome hereafter. Such as I am, it is I, who after long wandering andmuch hardship have got home in the twentieth year to my own country.What you wonder at is the work of the redoubtable goddess Minerva, whodoes with me whatever she will, for she can do what she pleases. Atone moment she makes me like a beggar, and the next I am a young manwith good clothes on my back; it is an easy matter for the gods wholive in heaven to make any man look either rich or poor.""

ííííAs he spoke he sat down, and Telemachus threw his arms about hisfather and wept. They were both so much moved that they cried aloudlike eagles or vultures with crooked talons that have been robbed oftheir half fledged young by peasants. Thus piteously did they weep,and the sun would have gone down upon their mourning if Telemachus hadnot suddenly said, ""In what ship, my dear father, did your crewbring you to Ithaca? Of what nation did they declare themselves to be-for you cannot have come by land?""

íííí""I will tell you the truth, my son,"" replied Ulysses. ""It was thePhaeacians who brought me here. They are great sailors, and are in thehabit of giving escorts to any one who reaches their coasts. They tookme over the sea while I was fast asleep, and landed me in Ithaca,after giving me many presents in bronze, gold, and raiment. Thesethings by heaven's mercy are lying concealed in a cave, and I am nowcome here on the suggestion of Minerva that we may consult aboutkilling our enemies. First, therefore, give me a list of thesuitors, with their number, that I may learn who, and how many, theyare. I can then turn the matter over in my mind, and see whether wetwo can fight the whole body of them ourselves, or whether we mustfind others to help us.""

ííííTo this Telemachus answered, ""Father, I have always heard of yourrenown both in the field and in council, but the task you talk of is avery great one: I am awed at the mere thought of it; two men cannotstand against many and brave ones. There are not ten suitors only, nortwice ten, but ten many times over; you shall learn their number atonce. There are fifty-two chosen youths from Dulichium, and theyhave six servants; from Same there are twenty-four; twenty youngAchaeans from Zacynthus, and twelve from Ithaca itself, all of themwell born. They have with them a servant Medon, a bard, and two menwho can carve at table. If we face such numbers as this, you mayhave bitter cause to rue your coming, and your revenge. See whetheryou cannot think of some one who would be willing to come and helpus.""

íííí""Listen to me,"" replied Ulysses, ""and think whether Minerva andher father Jove may seem sufficient, or whether I am to try and findsome one else as well.""

íííí""Those whom you have named,"" answered Telemachus, ""are a couple ofgood allies, for though they dwell high up among the clouds theyhave power over both gods and men.""

íííí""These two,"" continued Ulysses, ""will not keep long out of the fray,when the suitors and we join fight in my house. Now, therefore, returnhome early to-morrow morning, and go about among the suitors asbefore. Later on the swineherd will bring me to the city disguisedas a miserable old beggar. If you see them ill-treating me, steel yourheart against my sufferings; even though they drag me feet foremostout of the house, or throw things at me, look on and do nothing beyondgently trying to make them behave more reasonably; but they will notlisten to you, for the day of their reckoning is at hand.Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart, when Minerva shallput it in my mind, I will nod my head to you, and on seeing me do thisyou must collect all the armour that is in the house and hide it inthe strong store room. Make some excuse when the suitors ask you whyyou are removing it; say that you have taken it to be out of the wayof the smoke, inasmuch as it is no longer what it was when Ulysseswent away, but has become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add to thismore particularly that you are afraid Jove may set them on toquarrel over their wine, and that they may do each other some harmwhich may disgrace both banquet and wooing, for the sight of armssometimes tempts people to use them. But leave a sword and a spearapiece for yourself and me, and a couple oxhide shields so that we cansnatch them up at any moment; Jove and Minerva will then soon quietthese people. There is also another matter; if you are indeed my sonand my blood runs in your veins, let no one know that Ulysses iswithin the house- neither Laertes, nor yet the swineherd, nor any ofthe servants, nor even Penelope herself. Let you and me exploit thewomen alone, and let us also make trial of some other of the menservants, to see who is on our side and whose hand is against us.""

íííí""Father,"" replied Telemachus, ""you will come to know me by and by,and when you do you will find that I can keep your counsel. I do notthink, however, the plan you propose will turn out well for eitherof us. Think it over. It will take us a long time to go the round ofthe farms and exploit the men, and all the time the suitors will bewasting your estate with impunity and without compunction. Prove thewomen by all means, to see who are disloyal and who guiltless, but Iam not in favour of going round and trying the men. We can attend tothat later on, if you really have some sign from Jove that he willsupport you.""

ííííThus did they converse, and meanwhile the ship which had broughtTelemachus and his crew from Pylos had reached the town of Ithaca.When they had come inside the harbour they drew the ship on to theland; their servants came and took their armour from them, and theyleft all the presents at the house of Clytius. Then they sent aservant to tell Penelope that Telemachus had gone into the country,but had sent the ship to the town to prevent her from being alarmedand made unhappy. This servant and Eumaeus happened to meet whenthey were both on the same errand of going to tell Penelope. When theyreached the House, the servant stood up and said to the queen in thepresence of the waiting women, ""Your son, Madam, is now returnedfrom Pylos""; but Eumaeus went close up to Penelope, and said privatelythat her son had given bidden him tell her. When he had given hismessage he left the house with its outbuildings and went back to hispigs again.

ííííThe suitors were surprised and angry at what had happened, so theywent outside the great wall that ran round the outer court, and held acouncil near the main entrance. Eurymachus, son of Polybus, was thefirst to speak.

íííí""My friends,"" said he, ""this voyage of Telemachus's is a veryserious matter; we had made sure that it would come to nothing. Now,however, let us draw a ship into the water, and get a crew together tosend after the others and tell them to come back as fast as they can.""

ííííHe had hardly done speaking when Amphinomus turned in his placeand saw the ship inside the harbour, with the crew lowering her sails,and putting by their oars; so he laughed, and said to the others,""We need not send them any message, for they are here. Some god musthave told them, or else they saw the ship go by, and could notovertake her.

ííííOn this they rose and went to the water side. The crew then drew theship on shore; their servants took their armour from them, and theywent up in a body to the place of assembly, but they would not let anyone old or young sit along with them, and Antinous, son ofEupeithes, spoke first.

íííí""Good heavens,"" said he, ""see how the gods have saved this manfrom destruction. We kept a succession of scouts upon the headlandsall day long, and when the sun was down we never went on shore tosleep, but waited in the ship all night till morning in the hope ofcapturing and killing him; but some god has conveyed him home in spiteof us. Let us consider how we can make an end of him. He must notescape us; our affair is never likely to come off while is alive,for he is very shrewd, and public feeling is by no means all on ourside. We must make haste before he can call the Achaeans inassembly; he will lose no time in doing so, for he will be furiouswith us, and will tell all the world how we plotted to kill him, butfailed to take him. The people will not like this when they come toknow of it; we must see that they do us no hurt, nor drive us from ourown country into exile. Let us try and lay hold of him either on hisfarm away from the town, or on the road hither. Then we can divideup his property amongst us, and let his mother and the man who marriesher have the house. If this does not please you, and you wishTelemachus to live on and hold his father's property, then we must notgather here and eat up his goods in this way, but must make our offersto Penelope each from his own house, and she can marry the man whowill give the most for her, and whose lot it is to win her.""

ííííThey all held their peace until Amphinomus rose to speak. He was theson of Nisus, who was son to king Aretias, and he was foremost amongall the suitors from the wheat-growing and well grassed island ofDulichium; his conversation, moreover, was more agreeable toPenelope than that of any of the other for he was a man of goodnatural disposition. ""My friends,"" said he, speaking to them plainlyand in all honestly, ""I am not in favour of killing Telemachus. Itis a heinous thing to kill one who is of noble blood. Let us firsttake counsel of the gods, and if the oracles of Jove advise it, I willboth help to kill him myself, and will urge everyone else to do so;but if they dissuade us, I would have you hold your hands.""

ííííThus did he speak, and his words pleased them well, so they roseforthwith and went to the house of Ulysses where they took theiraccustomed seats.

ííííThen Penelope resolved that she would show herself to the suitors.She knew of the plot against Telemachus, for the servant Medon hadoverheard their counsels and had told her; she went down thereforeto the court attended by her maidens, and when she reached the suitorsshe stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of thecloister holding a veil before her face, and rebuked Antinous saying:

íííí""Antinous, insolent and wicked schemer, they say you are the bestspeaker and counsellor of any man your own age in Ithaca, but youare nothing of the kind. Madman, why should you try to compass thedeath of Telemachus, and take no heed of suppliants, whose witnessis Jove himself? It is not right for you to plot thus against oneanother. Do you not remember how your father fled to this house infear of the people, who were enraged against him for having gonewith some Taphian pirates and plundered the Thesprotians who were atpeace with us? They wanted to tear him in pieces and eat up everythinghe had, but Ulysses stayed their hands although they wereinfuriated, and now you devour his property without paying for it, andbreak my heart by his wooing his wife and trying to kill his son.Leave off doing so, and stop the others also.""

ííííTo this Eurymachus son of Polybus answered, ""Take heart, QueenPenelope daughter of Icarius, and do not trouble yourself aboutthese matters. The man is not yet born, nor never will be, who shalllay hands upon your son Telemachus, while I yet live to look uponthe face of the earth. I say- and it shall surely be- that my spearshall be reddened with his blood; for many a time has Ulysses taken meon his knees, held wine up to my lips to drink, and put pieces of meatinto my hands. Therefore Telemachus is much the dearest friend I have,and has nothing to fear from the hands of us suitors. Of course, ifdeath comes to him from the gods, he cannot escape it."" He said thisto quiet her, but in reality he was plotting against Telemachus.

ííííThen Penelope went upstairs again and mourned her husband tillMinerva shed sleep over her eyes. In the evening Eumaeus got back toUlysses and his son, who had just sacrificed a young pig of a year oldand were ready; helping one another to get supper ready; Minervatherefore came up to Ulysses, turned him into an old man with a strokeof her wand, and clad him in his old clothes again, for fear thatthe swineherd might recognize him and not keep the secret, but goand tell Penelope.

ííííTelemachus was the first to speak. ""So you have got back,Eumaeus,"" said he. ""What is the news of the town? Have the suitorsreturned, or are they still waiting over yonder, to take me on myway home?""

íííí""I did not think of asking about that,"" replied Eumaeus, ""when I wasin the town. I thought I would give my message and come back as soonas I could. I met a man sent by those who had gone with you toPylos, and he was the first to tell the new your mother, but I can saywhat I saw with my own eyes; I had just got on to the crest of thehill of Mercury above the town when I saw a ship coming into harbourwith a number of men in her. They had many shields and spears, and Ithought it was the suitors, but I cannot be sure.""

ííííOn hearing this Telemachus smiled to his father, but so that Eumaeuscould not see him.

ííííThen, when they had finished their work and the meal was ready, theyate it, and every man had his full share so that all were satisfied.As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, they laid down torest and enjoyed the boon of sleep.

ííííBOOK XVII.

ííííWHEN the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared,Telemachus bound on his sandals and took a strong spear that suitedhis hands, for he wanted to go into the city. ""Old friend,"" said he tothe swineherd, ""I will now go to the town and show myself to mymother, for she will never leave off grieving till she has seen me. Asfor this unfortunate stranger, take him to the town and let him begthere of any one who will give him a drink and a piece of bread. Ihave trouble enough of my own, and cannot be burdened with otherpeople. If this makes him angry so much the worse for him, but Ilike to say what I mean.""

ííííThen Ulysses said, ""Sir, I do not want to stay here; a beggar canalways do better in town than country, for any one who likes cangive him something. I am too old to care about remaining here at thebeck and call of a master. Therefore let this man do as you havejust told him, and take me to the town as soon as I have had a warm bythe fire, and the day has got a little heat in it. My clothes arewretchedly thin, and this frosty morning I shall be perished withcold, for you say the city is some way off.""

ííííOn this Telemachus strode off through the yards, brooding hisrevenge upon the When he reached home he stood his spear against abearing-post of the cloister, crossed the stone floor of thecloister itself, and went inside.

ííííNurse Euryclea saw him long before any one else did. She was puttingthe fleeces on to the seats, and she burst out crying as she ran up tohim; all the other maids came up too, and covered his head andshoulders with their kisses. Penelope came out of her room lookinglike Diana or Venus, and wept as she flung her arms about her son. Shekissed his forehead and both his beautiful eyes, ""Light of my eyes,""she cried as she spoke fondly to him, ""so you are come home again; Imade sure I was never going to see you any more. To think of yourhaving gone off to Pylos without saying anything about it or obtainingmy consent. But come, tell me what you saw.""

íííí""Do not scold me, mother,' answered Telemachus, ""nor vex me,seeing what a narrow escape I have had, but wash your face, changeyour dress, go upstairs with your maids, and promise full andsufficient hecatombs to all the gods if Jove will only grant us ourrevenge upon the suitors. I must now go to the place of assembly toinvite a stranger who has come back with me from Pylos. I sent himon with my crew, and told Piraeus to take him home and look afterhim till I could come for him myself.""

ííííShe heeded her son's words, washed her face, changed her dress,and vowed full and sufficient hecatombs to all the gods if theywould only vouchsafe her revenge upon the suitors.

ííííTelemachus went through, and out of, the cloisters spear in hand-not alone, for his two fleet dogs went with him. Minerva endowed himwith a presence of such divine comeliness that all marvelled at him ashe went by, and the suitors gathered round him with fair words intheir mouths and malice in their hearts; but he avoided them, and wentto sit with Mentor, Antiphus, and Halitherses, old friends of hisfather's house, and they made him tell them all that had happened tohim. Then Piraeus came up with Theoclymenus, whom he had escortedthrough the town to the place of assembly, whereon Telemachus atonce joined them. Piraeus was first to speak: ""Telemachus,"" said he,""I wish you would send some of your women to my house to take awathe presents Menelaus gave you.""

íííí""We do not know, Piraeus,"" answered Telemachus, ""what may happen. Ifthe suitors kill me in my own house and divide my property among them,I would rather you had the presents than that any of those peopleshould get hold of them. If on the other hand I manage to kill them, Ishall be much obliged if you will kindly bring me my presents.""

ííííWith these words he took Theoclymenus to his own house. When theygot there they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats, went intothe baths, and washed themselves. When the maids had washed andanointed them, and had given them cloaks and shirts, they took theirseats at table. A maid servant then brought them water in abeautiful golden ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for them towash their hands; and she drew a clean table beside them. An upperservant brought them bread and offered them many good things of whatthere was in the house. Opposite them sat Penelope, reclining on acouch by one of the bearing-posts of the cloister, and spinning.Then they laid their hands on the good things that were before them,and as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink Penelope said:

íííí""Telemachus, I shall go upstairs and lie down on that sad couch,which I have not ceased to water with my tears, from the day Ulyssesset out for Troy with the sons of Atreus. You failed, however, to makeit clear to me before the suitors came back to the house, whether orno you had been able to hear anything about the return of yourfather.""

íííí""I will tell you then truth,"" replied her son. ""We went to Pylos andsaw Nestor, who took me to his house and treated me as hospitably asthough I were a son of his own who had just returned after a longabsence; so also did his sons; but he said he had not heard a wordfrom any human being about Ulysses, whether he was alive or dead. Hesent me, therefore, with a chariot and horses to Menelaus. There I sawHelen, for whose sake so many, both Argives and Trojans, were inheaven's wisdom doomed to suffer. Menelaus asked me what it was thathad brought me to Lacedaemon, and I told him the whole truth,whereon he said, 'So, then, these cowards would usurp a brave man'sbed? A hind might as well lay her new-born young in the lair of alion, and then go off to feed in the forest or in some grassy dell.The lion, when he comes back to his lair, will make short work withthe pair of them, and so will Ulysses with these suitors. By fatherJove, Minerva, and Apollo, if Ulysses is still the man that he waswhen he wrestled with Philomeleides in Lesbos, and threw him soheavily that all the Greeks cheered him- if he is still such, and wereto come near these suitors, they would have a short shrift and a sorrywedding. As regards your question, however, I will not prevaricate nordeceive you, but what the old man of the sea told me, so much will Itell you in full. He said he could see Ulysses on an islandsorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph Calypso, who waskeeping him prisoner, and he could not reach his home, for he had noships nor sailors to take him over the sea.' This was what Menelaustold me, and when I had heard his story I came away; the gods thengave me a fair wind and soon brought me safe home again.""

ííííWith these words he moved the heart of Penelope. Then Theoclymenussaid to her:

íííí""Madam, wife of Ulysses, Telemachus does not understand thesethings; listen therefore to me, for I can divine them surely, and willhide nothing from you. May Jove the king of heaven be my witness,and the rites of hospitality, with that hearth of Ulysses to which Inow come, that Ulysses himself is even now in Ithaca, and, eithergoing about the country or staying in one place, is enquiring into allthese evil deeds and preparing a day of reckoning for the suitors. Isaw an omen when I was on the ship which meant this, and I toldTelemachus about it.""

íííí""May it be even so,"" answered Penelope; ""if your words come true,you shall have such gifts and such good will from me that all whosee you shall congratulate you.""

ííííThus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs,or aiming with spears at a mark on the levelled ground in front of thehouse, and behaving with all their old insolence. But when it wasnow time for dinner, and the flock of sheep and goats had come intothe town from all the country round, with their shepherds as usual,then Medon, who was their favourite servant, and who waited uponthem at table, said, ""Now then, my young masters, you have hadenough sport, so come inside that we may get dinner ready. Dinner isnot a bad thing, at dinner time.""

ííííThey left their sports as he told them, and when they were withinthe house, they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats inside, andthen sacrificed some sheep, goats, pigs, and a heifer, all of them fatand well grown. Thus they made ready for their meal. In the meantimeUlysses and the swineherd were about starting for the town, and theswineherd said, ""Stranger, I suppose you still want to go to townto-day, as my master said you were to do; for my own part I shouldhave liked you to stay here as a station hand, but I must do as mymaster tells me, or he will scold me later on, and a scolding fromone's master is a very serious thing. Let us then be off, for it isnow broad day; it will be night again directly and then you willfind it colder.""

íííí""I know, and understand you,"" replied Ulysses; ""you need say nomore. Let us be going, but if you have a stick ready cut, let mehave it to walk with, for you say the road is a very rough one.""

ííííAs he spoke he threw his shabby old tattered wallet over hisshoulders, by the cord from which it hung, and Eumaeus gave him astick to his liking. The two then started, leaving the station incharge of the dogs and herdsmen who remained behind; the swineherd ledthe way and his master followed after, looking like some broken-downold tramp as he leaned upon his staff, and his clothes were all inrags. When they had got over the rough steep ground and were nearingthe city, they reached the fountain from which the citizens drew theirwater. This had been made by Ithacus, Neritus, and Polyctor. There wasa grove of water-loving poplars planted in a circle all round it,and the clear cold water came down to it from a rock high up, whileabove the fountain there was an altar to the nymphs, at which allwayfarers used to sacrifice. Here Melanthius son of Dolius overtookthem as he was driving down some goats, the best in his flock, for thesuitors' dinner, and there were two shepherds with him. When he sawEumaeus and Ulysses he reviled them with outrageous and unseemlylanguage, which made Ulysses very angry.

íííí""There you go,"" cried he, ""and a precious pair you are. See howheaven brings birds of the same feather to one another. Where, pray,master swineherd, are you taking this poor miserable object? Itwould make any one sick to see such a creature at table. A fellow likethis never won a prize for anything in his life, but will go aboutrubbing his shoulders against every man's door post, and begging,not for swords and cauldrons like a man, but only for a few scraps notworth begging for. If you would give him to me for a hand on mystation, he might do to clean out the folds, or bring a bit of sweetfeed to the kids, and he could fatten his thighs as much as he pleasedon whey; but he has taken to bad ways and will not go about any kindof work; he will do nothing but beg victuals all the town over, tofeed his insatiable belly. I say, therefore and it shall surely be- ifhe goes near Ulysses' house he will get his head broken by thestools they will fling at him, till they turn him out.""

ííííOn this, as he passed, he gave Ulysses a kick on the hip out of purewantonness, but Ulysses stood firm, and did not budge from the path.For a moment he doubted whether or no to fly at Melanthius and killhim with his staff, or fling him to the ground and beat his brainsout; he resolved, however, to endure it and keep himself in check, butthe swineherd looked straight at Melanthius and rebuked him, liftingup his hands and praying to heaven as he did so.

íííí""Fountain nymphs,"" he cried, ""children of Jove, if ever Ulyssesburned you thigh bones covered with fat whether of lambs or kids,grant my prayer that heaven may send him home. He would soon put anend to the swaggering threats with which such men as you go aboutinsulting people-gadding all over the town while your flocks are goingto ruin through bad shepherding.""

ííííThen Melanthius the goatherd answered, ""You ill-conditioned cur,what are you talking about? Some day or other I will put you onboard ship and take you to a foreign country, where I can sell you andpocket the money you will fetch. I wish I were as sure that Apollowould strike Telemachus dead this very day, or that the suitorswould kill him, as I am that Ulysses will never come home again.""

ííííWith this he left them to come on at their leisure, while he wentquickly forward and soon reached the house of his master. When hegot there he went in and took his seat among the suitors oppositeEurymachus, who liked him better than any of the others. Theservants brought him a portion of meat, and an upper woman servant setbread before him that he might eat. Presently Ulysses and theswineherd came up to the house and stood by it, amid a sound of music,for Phemius was just beginning to sing to the suitors. Then Ulyssestook hold of the swineherd's hand, and said:

íííí""Eumaeus, this house of Ulysses is a very fine place. No matterhow far you go you will find few like it. One building keeps followingon after another. The outer court has a wall with battlements allround it; the doors are double folding, and of good workmanship; itwould be a hard matter to take it by force of arms. I perceive, too,that there are many people banqueting within it, for there is asmell of roast meat, and I hear a sound of music, which the godshave made to go along with feasting.""

ííííThen Eumaeus said, ""You have perceived aright, as indeed yougenerally do; but let us think what will be our best course. Willyou go inside first and join the suitors, leaving me here behindyou, or will you wait here and let me go in first? But do not waitlong, or some one may you loitering about outside, and throw somethingat you. Consider this matter I pray you.""

ííííAnd Ulysses answered, ""I understand and heed. Go in first andleave me here where I am. I am quite used to being beaten and havingthings thrown at me. I have been so much buffeted about in war andby sea that I am case-hardened, and this too may go with the rest. Buta man cannot hide away the cravings of a hungry belly; this is anenemy which gives much trouble to all men; it is because of thisthat ships are fitted out to sail the seas, and to make war upon otherpeople.""

ííííAs they were thus talking, a dog that had been lying asleep raisedhis head and pricked up his ears. This was Argos, whom Ulysses hadbred before setting out for Troy, but he had never had any work out ofhim. In the old days he used to be taken out by the young men whenthey went hunting wild goats, or deer, or hares, but now that hismaster was gone he was lying neglected on the heaps of mule and cowdung that lay in front of the stable doors till the men should comeand draw it away to manure the great close; and he was full offleas. As soon as he saw Ulysses standing there, he dropped his earsand wagged his tail, but he could not get close up to his master. WhenUlysses saw the dog on the other side of the yard, dashed a tearfrom his eyes without Eumaeus seeing it, and said:

íííí""Eumaeus, what a noble hound that is over yonder on the manure heap:his build is splendid; is he as fine a fellow as he looks, or is heonly one of those dogs that come begging about a table, and are keptmerely for show?""

íííí""This hound,"" answered Eumaeus, ""belonged to him who has died in afar country. If he were what he was when Ulysses left for Troy, hewould soon show you what he could do. There was not a wild beast inthe forest that could get away from him when he was once on itstracks. But now he has fallen on evil times, for his master is deadand gone, and the women take no care of him. Servants never do theirwork when their master's hand is no longer over them, for Jove takeshalf the goodness out of a man when he makes a slave of him.""

ííííAs he spoke he went inside the buildings to the cloister where thesuitors were, but Argos died as soon as he had recognized his master.

ííííTelemachus saw Eumaeus long before any one else did, and beckonedhim to come and sit beside him; so he looked about and saw a seatlying near where the carver sat serving out their portions to thesuitors; he picked it up, brought it to Telemachus's table, and satdown opposite him. Then the servant brought him his portion, andgave him bread from the bread-basket.

ííííImmediately afterwards Ulysses came inside, looking like a poormiserable old beggar, leaning on his staff and with his clothes all inrags. He sat down upon the threshold of ash-wood just inside the doorsleading from the outer to the inner court, and against abearing-post of cypress-wood which the carpenter had skillfullyplaned, and had made to join truly with rule and line. Telemachus tooka whole loaf from the bread-basket, with as much meat as he could holdin his two hands, and said to Eumaeus, ""Take this to the stranger, andtell him to go the round of the suitors, and beg from them; a beggarmust not be shamefaced.""

ííííSo Eumaeus went up to him and said, ""Stranger, Telemachus sendsyou this, and says you are to go the round of the suitors begging, forbeggars must not be shamefaced.""

ííííUlysses answered, ""May King Jove grant all happiness toTelemachus, and fulfil the desire of his heart.""

ííííThen with both hands he took what Telemachus had sent him, andlaid it on the dirty old wallet at his feet. He went on eating itwhile the bard was singing, and had just finished his dinner as heleft off. The suitors applauded the bard, whereon Minerva went up toUlysses and prompted him to beg pieces of bread from each one of thesuitors, that he might see what kind of people they were, and tell thegood from the bad; but come what might she was not going to save asingle one of them. Ulysses, therefore, went on his round, goingfrom left to right, and stretched out his hands to beg as though hewere a real beggar. Some of them pitied him, and were curious abouthim, asking one another who he was and where he came from; whereon thegoatherd Melanthius said, ""Suitors of my noble mistress, I can tellyou something about him, for I have seen him before. The swineherdbrought him here, but I know nothing about the man himself, norwhere he comes from.""

ííííOn this Antinous began to abuse the swineherd. ""You precious idiot,""he cried, ""what have you brought this man to town for? Have we nottramps and beggars enough already to pester us as we sit at meat? Doyou think it a small thing that such people gather here to wasteyour master's property and must you needs bring this man as well?""

ííííAnd Eumaeus answered, ""Antinous, your birth is good but your wordsevil. It was no doing of mine that he came here. Who is likely toinvite a stranger from a foreign country, unless it be one of thosewho can do public service as a seer, a healer of hurts, a carpenter,or a bard who can charm us with his Such men are welcome all the worldover, but no one is likely to ask a beggar who will only worry him.You are always harder on Ulysses' servants than any of the othersuitors are, and above all on me, but I do not care so long asTelemachus and Penelope are alive and here.""

ííííBut Telemachus said, ""Hush, do not answer him; Antinous has thebitterest tongue of all the suitors, and he makes the others worse.""

ííííThen turning to Antinous he said, ""Antinous, you take as much careof my interests as though I were your son. Why should you want tosee this stranger turned out of the house? Heaven forbid; take'something and give it him yourself; I do not grudge it; I bid you takeit. Never mind my mother, nor any of the other servants in thehouse; but I know you will not do what I say, for you are more fond ofeating things yourself than of giving them to other people.""

íííí""What do you mean, Telemachus,"" replied Antinous, ""by thisswaggering talk? If all the suitors were to give him as much as Iwill, he would not come here again for another three months.""

ííííAs he spoke he drew the stool on which he rested his dainty feetfrom under the table, and made as though he would throw it at Ulysses,but the other suitors all gave him something, and filled his walletwith bread and meat; he was about, therefore, to go back to thethreshold and eat what the suitors had given him, but he first went upto Antinous and said:

íííí""Sir, give me something; you are not, surely, the poorest manhere; you seem to be a chief, foremost among them all; therefore youshould be the better giver, and I will tell far and wide of yourbounty. I too was a rich man once, and had a fine house of my own;in those days I gave to many a tramp such as I now am, no matter whohe might be nor what he wanted. I had any number of servants, andall the other things which people have who live well and are accountedwealthy, but it pleased Jove to take all away from me. He sent me witha band of roving robbers to Egypt; it was a long voyage and I wasundone by it. I stationed my bade ships in the river Aegyptus, andbade my men stay by them and keep guard over them, while sent outscouts to reconnoitre from every point of vantage.

íííí""But the men disobeyed my orders, took to their own devices, andravaged the land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking theirwives and children captives. The alarm was soon carried to the city,and when they heard the war-cry, the people came out at daybreaktill the plain was filled with soldiers horse and foot, and with thegleam of armour. Then Jove spread panic among my men, and they wouldno longer face the enemy, for they found themselves surrounded. TheEgyptians killed many of us, and took the rest alive to do forcedlabour for them; as for myself, they gave me to a friend who met them,to take to Cyprus, Dmetor by name, son of Iasus, who was a great manin Cyprus. Thence I am come hither in a state of great misery.""

ííííThen Antinous said, ""What god can have sent such a pestilence toplague us during our dinner? Get out, into the open part of the court,or I will give you Egypt and Cyprus over again for your insolenceand importunity; you have begged of all the others, and they havegiven you lavishly, for they have abundance round them, and it is easyto be free with other people's property when there is plenty of it.""

ííííOn this Ulysses began to move off, and said, ""Your looks, my finesir, are better than your breeding; if you were in your own houseyou would not spare a poor man so much as a pinch of salt, forthough you are in another man's, and surrounded with abundance, youcannot find it in you to give him even a piece of bread.""

ííííThis made Antinous very angry, and he scowled at him saying, ""Youshall pay for this before you get clear of the court."" With thesewords he threw a footstool at him, and hit him on the rightshoulder-blade near the top of his back. Ulysses stood firm as arock and the blow did not even stagger him, but he shook his head insilence as he brooded on his revenge. Then he went back to thethreshold and sat down there, laying his well-filled wallet at hisfeet.

íííí""Listen to me,"" he cried, ""you suitors of Queen Penelope, that I mayspeak even as I am minded. A man knows neither ache nor pain if hegets hit while fighting for his money, or for his sheep or his cattle;and even so Antinous has hit me while in the service of my miserablebelly, which is always getting people into trouble. Still, if the poorhave gods and avenging deities at all, I pray them that Antinous maycome to a bad end before his marriage.""

íííí""Sit where you are, and eat your victuals in silence, or be offelsewhere,"" shouted Antinous. ""If you say more I will have you draggedhand and foot through the courts, and the servants shall flay youalive.""

ííííThe other suitors were much displeased at this, and one of the youngmen said, ""Antinous, you did ill in striking that poor wretch of atramp: it will be worse for you if he should turn out to be somegod- and we know the gods go about disguised in all sorts of ways aspeople from foreign countries, and travel about the world to see whodo amiss and who righteously.""

ííííThus said the suitors, but Antinous paid them no heed. MeanwhileTelemachus was furious about the blow that had been given to hisfather, and though no tear fell from him, he shook his head in silenceand brooded on his revenge.

ííííNow when Penelope heard that the beggar had been struck in thebanqueting-cloister, she said before her maids, ""Would that Apollowould so strike you, Antinous,"" and her waiting woman Eurynomeanswered, ""If our prayers were answered not one of the suitors wouldever again see the sun rise."" Then Penelope said, ""Nurse, I hate everysingle one of them, for they mean nothing but mischief, but I hateAntinous like the darkness of death itself. A poor unfortunate tramphas come begging about the house for sheer want. Every one else hasgiven him something to put in his wallet, but Antinous has hit himon the right shoulder-blade with a footstool.""

ííííThus did she talk with her maids as she sat in her own room, andin the meantime Ulysses was getting his dinner. Then she called forthe swineherd and said, ""Eumaeus, go and tell the stranger to comehere, I want to see him and ask him some questions. He seems to havetravelled much, and he may have seen or heard something of myunhappy husband.""

ííííTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, ""If these Achaeans,Madam, would only keep quiet, you would be charmed with the history ofhis adventures. I had him three days and three nights with me in myhut, which was the first place he reached after running away fromhis ship, and he has not yet completed the story of his misfortunes.If he had been the most heaven-taught minstrel in the whole world,on whose lips all hearers hang entranced, I could not have been morecharmed as I sat in my hut and listened to him. He says there is anold friendship between his house and that of Ulysses, and that hecomes from Crete where the descendants of Minos live, after havingbeen driven hither and thither by every kind of misfortune; he alsodeclares that he has heard of Ulysses as being alive and near athand among the Thesprotians, and that he is bringing great wealth homewith him.""

íííí""Call him here, then,"" said Penelope, ""that I too may hear hisstory. As for the suitors, let them take their pleasure indoors or outas they will, for they have nothing to fret about. Their corn and wineremain unwasted in their houses with none but servants to consumethem, while they keep hanging about our house day after daysacrificing our oxen, sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, andnever giving so much as a thought to the quantity of wine theydrink. No estate can stand such recklessness, for we have now noUlysses to protect us. If he were to come again, he and his sonwould soon have their revenge.""

ííííAs she spoke Telemachus sneezed so loudly that the whole houseresounded with it. Penelope laughed when she heard this, and said toEumaeus, ""Go and call the stranger; did you not hear how my sonsneezed just as I was speaking? This can only mean that all thesuitors are going to be killed, and that not one of them shall escape.Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart: if I amsatisfied that the stranger is speaking the truth I shall give him ashirt and cloak of good wear.""

ííííWhen Eumaeus heard this he went straight to Ulysses and said,""Father stranger, my mistress Penelope, mother of Telemachus, has sentfor you; she is in great grief, but she wishes to hear anything youcan tell her about her husband, and if she is satisfied that you arespeaking the truth, she will give you a shirt and cloak, which are thevery things that you are most in want of. As for bread, you can getenough of that to fill your belly, by begging about the town, andletting those give that will.""

íííí""I will tell Penelope,"" answered Ulysses, ""nothing but what isstrictly true. I know all about her husband, and have been partnerwith him in affliction, but I am afraid of passing. through this crowdof cruel suitors, for their pride and insolence reach heaven. Justnow, moreover, as I was going about the house without doing anyharm, a man gave me a blow that hurt me very much, but neitherTelemachus nor any one else defended me. Tell Penelope, therefore,to be patient and wait till sundown. Let her give me a seat close upto the fire, for my clothes are worn very thin- you know they are, foryou have seen them ever since I first asked you to help me- she canthen ask me about the return of her husband.""

ííííThe swineherd went back when he heard this, and Penelope said as shesaw him cross the threshold, ""Why do you not bring him here,Eumaeus? Is he afraid that some one will ill-treat him, or is he shyof coming inside the house at all? Beggars should not be shamefaced.""

ííííTo this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, ""The stranger is quitereasonable. He is avoiding the suitors, and is only doing what any oneelse would do. He asks you to wait till sundown, and it will be muchbetter, madam, that you should have him all to yourself, when youcan hear him and talk to him as you will.""

íííí""The man is no fool,"" answered Penelope, ""it would very likely be ashe says, for there are no such abominable people in the whole world asthese men are.""

ííííWhen she had done speaking Eumaeus went back to the suitors, forhe had explained everything. Then he went up to Telemachus and said inhis ear so that none could overhear him, ""My dear sir, I will now goback to the pigs, to see after your property and my own business.You will look to what is going on here, but above all be careful tokeep out of danger, for there are many who bear you ill will. May Jovebring them to a bad end before they do us a mischief.""

íííí""Very well,"" replied Telemachus, ""go home when you have had yourdinner, and in the morning come here with the victims we are tosacrifice for the day. Leave the rest to heaven and me.""

ííííOn this Eumaeus took his seat again, and when he had finished hisdinner he left the courts and the cloister with the men at table,and went back to his pigs. As for the suitors, they presently began toamuse themselves with singing and dancing, for it was now getting ontowards evening.

ííííBOOK XVIII.

ííííNOW there came a certain common tramp who used to go begging allover the city of Ithaca, and was notorious as an incorrigibleglutton and drunkard. This man had no strength nor stay in him, but hewas a great hulking fellow to look at; his real name, the one hismother gave him, was Arnaeus, but the young men of the place calledhim Irus, because he used to run errands for any one who would sendhim. As soon as he came he began to insult Ulysses, and to try anddrive him out of his own house.

íííí""Be off, old man,"" he cried, ""from the doorway, or you shall bedragged out neck and heels. Do you not see that they are all giving methe wink, and wanting me to turn you out by force, only I do notlike to do so? Get up then, and go of yourself, or we shall come toblows.""

ííííUlysses frowned on him and said, ""My friend, I do you no manner ofharm; people give you a great deal, but I am not jealous. There isroom enough in this doorway for the pair of us, and you need notgrudge me things that are not yours to give. You seem to be justsuch another tramp as myself, but perhaps the gods will give us betterluck by and by. Do not, however, talk too much about fighting or youwill incense me, and old though I am, I shall cover your mouth andchest with blood. I shall have more peace to-morrow if I do, for youwill not come to the house of Ulysses any more.""

ííííIrus was very angry and answered, ""You filthy glutton, you run ontrippingly like an old fish-fag. I have a good mind to lay bothhands about you, and knock your teeth out of your head like so manyboar's tusks. Get ready, therefore, and let these people here stand byand look on. You will never be able to fight one who is so muchyounger than yourself.""

ííííThus roundly did they rate one another on the smooth pavement infront of the doorway, and when Antinous saw what was going on helaughed heartily and said to the others, ""This is the finest sportthat you ever saw; heaven never yet sent anything like it into thishouse. The stranger and Irus have quarreled and are going to fight,let us set them on to do so at once.""

ííííThe suitors all came up laughing, and gathered round the tworagged tramps. ""Listen to me,"" said Antinous, ""there are some goats'paunches down at the fire, which we have filled with blood and fat,and set aside for supper; he who is victorious and proves himself tobe the better man shall have his pick of the lot; he shall be freeof our table and we will not allow any other beggar about the house atall.""

ííííThe others all agreed, but Ulysses, to throw them off the scent,said, ""Sirs, an old man like myself, worn out with suffering, cannothold his own against a young one; but my irrepressible belly urgesme on, though I know it can only end in my getting a drubbing. Youmust swear, however that none of you will give me a foul blow tofavour Irus and secure him the victory.""

ííííThey swore as he told them, and when they had completed their oathTelemachus put in a word and said, ""Stranger, if you have a mind tosettle with this fellow, you need not be afraid of any one here.Whoever strikes you will have to fight more than one. I am host, andthe other chiefs, Antinous and Eurymachus, both of them men ofunderstanding, are of the same mind as I am.""

ííííEvery one assented, and Ulysses girded his old rags about his loins,thus baring his stalwart thighs, his broad chest and shoulders, andhis mighty arms; but Minerva came up to him and made his limbs evenstronger still. The suitors were beyond measure astonished, and onewould turn towards his neighbour saying, ""The stranger has broughtsuch a thigh out of his old rags that there will soon be nothingleft of Irus.""

ííííIrus began to be very uneasy as he heard them, but the servantsgirded him by force, and brought him [into the open part of the court]in such a fright that his limbs were all of a tremble. Antinousscolded him and said, ""You swaggering bully, you ought never to havebeen born at all if you are afraid of such an old broken-down creatureas this tramp is. I say, therefore- and it shall surely be- if hebeats you and proves himself the better man, I shall pack you off onboard ship to the mainland and send you to king Echetus, who killsevery one that comes near him. He will cut off your nose and ears, anddraw out your entrails for the dogs to eat.""

ííííThis frightened Irus still more, but they brought him into themiddle of the court, and the two men raised their hands to fight. ThenUlysses considered whether he should let drive so hard at him as tomake an end of him then and there, or whether he should give him alighter blow that should only knock him down; in the end he deemedit best to give the lighter blow for fear the Achaeans should begin tosuspect who he was. Then they began to fight, and Irus hit Ulysseson the right shoulder; but Ulysses gave Irus a blow on the neckunder the ear that broke in the bones of his skull, and the blood camegushing out of his mouth; he fell groaning in the dust, gnashing histeeth and kicking on the ground, but the suitors threw up theirhands and nearly died of laughter, as Ulysses caught hold of him bythe foot and dragged him into the outer court as far as thegate-house. There he propped him up against the wall and put his staffin his hands. ""Sit here,"" said he, ""and keep the dogs and pigs off;you are a pitiful creature, and if you try to make yourself king ofthe beggars any more you shall fare still worse.""

ííííThen he threw his dirty old wallet, all tattered and torn, overhis shoulder with the cord by which it hung, and went back to sit downupon the threshold; but the suitors went within the cloisters,laughing and saluting him, ""May Jove, and all the other gods,"" saidthey, 'grant you whatever you want for having put an end to theimportunity of this insatiable tramp. We will take him over to themainland presently, to king Echetus, who kills every one that comesnear him.""

ííííUlysses hailed this as of good omen, and Antinous set a great goat'spaunch before him filled with blood and fat. Amphinomus took twoloaves out of the bread-basket and brought them to him, pledging himas he did so in a golden goblet of wine. ""Good luck to you,"" hesaid, ""father stranger, you are very badly off at present, but Ihope you will have better times by and by.""

ííííTo this Ulysses answered, ""Amphinomus, you seem to be a man ofgood understanding, as indeed you may well be, seeing whose son youare. I have heard your father well spoken of; he is Nisus ofDulichium, a man both brave and wealthy. They tell me you are his son,and you appear to be a considerable person; listen, therefore, andtake heed to what I am saying. Man is the vainest of all creaturesthat have their being upon earth. As long as heaven vouchsafes himhealth and strength, he thinks that he shall come to no harmhereafter, and even when the blessed gods bring sorrow upon him, hebears it as he needs must, and makes the best of it; for GodAlmighty gives men their daily minds day by day. I know all aboutit, for I was a rich man once, and did much wrong in thestubbornness of my pride, and in the confidence that my father andmy brothers would support me; therefore let a man fear God in allthings always, and take the good that heaven may see fit to send himwithout vainglory. Consider the infamy of what these suitors aredoing; see how they are wasting the estate, and doing dishonour to thewife, of one who is certain to return some day, and that, too, notlong hence. Nay, he will be here soon; may heaven send you homequietly first that you may not meet with him in the day of his coming,for once he is here the suitors and he will not part bloodlessly.""

ííííWith these words he made a drink-offering, and when he had drunkhe put the gold cup again into the hands of Amphinomus, who walkedaway serious and bowing his head, for he foreboded evil. But even sohe did not escape destruction, for Minerva had doomed him fall bythe hand of Telemachus. So he took his seat again at the place fromwhich he had come.

ííííThen Minerva put it into the mind of Penelope to show herself to thesuitors, that she might make them still more enamoured of her, and winstill further honour from her son and husband. So she feigned amocking laugh and said, ""Eurynome, I have changed my and have afancy to show myself to the suitors although I detest them. I shouldlike also to give my son a hint that he had better not have anythingmore to do with them. They speak fairly enough but they meanmischief.""

íííí""My dear child,"" answered Eurynome, ""all that you have said is true,go and tell your son about it, but first wash yourself and anoint yourface. Do not go about with your cheeks all covered with tears; it isnot right that you should grieve so incessantly; for Telemachus,whom you always prayed that you might live to see with a beard, isalready grown up.""

íííí""I know, Eurynome,"" replied Penelope, ""that you mean well, but donot try and persuade me to wash and to anoint myself, for heavenrobbed me of all my beauty on the day my husband sailed; nevertheless,tell Autonoe and Hippodamia that I want them. They must be with mewhen I am in the cloister; I am not going among the men alone; itwould not be proper for me to do so.""

ííííOn this the old woman went out of the room to bid the maids go totheir mistress. In the meantime Minerva bethought her of anothermatter, and sent Penelope off into a sweet slumber; so she lay down onher couch and her limbs became heavy with sleep. Then the goddess shedgrace and beauty over her that all the Achaeans might admire her.She washed her face with the ambrosial loveliness that Venus wearswhen she goes dancing with the Graces; she made her taller and of amore commanding figure, while as for her complexion it was whiter thansawn ivory. When Minerva had done all this she went away, whereonthe maids came in from the women's room and woke Penelope with thesound of their talking.

íííí""What an exquisitely delicious sleep I have been having,"" saidshe, as she passed her hands over her face, ""in spite of all mymisery. I wish Diana would let me die so sweetly now at this verymoment, that I might no longer waste in despair for the loss of mydear husband, who possessed every kind of good quality and was themost distinguished man among the Achaeans.""

ííííWith these words she came down from her upper room, not alone butattended by two of her maidens, and when she reached the suitors shestood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister,holding a veil before her face, and with a staid maid servant oneither side of her. As they beheld her the suitors were so overpoweredand became so desperately enamoured of her, that each one prayed hemight win her for his own bed fellow.

íííí""Telemachus,"" said she, addressing her son, ""I fear you are nolonger so discreet and well conducted as you used to be. When you wereyounger you had a greater sense of propriety; now, however, that youare grown up, though a stranger to look at you would take you forthe son of a well-to-do father as far as size and good looks go,your conduct is by no means what it should be. What is all thisdisturbance that has been going on, and how came you to allow astranger to be so disgracefully ill-treated? What would havehappened if he had suffered serious injury while a suppliant in ourhouse? Surely this would have been very discreditable to you.""

íííí""I am not surprised, my dear mother, at your displeasure,"" repliedTelemachus, ""I understand all about it and know when things are not asthey should be, which I could not do when I was younger; I cannot,however, behave with perfect propriety at all times. First one andthen another of these wicked people here keeps driving me out of mymind, and I have no one to stand by me. After all, however, this fightbetween Irus and the stranger did not turn out as the suitors meant itto do, for the stranger got the best of it. I wish Father Jove,Minerva, and Apollo would break the neck of every one of thesewooers of yours, some inside the house and some out; and I wish theymight all be as limp as Irus is over yonder in the gate of the outercourt. See how he nods his head like a drunken man; he has had sucha thrashing that he cannot stand on his feet nor get back to his home,wherever that may be, for has no strength left in him.""

ííííThus did they converse. Eurymachus then came up and said, ""QueenPenelope, daughter of Icarius, if all the Achaeans in Iasian Argoscould see you at this moment, you would have still more suitors inyour house by tomorrow morning, for you are the most admirable womanin the whole world both as regards personal beauty and strength ofunderstanding.""

ííííTo this Penelope replied, ""Eurymachus, heaven robbed me of all mybeauty whether of face or figure when the Argives set sail for Troyand my dear husband with them. If he were to return and look aftermy affairs, I should both be more respected and show a better presenceto the world. As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with theafflictions which heaven has seen fit to heap upon me. My husbandforesaw it all, and when he was leaving home he took my right wrist inhis hand- 'Wife, 'he said, 'we shall not all of us come safe homefrom Troy, for the Trojans fight well both with bow and spear. Theyare excellent also at fighting from chariots, and nothing decidesthe issue of a fight sooner than this. I know not, therefore,whether heaven will send me back to you, or whether I may not fallover there at Troy. In the meantime do you look after things here.Take care of my father and mother as at present, and even more soduring my absence, but when you see our son growing a beard, thenmarry whom you will, and leave this your present home. This is what hesaid and now it is all coming true. A night will come when I shallhave to yield myself to a marriage which I detest, for Jove hastaken from me all hope of happiness. This further grief, moreover,cuts me to the very heart. You suitors are not wooing me after thecustom of my country. When men are courting a woman who they thinkwill be a good wife to them and who is of noble birth, and when theyare each trying to win her for himself, they usually bring oxen andsheep to feast the friends of the lady, and they make hermagnificent presents, instead of eating up other people's propertywithout paying for it.""

ííííThis was what she said, and Ulysses was glad when he heard hertrying to get presents out of the suitors, and flattering them withfair words which he knew she did not mean.

ííííThen Antinous said, ""Queen Penelope, daughter of Icarius, take asmany presents as you please from any one who will give them to you; itis not well to refuse a present; but we will not go about our businessnor stir from where we are, till you have married the best man amongus whoever he may be.""

ííííThe others applauded what Antinous had said, and each one sent hisservant to bring his present. Antinous's man returned with a large andlovely dress most exquisitely embroidered. It had twelve beautifullymade brooch pins of pure gold with which to fasten it. Eurymachusimmediately brought her a magnificent chain of gold and amber beadsthat gleamed like sunlight. Eurydamas's two men returned with someearrings fashioned into three brilliant pendants which glistenedmost beautifully; while king Pisander son of Polyctor gave her anecklace of the rarest workmanship, and every one else brought her abeautiful present of some kind.

ííííThen the queen went back to her room upstairs, and her maids broughtthe presents after her. Meanwhile the suitors took to singing anddancing, and stayed till evening came. They danced and sang till itgrew dark; they then brought in three braziers to give light, andpiled them up with chopped firewood very and dry, and they lit torchesfrom them, which the maids held up turn and turn about. Then Ulyssessaid:

íííí""Maids, servants of Ulysses who has so long been absent, go to thequeen inside the house; sit with her and amuse her, or spin, andpick wool. I will hold the light for all these people. They may staytill morning, but shall not beat me, for I can stand a great deal.""

ííííThe maids looked at one another and laughed, while pretty Melanthobegan to gibe at him contemptuously. She was daughter to Dolius, buthad been brought up by Penelope, who used to give her toys to playwith, and looked after her when she was a child; but in spite of allthis she showed no consideration for the sorrows of her mistress,and used to misconduct herself with Eurymachus, with whom she was inlove.

íííí""Poor wretch,"" said she, ""are you gone clean out of your mind? Goand sleep in some smithy, or place of public gossips, instead ofchattering here. Are you not ashamed of opening your mouth before yourbetters- so many of them too? Has the wine been getting into yourhead, or do you always babble in this way? You seem to have lostyour wits because you beat the tramp Irus; take care that a better manthan he does not come and cudgel you about the head till he pack youbleeding out of the house.""

íííí""Vixen,"" replied Ulysses, scowling at her, ""I will go and tellTelemachus what you have been saying, and he will have you torn limbfrom limb.""

ííííWith these words he scared the women, and they went off into thebody of the house. They trembled all aver, for they thought he woulddo as he said. But Ulysses took his stand near the burning braziers,holding up torches and looking at the people- brooding the while onthings that should surely come to pass.

ííííBut Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment cease theirinsolence, for she wanted Ulysses to become even more bitter againstthem; she therefore set Eurymachus son of Polybus on to gibe at him,which made the others laugh. ""Listen to me,"" said he, ""you suitorsof Queen Penelope, that I may speak even as I am minded. It is not fornothing that this man has come to the house of Ulysses; I believethe light has not been coming from the torches, but from his own head-for his hair is all gone, every bit of it.""

ííííThen turning to Ulysses he said, ""Stranger, will you work as aservant, if I send you to the wolds and see that you are well paid?Can you build a stone fence, or plant trees? I will have you fed allthe year round, and will find you in shoes and clothing. Will yougo, then? Not you; for you have got into bad ways, and do not wantto work; you had rather fill your belly by going round the countrybegging.""

íííí""Eurymachus,"" answered Ulysses, ""if you and I were to work oneagainst the other in early summer when the days are at theirlongest- give me a good scythe, and take another yourself, and letus see which will fast the longer or mow the stronger, from dawntill dark when the mowing grass is about. Or if you will ploughagainst me, let us each take a yoke of tawny oxen, well-mated and ofgreat strength and endurance: turn me into a four acre field, andsee whether you or I can drive the straighter furrow. If, again, warwere to break out this day, give me a shield, a couple of spears and ahelmet fitting well upon my temples- you would find me foremost in thefray, and would cease your gibes about my belly. You are insolentand cruel, and think yourself a great man because you live in a littleworld, ind that a bad one. If Ulysses comes to his own again, thedoors of his house are wide, but you will find them narrow when youtry to fly through them.""

ííííEurymachus was furious at all this. He scowled at him and cried,""You wretch, I will soon pay you out for daring to say such thingsto me, and in public too. Has the wine been getting into your heador do you always babble in this way? You seem to have lost your witsbecause you beat the tramp Irus. With this he caught hold of afootstool, but Ulysses sought protection at the knees of Amphinomus ofDulichium, for he was afraid. The stool hit the cupbearer on his righthand and knocked him down: the man fell with a cry flat on his back,and his wine-jug fell ringing to the ground. The suitors in thecovered cloister were now in an uproar, and one would turn towards hisneighbour, saying, ""I wish the stranger had gone somewhere else, badluck to hide, for all the trouble he gives us. We cannot permit suchdisturbance about a beggar; if such ill counsels are to prevail weshall have no more pleasure at our banquet.""

ííííOn this Telemachus came forward and said, ""Sirs, are you mad? Canyou not carry your meat and your liquor decently? Some evil spirit haspossessed you. I do not wish to drive any of you away, but you havehad your suppers, and the sooner you all go home to bed the better.""

ííííThe suitors bit their lips and marvelled at the boldness of hisspeech; but Amphinomus the son of Nisus, who was son to Aretias, said,""Do not let us take offence; it is reasonable, so let us make noanswer. Neither let us do violence to the stranger nor to any ofUlysses' servants. Let the cupbearer go round with thedrink-offerings, that we may make them and go home to our rest. As forthe stranger, let us leave Telemachus to deal with him, for it is tohis house that he has come.""

ííííThus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well, so Mulius ofDulichium, servant to Amphinomus, mixed them a bowl of wine andwater and handed it round to each of them man by man, whereon theymade their drink-offerings to the blessed gods: Then, when they hadmade their drink-offerings and had drunk each one as he was minded,they took their several ways each of them to his own abode.

ííííBOOK XIX.

ííííULYSSES was left in the cloister, pondering on the means wherebywith Minerva's help he might be able to kill the suitors. Presently hesaid to Telemachus, ""Telemachus, we must get the armour together andtake it down inside. Make some excuse when the suitors ask you why youhave removed it. Say that you have taken it to be out of the way ofthe smoke, inasmuch as it is no longer what it was when Ulysses wentaway, but has become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add to this moreparticularly that you are afraid Jove may set them on to quarrelover their wine, and that they may do each other some harm which maydisgrace both banquet and wooing, for the sight of arms sometimestempts people to use them.""

ííííTelemachus approved of what his father had said, so he callednurse Euryclea and said, ""Nurse, shut the women up in their room,while I take the armour that my father left behind him down into thestore room. No one looks after it now my father is gone, and it hasgot all smirched with soot during my own boyhood. I want to take itdown where the smoke cannot reach it.""

íííí""I wish, child,"" answered Euryclea, ""that you would take themanagement of the house into your own hands altogether, and look afterall the property yourself. But who is to go with you and light youto the store room? The maids would have so, but you would not letthem.

íííí""The stranger,"" said Telemachus, ""shall show me a light; when peopleeat my bread they must earn it, no matter where they come from.""

ííííEuryclea did as she was told, and bolted the women inside theirroom. Then Ulysses and his son made all haste to take the helmets,shields, and spears inside; and Minerva went before them with a goldlamp in her hand that shed a soft and brilliant radiance, whereonTelemachus said, ""Father, my eyes behold a great marvel: the walls,with the rafters, crossbeams, and the supports on which they restare all aglow as with a flaming fire. Surely there is some god herewho has come down from heaven.""

íííí""Hush,"" answered Ulysses, ""hold your peace and ask no questions, forthis is the manner of the gods. Get you to your bed, and leave me hereto talk with your mother and the maids. Your mother in her griefwill ask me all sorts of questions.""

ííííOn this Telemachus went by torch-light to the other side of theinner court, to the room in which he always slept. There he lay in hisbed till morning, while Ulysses was left in the cloister ponderingon the means whereby with Minerva's help he might be able to killthe suitors.

ííííThen Penelope came down from her room looking like Venus or Diana,and they set her a seat inlaid with scrolls of silver and ivory nearthe fire in her accustomed place. It had been made by Icmalius and hada footstool all in one piece with the seat itself; and it wascovered with a thick fleece: on this she now sat, and the maids camefrom the women's room to join her. They set about removing thetables at which the wicked suitors had been dining, and took awaythe bread that was left, with the cups from which they had drunk. Theyemptied the embers out of the braziers, and heaped much wood upon themto give both light and heat; but Melantho began to rail at Ulysses asecond time and said, ""Stranger, do you mean to plague us by hangingabout the house all night and spying upon the women? Be off, youwretch, outside, and eat your supper there, or you shall be driven outwith a firebrand.""

ííííUlysses scowled at her and answered, ""My good woman, why shouldyou be so angry with me? Is it because I am not clean, and myclothes are all in rags, and because I am obliged to go beggingabout after the manner of tramps and beggars generall? I too was arich man once, and had a fine house of my own; in those days I gave tomany a tramp such as I now am, no matter who he might be nor what hewanted. I had any number of servants, and all the other things whichpeople have who live well and are accounted wealthy, but it pleasedJove to take all away from me; therefore, woman, beware lest you toocome to lose that pride and place in which you now wanton above yourfellows; have a care lest you get out of favour with your mistress,and lest Ulysses should come home, for there is still a chance that hemay do so. Moreover, though he be dead as you think he is, yet byApollo's will he has left a son behind him, Telemachus, who willnote anything done amiss by the maids in the house, for he is now nolonger in his boyhood.""

ííííPenelope heard what he was saying and scolded the maid, ""Impudentbaggage, said she, ""I see how abominably you are behaving, and youshall smart for it. You knew perfectly well, for I told you myself,that I was going to see the stranger and ask him about my husband, forwhose sake I am in such continual sorrow.""

ííííThen she said to her head waiting woman Eurynome, ""Bring a seat witha fleece upon it, for the stranger to sit upon while he tells hisstory, and listens to what I have to say. I wish to ask him somequestions.""

ííííEurynome brought the seat at once and set a fleece upon it, and assoon as Ulysses had sat down Penelope began by saying, ""Stranger, Ishall first ask you who and whence are you? Tell me of your town andparents.""

íííí""Madam;"" answered Ulysses, ""who on the face of the whole earth candare to chide with you? Your fame reaches the firmament of heavenitself; you are like some blameless king, who upholds righteousness,as the monarch over a great and valiant nation: the earth yields itswheat and barley, the trees are loaded with fruit, the ewes bringforth lambs, and the sea abounds with fish by reason of his virtues,and his people do good deeds under him. Nevertheless, as I sit here inyour house, ask me some other question and do not seek to know my raceand family, or you will recall memories that will yet more increase mysorrow. I am full of heaviness, but I ought not to sit weeping andwailing in another person's house, nor is it well to be thusgrieving continually. I shall have one of the servants or evenyourself complaining of me, and saying that my eyes swim with tearsbecause I am heavy with wine.""

ííííThen Penelope answered, ""Stranger, heaven robbed me of all beauty,whether of face or figure, when the Argives set sail for Troy and mydear husband with them. If he were to return and look after my affairsI should be both more respected and should show a better presence tothe world. As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with theafflictions which heaven has seen fit to heap upon me. The chiefs fromall our islands- Dulichium, Same, and Zacynthus, as also from Ithacaitself, are wooing me against my will and are wasting my estate. I cantherefore show no attention to strangers, nor suppliants, nor topeople who say that they are skilled artisans, but am all the timebrokenhearted about Ulysses. They want me to marry again at once,and I have to invent stratagems in order to deceive them. In the firstplace heaven put it in my mind to set up a great tambour-frame in myroom, and to begin working upon an enormous piece of fineneedlework. Then I said to them, 'Sweethearts, Ulysses is indeed dead,still, do not press me to marry again immediately; wait- for I wouldnot have my skill in needlework perish unrecorded- till I havefinished making a pall for the hero Laertes, to be ready against thetime when death shall take him. He is very rich, and the women ofthe place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.' This was what Isaid, and they assented; whereon I used to keep working at my greatweb all day long, but at night I would unpick the stitches again bytorch light. I fooled them in this way for three years without theirfinding it out, but as time wore on and I was now in my fourth year,in the waning of moons, and many days had been accomplished, thosegood-for-nothing hussies my maids betrayed me to the suitors, whobroke in upon me and caught me; they were very angry with me, so I wasforced to finish my work whether I would or no. And now I do not seehow I can find any further shift for getting out of this marriage.My parents are putting great pressure upon me, and my son chafes atthe ravages the suitors are making upon his estate, for he is nowold enough to understand all about it and is perfectly able to lookafter his own affairs, for heaven has blessed him with an excellentdisposition. Still, notwithstanding all this, tell me who you areand where you come from- for you must have had father and mother ofsome sort; you cannot be the son of an oak or of a rock.""

ííííThen Ulysses answered, ""madam, wife of Ulysses, since you persist inasking me about my family, I will answer, no matter what it costsme: people must expect to be pained when they have been exiles as longas I have, and suffered as much among as many peoples. Nevertheless,as regards your question I will tell you all you ask. There is afair and fruitful island in mid-ocean called Crete; it is thicklypeopled and there are nine cities in it: the people speak manydifferent languages which overlap one another, for there are Achaeans,brave Eteocretans, Dorians of three-fold race, and noble Pelasgi.There is a great town there, Cnossus, where Minos reigned who everynine years had a conference with Jove himself. Minos was father toDeucalion, whose son I am, for Deucalion had two sons Idomeneus andmyself. Idomeneus sailed for Troy, and I, who am the younger, amcalled Aethon; my brother, however, was at once the older and the morevaliant of the two; hence it was in Crete that I saw Ulysses andshowed him hospitality, for the winds took him there as he was onhis way to Troy, carrying him out of his course from cape Malea andleaving him in Amnisus off the cave of Ilithuia, where the harboursare difficult to enter and he could hardly find shelter from the windsthat were then xaging. As soon as he got there he went into the townand asked for Idomeneus, claiming to be his old and valued friend, butIdomeneus had already set sail for Troy some ten or twelve daysearlier, so I took him to my own house and showed him every kind ofhospitality, for I had abundance of everything. Moreover, I fed themen who were with him with barley meal from the public store, andgot subscriptions of wine and oxen for them to sacrifice to theirheart's content. They stayed with me twelve days, for there was a galeblowing from the North so strong that one could hardly keep one's feeton land. I suppose some unfriendly god had raised it for them, buton the thirteenth day the wind dropped, and they got away.""

ííííMany a plausible tale did Ulysses further tell her, and Penelopewept as she listened, for her heart was melted. As the snow wastesupon the mountain tops when the winds from South East and West havebreathed upon it and thawed it till the rivers run bank full withwater, even so did her cheeks overflow with tears for the husbandwho was all the time sitting by her side. Ulysses felt for her and wasfor her, but he kept his eyes as hard as or iron without lettingthem so much as quiver, so cunningly did he restrain his tears.Then, when she had relieved herself by weeping, she turned to himagain and said: ""Now, stranger, I shall put you to the test and seewhether or no you really did entertain my husband and his men, asyou say you did. Tell me, then, how he was dressed, what kind of a manhe was to look at, and so also with his companions.""

íííí""Madam,"" answered Ulysses, ""it is such a long time ago that I canhardly say. Twenty years are come and gone since he left my home,and went elsewhither; but I will tell you as well as I canrecollect. Ulysses wore a mantle of purple wool, double lined, andit was fastened by a gold brooch with two catches for the pin. Onthe face of this there was a device that showed a dog holding aspotted fawn between his fore paws, and watching it as it laypanting upon the ground. Every one marvelled at the way in which thesethings had been done in gold, the dog looking at the fawn, andstrangling it, while the fawn was struggling convulsively to escape.As for the shirt that he wore next his skin, it was so soft that itfitted him like the skin of an onion, and glistened in the sunlight tothe admiration of all the women who beheld it. Furthermore I say,and lay my saying to your heart, that I do not know whether Ulysseswore these clothes when he left home, or whether one of his companionshad given them to him while he was on his voyage; or possibly some oneat whose house he was staying made him a present of them, for he was aman of many friends and had few equals among the Achaeans. I myselfgave him a sword of bronze and a beautiful purple mantle, doublelined, with a shirt that went down to his feet, and I sent him onboard his ship with every mark of honour. He had a servant with him, alittle older than himself, and I can tell you what he was like; hisshoulders were hunched, he was dark, and he had thick curly hair.His name was Eurybates, and Ulysses treated him with greaterfamiliarity than he did any of the others, as being the mostlike-minded with himself.""

ííííPenelope was moved still more deeply as she heard the indisputableproofs that Ulysses laid before her; and when she had again foundrelief in tears she said to him, ""Stranger, I was already disposedto pity you, but henceforth you shall be honoured and made welcomein my house. It was I who gave Ulysses the clothes you speak of. Itook them out of the store room and folded them up myself, and Igave him also the gold brooch to wear as an ornament. Alas! I shallnever welcome him home again. It was by an ill fate that he ever setout for that detested city whose very name I cannot bring myselfeven to mention.""

ííííThen Ulysses answered, ""Madam, wife of Ulysses, do not disfigureyourself further by grieving thus bitterly for your loss, though I canhardly blame you for doing so. A woman who has loved her husband andborne him children, would naturally be grieved at losing him, eventhough he were a worse man than Ulysses, who they say was like agod. Still, cease your tears and listen to what I can tell I will hidenothing from you, and can say with perfect truth that I have latelyheard of Ulysses as being alive and on his way home; he is among theThesprotians, and is bringing back much valuable treasure that hehas begged from one and another of them; but his ship and all his crewwere lost as they were leaving the Thrinacian island, for Jove and thesun-god were angry with him because his men had slaughtered thesun-god's cattle, and they were all drowned to a man. But Ulyssesstuck to the keel of the ship and was drifted on to the land of thePhaecians, who are near of kin to the immortals, and who treated himas though he had been a god, giving him many presents, and wishingto escort him home safe and sound. In fact Ulysses would have beenhere long ago, had he not thought better to go from land to landgathering wealth; for there is no man living who is so wily as heis; there is no one can compare with him. Pheidon king of theThesprotians told me all this, and he swore to me- makingdrink-offerings in his house as he did so- that the ship was by thewater side and the crew found who would take Ulysses to his owncountry. He sent me off first, for there happened to be aThesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing island of Dulichium,but he showed me all treasure Ulysses had got together, and he hadenough lying in the house of king Pheidon to keep his family for tengenerations; but the king said Ulysses had gone to Dodona that hemight learn Jove's mind from the high oak tree, and know whether afterso long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly or in secret.So you may know he is safe and will be here shortly; he is close athand and cannot remain away from home much longer; nevertheless I willconfirm my words with an oath, and call Jove who is the first andmightiest of all gods to witness, as also that hearth of Ulysses towhich I have now come, that all I have spoken shall surely come topass. Ulysses will return in this self same year; with the end of thismoon and the beginning of the next he will be here.""

íííí""May it be even so,"" answered Penelope; ""if your words come true youshall have such gifts and such good will from me that all who seeyou shall congratulate you; but I know very well how it will be.Ulysses will not return, neither will you get your escort hence, forso surely as that Ulysses ever was, there are now no longer any suchmasters in the house as he was, to receive honourable strangers orto further them on their way home. And now, you maids, wash his feetfor him, and make him a bed on a couch with rugs and blankets, that hemay be warm and quiet till morning. Then, at day break wash him andanoint him again, that he may sit in the cloister and take his mealswith Telemachus. It shall be the worse for any one of these hatefulpeople who is uncivil to him; like it or not, he shall have no more todo in this house. For how, sir, shall you be able to learn whetheror no I am superior to others of my sex both in goodness of heartand understanding, if I let you dine in my cloisters squalid and illclad? Men live but for a little season; if they are hard, and dealhardly, people wish them ill so long as they are alive, and speakcontemptuously of them when they are dead, but he that is righteousand deals righteously, the people tell of his praise among alllands, and many shall call him blessed.""

ííííUlysses answered, ""Madam, I have foresworn rugs and blankets fromthe day that I left the snowy ranges of Crete to go on shipboard. Iwill lie as I have lain on many a sleepless night hitherto. Nightafter night have I passed in any rough sleeping place, and waitedfor morning. Nor, again, do I like having my feet washed; I shallnot let any of the young hussies about your house touch my feet;but, if you have any old and respectable woman who has gone through asmuch trouble as I have, I will allow her to wash them.""

ííííTo this Penelope said, ""My dear sir, of all the guests who everyet came to my house there never was one who spoke in all thingswith such admirable propriety as you do. There happens to be in thehouse a most respectable old woman- the same who received my poor dearhusband in her arms the night he was born, and nursed him ininfancy. She is very feeble now, but she shall wash your feet.""""Come here,"" said she, ""Euryclea, and wash your master's age-mate; Isuppose Ulysses' hands and feet are very much the same now as his are,for trouble ages all of us dreadfully fast.""

ííííOn these words the old woman covered her face with her hands; shebegan to weep and made lamentation saying, ""My dear child, I cannotthink whatever I am to do with you. I am certain no one was evermore god-fearing than yourself, and yet Jove hates you. No one inthe whole world ever burned him more thigh bones, nor gave him finerhecatombs when you prayed you might come to a green old age yourselfand see your son grow up to take after you; yet see how he hasprevented you alone from ever getting back to your own home. I have nodoubt the women in some foreign palace which Ulysses has got to aregibing at him as all these sluts here have been gibing you. I do notwonder at your not choosing to let them wash you after the manner inwhich they have insulted you; I will wash your feet myself gladlyenough, as Penelope has said that I am to do so; I will wash them bothfor Penelope's sake and for your own, for you have raised the mostlively feelings of compassion in my mind; and let me say thismoreover, which pray attend to; we have had all kinds of strangersin distress come here before now, but I make bold to say that no oneever yet came who was so like Ulysses in figure, voice, and feet asyou are.""

íííí""Those who have seen us both,"" answered Ulysses, ""have always saidwe were wonderfully like each other, and now you have noticed it too.

ííííThen the old woman took the cauldron in which she was going towash his feet, and poured plenty of cold water into it, adding hottill the bath was warm enough. Ulysses sat by the fire, but ere longhe turned away from the light, for it occurred to him that when theold woman had hold of his leg she would recognize a certain scar whichit bore, whereon the whole truth would come out. And indeed as soon asshe began washing her master, she at once knew the scar as one thathad been given him by a wild boar when he was hunting on MountParnassus with his excellent grandfather Autolycus- who was the mostaccomplished thief and perjurer in the whole world- and with thesons of Autolycus. Mercury himself had endowed him with this gift, forhe used to burn the thigh bones of goats and kids to him, so he tookpleasure in his companionship. It happened once that Autolycus hadgone to Ithaca and had found the child of his daughter just born. Assoon as he had done supper Euryclea set the infant upon his kneesand said, you must find a name for your grandson; you greatly wishedthat you might have one.""

íííí'Son-in-law and daughter,"" replied Autolycus, ""call the childthus: I am highly displeased with a large number of people in oneplace and another, both men and women; so name the child 'Ulysses,' orthe child of anger. When he grows up and comes to visit his mother'sfamily on Mount Parnassus, where my possessions lie, I will make him apresent and will send him on his way rejoicing.""

ííííUlysses, therefore, went to Parnassus to get the presents fromAutolycus, who with his sons shook hands with him and gave himwelcome. His grandmother Amphithea threw her arms about him, andkissed his head, and both his beautiful eyes, while Autolycusdesired his sons to get dinner ready, and they did as he told them.They brought in a five year old bull, flayed it, made it ready anddivided it into joints; these they then cut carefully up intosmaller pieces and spitted them; they roasted them sufficiently andserved the portions round. Thus through the livelong day to thegoing down of the sun they feasted, and every man had his full shareso that all were satisfied; but when the sun set and it came ondark, they went to bed and enjoyed the boon of sleep.

ííííWhen the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the sons ofAutolycus went out with their hounds hunting, and Ulysses went too.They climbed the wooded slopes of Parnassus and soon reached itsbreezy upland valleys; but as the sun was beginning to beat upon thefields, fresh-risen from the slow still currents of Oceanus, they cameto a mountain dell. The dogs were in front searching for the tracks ofthe beast they were chasing, and after them came the sons ofAutolycus, among whom was Ulysses, close behind the dogs, and he had along spear in his hand. Here was the lair of a huge boar among somethick brushwood, so dense that the wind and rain could not get throughit, nor could the sun's rays pierce it, and the ground underneathlay thick with fallen leaves. The boar heard the noise of the men'sfeet, and the hounds baying on every side as the huntsmen came up tohim, so rushed from his lair, raised the bristles on his neck, andstood at bay with fire flashing from his eyes. Ulysses was the firstto raise his spear and try to drive it into the brute, but the boarwas too quick for him, and charged him sideways, ripping him above theknee with a gash that tore deep though it did not reach the bone. Asfor the boar, Ulysses hit him on the right shoulder, and the pointof the spear went right through him, so that he fell groaning in thedust until the life went out of him. The sons of Autolycus busiedthemselves with the carcass of the boar, and bound Ulysses' wound;then, after saying a spell to stop the bleeding, they went home asfast as they could. But when Autolycus and his sons had thoroughlyhealed Ulysses, they made him some splendid presents, and sent himback to Ithaca with much mutual good will. When he got back, hisfather and mother were rejoiced to see him, and asked him all aboutit, and how he had hurt himself to get the scar; so he told them howthe boar had ripped him when he was out hunting with Autolycus and hissons on Mount Parnassus.

ííííAs soon as Euryclea had got the scarred limb in her hands and hadwell hold of it, she recognized it and dropped the foot at once. Theleg fell into the bath, which rang out and was overturned, so that allthe water was spilt on the ground; Euryclea's eyes between her joy andher grief filled with tears, and she could not speak, but she caughtUlysses by the beard and said, ""My dear child, I am sure you must beUlysses himself, only I did not know you till I had actually touchedand handled you.""

ííííAs she spoke she looked towards Penelope, as though wanting totell her that her dear husband was in the house, but Penelope wasunable to look in that direction and observe what was going on, forMinerva had diverted her attention; so Ulysses caught Euryclea bythe throat with his right hand and with his left drew her close tohim, and said, ""Nurse, do you wish to be the ruin of me, you whonursed me at your own breast, now that after twenty years of wanderingI am at last come to my own home again? Since it has been borne inupon you by heaven to recognize me, hold your tongue, and do not say aword about it any one else in the house, for if you do I tell you- andit shall surely be- that if heaven grants me to take the lives ofthese suitors, I will not spare you, though you are my own nurse, whenI am killing the other women.""

íííí""My child,"" answered Euryclea, ""what are you talking about? You knowvery well that nothing can either bend or break me. I will hold mytongue like a stone or a piece of iron; furthermore let me say, andlay my saying to your heart, when heaven has delivered the suitorsinto your hand, I will give you a list of the women in the house whohave been ill-behaved, and of those who are guiltless.""

ííííAnd Ulysses answered, ""Nurse, you ought not to speak in that way;I am well able to form my own opinion about one and all of them;hold your tongue and leave everything to heaven.""

ííííAs he said this Euryclea left the cloister to fetch some more water,for the first had been all spilt; and when she had washed him andanointed him with oil, Ulysses drew his seat nearer to the fire towarm himself, and hid the scar under his rags. Then Penelope begantalking to him and said:

íííí""Stranger, I should like to speak with you briefly about anothermatter. It is indeed nearly bed time- for those, at least, who cansleep in spite of sorrow. As for myself, heaven has given me a life ofsuch unmeasurable woe, that even by day when I am attending to myduties and looking after the servants, I am still weeping andlamenting during the whole time; then, when night comes, and we all ofus go to bed, I lie awake thinking, and my heart comes a prey to themost incessant and cruel tortures. As the dun nightingale, daughter ofPandareus, sings in the early spring from her seat in shadiestcovert hid, and with many a plaintive trill pours out the tale howby mishap she killed her own child Itylus, son of king Zethus, even sodoes my mind toss and turn in its uncertainty whether I ought tostay with my son here, and safeguard my substance, my bondsmen, andthe greatness of my house, out of regard to public opinion and thememory of my late husband, or whether it is not now time for me togo with the best of these suitors who are wooing me and making me suchmagnificent presents. As long as my son was still young, and unable tounderstand, he would not hear of my leaving my husband's house, butnow that he is full grown he begs and prays me to do so, beingincensed at the way in which the suitors are eating up his property.Listen, then, to a dream that I have had and interpret it for me ifyou can. I have twenty geese about the house that eat mash out of atrough, and of which I am exceedingly fond. I dreamed that a greateagle came swooping down from a mountain, and dug his curved beak intothe neck of each of them till he had killed them all. Presently hesoared off into the sky, and left them lying dead about the yard;whereon I wept in my room till all my maids gathered round me, sopiteously was I grieving because the eagle had killed my geese. Thenhe came back again, and perching on a projecting rafter spoke to mewith human voice, and told me to leave off crying. 'Be of goodcourage,' he said, 'daughter of Icarius; this is no dream, but avision of good omen that shall surely come to pass. The geese arethe suitors, and I am no longer an eagle, but your own husband, who amcome back to you, and who will bring these suitors to a disgracefulend.' On this I woke, and when I looked out I saw my geese at thetrough eating their mash as usual.""

íííí""This dream, Madam,"" replied Ulysses, ""can admit but of oneinterpretation, for had not Ulysses himself told you how it shall befulfilled? The death of the suitors is portended, and not one singleone of them will escape.""

ííííAnd Penelope answered, ""Stranger, dreams are very curious andunaccountable things, and they do not by any means invariably cometrue. There are two gates through which these unsubstantial fanciesproceed; the one is of horn, and the other ivory. Those that comethrough the gate of ivory are fatuous, but those from the gate of hornmean something to those that see them. I do not think, however, thatmy own dream came through the gate of horn, though I and my son shouldbe most thankful if it proves to have done so. Furthermore I say-and lay my saying to your heart- the coming dawn will usher in theill-omened day that is to sever me from the house of Ulysses, for I amabout to hold a tournament of axes. My husband used to set up twelveaxes in the court, one in front of the other, like the stays uponwhich a ship is built; he would then go back from them and shoot anarrow through the whole twelve. I shall make the suitors try to do thesame thing, and whichever of them can string the bow most easily,and send his arrow through all the twelve axes, him will I follow, andquit this house of my lawful husband, so goodly and so abounding inwealth. But even so, I doubt not that I shall remember it in mydreams.""

ííííThen Ulysses answered, ""Madam wife of Ulysses, you need not deferyour tournament, for Ulysses will return ere ever they can stringthe bow, handle it how they will, and send their arrows through theiron.""

ííííTo this Penelope said, ""As long, sir, as you will sit here andtalk to me, I can have no desire to go to bed. Still, people cannot dopermanently without sleep, and heaven has appointed us dwellers onearth a time for all things. I will therefore go upstairs andrecline upon that couch which I have never ceased to flood with mytears from the day Ulysses set out for the city with a hateful name.""

ííííShe then went upstairs to her own room, not alone, but attended byher maidens, and when there, she lamented her dear husband tillMinerva shed sweet sleep over her eyelids.

ííííBOOK XX.

ííííULYSSES slept in the cloister upon an undressed bullock's hide, onthe top of which he threw several skins of the sheep the suitors hadeaten, and Eurynome threw a cloak over him after he had laid himselfdown. There, then, Ulysses lay wakefully brooding upon the way inwhich he should kill the suitors; and by and by, the women who hadbeen in the habit of misconducting themselves with them, left thehouse giggling and laughing with one another. This made Ulysses veryangry, and he doubted whether to get up and kill every single one ofthem then and there, or to let them sleep one more and last timewith the suitors. His heart growled within him, and as a bitch withpuppies growls and shows her teeth when she sees a stranger, so didhis heart growl with anger at the evil deeds that were being done: buthe beat his breast and said, ""Heart, be still, you had worse than thisto bear on the day when the terrible Cyclops ate your bravecompanions; yet you bore it in silence till your cunning got yousafe out of the cave, though you made sure of being killed.""

ííííThus he chided with his heart, and checked it into endurance, but hetossed about as one who turns a paunch full of blood and fat infront of a hot fire, doing it first on one side and then on the other,that he may get it cooked as soon as possible, even so did he turnhimself about from side to side, thinking all the time how, singlehanded as he was, he should contrive to kill so large a body of men asthe wicked suitors. But by and by Minerva came down from heaven in thelikeness of a woman, and hovered over his head saying, ""My poorunhappy man, why do you lie awake in this way? This is your house:your wife is safe inside it, and so is your son who is just such ayoung man as any father may be proud of.""

íííí""Goddess,"" answered Ulysses, ""all that you have said is true, butI am in some doubt as to how I shall be able to kill these wickedsuitors single handed, seeing what a number of them there alwaysare. And there is this further difficulty, which is still moreconsiderable. Supposing that with Jove's and your assistance I succeedin killing them, I must ask you to consider where I am to escape tofrom their avengers when it is all over.""

íííí""For shame,"" replied Minerva, ""why, any one else would trust a worseally than myself, even though that ally were only a mortal and lesswise than I am. Am I not a goddess, and have I not protected youthroughout in all your troubles? I tell you plainly that even thoughthere were fifty bands of men surrounding us and eager to kill us, youshould take all their sheep and cattle, and drive them away withyou. But go to sleep; it is a very bad thing to lie awake all night,and you shall be out of your troubles before long.""

ííííAs she spoke she shed sleep over his eyes, and then went back toOlympus.

ííííWhile Ulysses was thus yielding himself to a very deep slumberthat eased the burden of his sorrows, his admirable wife awoke, andsitting up in her bed began to cry. When she had relieved herself byweeping she prayed to Diana saying, ""Great Goddess Diana, daughterof Jove, drive an arrow into my heart and slay me; or let somewhirlwind snatch me up and bear me through paths of darkness till itdrop me into the mouths of overflowing Oceanus, as it did thedaughters of Pandareus. The daughters of Pandareus lost their fatherand mother, for the gods killed them, so they were left orphans. ButVenus took care of them, and fed them on cheese, honey, and sweetwine. Juno taught them to excel all women in beauty of form andunderstanding; Diana gave them an imposing presence, and Minervaendowed them with every kind of accomplishment; but one day when Venushad gone up to Olympus to see Jove about getting them married (forwell does he know both what shall happen and what not happen toevery one) the storm winds came and spirited them away to becomehandmaids to the dread Erinyes. Even so I wish that the gods wholive in heaven would hide me from mortal sight, or that fair Dianamight strike me, for I would fain go even beneath the sad earth if Imight do so still looking towards Ulysses only, and without havingto yield myself to a worse man than he was. Besides, no matter howmuch people may grieve by day, they can put up with it so long as theycan sleep at night, for when the eyes are closed in slumber peopleforget good and ill alike; whereas my misery haunts me even in mydreams. This very night methought there was one lying by my side whowas like Ulysses as he was when he went away with his host, and Irejoiced, for I believed that it was no dream, but the very truthitself.""

ííííOn this the day broke, but Ulysses heard the sound of her weeping,and it puzzled him, for it seemed as though she already knew him andwas by his side. Then he gathered up the cloak and the fleeces onwhich he had lain, and set them on a seat in the cloister, but he tookthe bullock's hide out into the open. He lifted up his hands toheaven, and prayed, saying ""Father Jove, since you have seen fit tobring me over land and sea to my own home after all the afflictionsyou have laid upon me, give me a sign out of the mouth of some oneor other of those who are now waking within the house, and let me haveanother sign of some kind from outside.""

ííííThus did he pray. Jove heard his prayer and forthwith thundered highup among the from the splendour of Olympus, and Ulysses was gladwhen he heard it. At the same time within the house, a miller-womanfrom hard by in the mill room lifted up her voice and gave him anothersign. There were twelve miller-women whose business it was to grindwheat and barley which are the staff of life. The others had groundtheir task and had gone to take their rest, but this one had not yetfinished, for she was not so strong as they were, and when she heardthe thunder she stopped grinding and gave the sign to her master.""Father Jove,"" said she, ""you who rule over heaven and earth, you havethundered from a clear sky without so much as a cloud in it, andthis means something for somebody; grant the prayer, then, of meyour poor servant who calls upon you, and let this be the very lastday that the suitors dine in the house of Ulysses. They have worn meout with the labour of grinding meal for them, and I hope they maynever have another dinner anywhere at all.""

ííííUlysses was glad when he heard the omens conveyed to him by thewoman's speech, and by the thunder, for he knew they meant that heshould avenge himself on the suitors.

ííííThen the other maids in the house rose and lit the fire on thehearth; Telemachus also rose and put on his clothes. He girded hissword about his shoulder, bound his sandals on his comely feet, andtook a doughty spear with a point of sharpened bronze; then he went tothe threshold of the cloister and said to Euryclea, ""Nurse, did youmake the stranger comfortable both as regards bed and board, or didyou let him shift for himself?- for my mother, good woman though sheis, has a way of paying great attention to second-rate people, andof neglecting others who are in reality much better men.""

íííí""Do not find fault child,"" said Euryclea, ""when there is no one tofind fault with. The stranger sat and drank his wine as long as heliked: your mother did ask him if he would take any more bread andhe said he would not. When he wanted to go to bed she told theservants to make one for him, but he said he was re such wretchedoutcast that he would not sleep on a bed and under blankets; heinsisted on having an undressed bullock's hide and some sheepskins putfor him in the cloister and I threw a cloak over him myself.""

ííííThen Telemachus went out of the court to the place where theAchaeans were meeting in assembly; he had his spear in his hand, andhe was not alone, for his two dogs went with him. But Eurycleacalled the maids and said, ""Come, wake up; set about sweeping thecloisters and sprinkling them with water to lay the dust; put thecovers on the seats; wipe down the tables, some of you, with a wetsponge; clean out the mixing-jugs and the cups, and for water from thefountain at once; the suitors will be here directly; they will be hereearly, for it is a feast day.""

ííííThus did she speak, and they did even as she had said: twenty ofthem went to the fountain for water, and the others set themselvesbusily to work about the house. The men who were in attendance onthe suitors also came up and began chopping firewood. By and by thewomen returned from the fountain, and the swineherd came after themwith the three best pigs he could pick out. These he let feed aboutthe premises, and then he said good-humouredly to Ulysses,""Stranger, are the suitors treating you any better now, or are they asinsolent as ever?""

íííí""May heaven,"" answered Ulysses, ""requite to them the wickedness withwhich they deal high-handedly in another man's house without any senseof shame.""

ííííThus did they converse; meanwhile Melanthius the goatherd came up,for he too was bringing in his best goats for the suitors' dinner; andhe had two shepherds with him. They tied the goats up under thegatehouse, and then Melanthius began gibing at Ulysses. ""Are you stillhere, stranger,"" said he, ""to pester people by begging about thehouse? Why can you not go elsewhere? You and I shall not come to anunderstanding before we have given each other a taste of our fists.You beg without any sense of decency: are there not feasts elsewhereamong the Achaeans, as well as here?""

ííííUlysses made no answer, but bowed his head and brooded. Then a thirdman, Philoetius, joined them, who was bringing in a barren heiferand some goats. These were brought over by the boatmen who are thereto take people over when any one comes to them. So Philoetius made hisheifer and his goats secure under the gatehouse, and then went up tothe swineherd. ""Who, Swineherd,"" said he, ""is this stranger that islately come here? Is he one of your men? What is his family? Wheredoes he come from? Poor fellow, he looks as if he had been somegreat man, but the gods give sorrow to whom they will- even to kingsif it so pleases them

ííííAs he spoke he went up to Ulysses and saluted him with his righthand; ""Good day to you, father stranger,"" said he, ""you seem to bevery poorly off now, but I hope you will have better times by andby. Father Jove, of all gods you are the most malicious. We are yourown children, yet you show us no mercy in all our misery andafflictions. A sweat came over me when I saw this man, and my eyesfilled with tears, for he reminds me of Ulysses, who I fear is goingabout in just such rags as this man's are, if indeed he is still amongthe living. If he is already dead and in the house of Hades, then,alas! for my good master, who made me his stockman when I was quiteyoung among the Cephallenians, and now his cattle are countless; noone could have done better with them than I have, for they have bredlike ears of corn; nevertheless I have to keep bringing them in forothers to eat, who take no heed of his son though he is in thehouse, and fear not the wrath of heaven, but are already eager todivide Ulysses' property among them because he has been away solong. I have often thought- only it would not be right while his sonis living- of going off with the cattle to some foreign country; badas this would be, it is still harder to stay here and be ill-treatedabout other people's herds. My position is intolerable, and I shouldlong since have run away and put myself under the protection of someother chief, only that I believe my poor master will yet return, andsend all these suitors flying out of the house.""

íííí""Stockman,"" answered Ulysses, ""you seem to be a very well-disposedperson, and I can see that you are a man of sense. Therefore I willtell you, and will confirm my words with an oath: by Jove, the chiefof all gods, and by that hearth of Ulysses to which I am now come,Ulysses shall return before you leave this place, and if you are sominded you shall see him killing the suitors who are now mastershere.""

íííí""If Jove were to bring this to pass,"" replied the stockman, ""youshould see how I would do my very utmost to help him.""

ííííAnd in like manner Eumaeus prayed that Ulysses might return home.

ííííThus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were hatching a plotto murder Telemachus: but a bird flew near them on their left hand- aneagle with a dove in its talons. On this Amphinomus said, ""My friends,this plot of ours to murder Telemachus will not succeed; let us goto dinner instead.""

ííííThe others assented, so they went inside and laid their cloaks onthe benches and seats. They sacrificed the sheep, goats, pigs, and theheifer, and when the inward meats were cooked they served themround. They mixed the wine in the mixing-bowls, and the swineherd gaveevery man his cup, while Philoetius handed round the bread in thebreadbaskets, and Melanthius poured them out their wine. Then theylaid their hands upon the good things that were before them.

ííííTelemachus purposely made Ulysses sit in the part of the cloisterthat was paved with stone; he gave him a shabby-looking seat at alittle table to himself, and had his portion of the inward meatsbrought to him, with his wine in a gold cup. ""Sit there,"" said he,""and drink your wine among the great people. I will put a stop tothe gibes and blows of the suitors, for this is no public house, butbelongs to Ulysses, and has passed from him to me. Therefore, suitors,keep your hands and your tongues to yourselves, or there will bemischief.""

ííííThe suitors bit their lips, and marvelled at the boldness of hisspeech; then Antinous said, ""We do not like such language but wewill put up with it, for Telemachus is threatening us in good earnest.If Jove had let us we should have put a stop to his brave talk erenow.""

ííííThus spoke Antinous, but Telemachus heeded him not. Meanwhile theheralds were bringing the holy hecatomb through the city, and theAchaeans gathered under the shady grove of Apollo.

ííííThen they roasted the outer meat, drew it off the spits, gaveevery man his portion, and feasted to their hearts' content; those whowaited at table gave Ulysses exactly the same portion as the othershad, for Telemachus had told them to do so.

ííííBut Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment drop theirinsolence, for she wanted Ulysses to become still more bitteragainst them. Now there happened to be among them a ribald fellow,whose name was Ctesippus, and who came from Same. This man,confident in his great wealth, was paying court to the wife ofUlysses, and said to the suitors, ""Hear what I have to say. Thestranger has already had as large a portion as any one else; this iswell, for it is not right nor reasonable to ill-treat any guest ofTelemachus who comes here. I will, however, make him a present on myown account, that he may have something to give to the bath-woman,or to some other of Ulysses' servants.""

ííííAs he spoke he picked up a heifer's foot from the meat-basket inwhich it lay, and threw it at Ulysses, but Ulysses turned his head alittle aside, and avoided it, smiling grimly Sardinian fashion as hedid so, and it hit the wall, not him. On this Telemachus spokefiercely to Ctesippus, ""It is a good thing for you,"" said he, ""thatthe stranger turned his head so that you missed him. If you had hithim I should have run you through with my spear, and your father wouldhave had to see about getting you buried rather than married in thishouse. So let me have no more unseemly behaviour from any of you,for I am grown up now to the knowledge of good and evil and understandwhat is going on, instead of being the child that I have beenheretofore. I have long seen you killing my sheep and making free withmy corn and wine: I have put up with this, for one man is no match formany, but do me no further violence. Still, if you wish to kill me,kill me; I would far rather die than see such disgraceful scenes dayafter day- guests insulted, and men dragging the women servantsabout the house in an unseemly way.""

ííííThey all held their peace till at last Agelaus son of Damastor said,""No one should take offence at what has just been said, nor gainsayit, for it is quite reasonable. Leave off, therefore, ill-treating thestranger, or any one else of the servants who are about the house; Iwould say, however, a friendly word to Telemachus and his mother,which I trust may commend itself to both. 'As long,' I would say,'as you had ground for hoping that Ulysses would one day come home, noone could complain of your waiting and suffering the suitors to bein your house. It would have been better that he should have returned,but it is now sufficiently clear that he will never do so; thereforetalk all this quietly over with your mother, and tell her to marry thebest man, and the one who makes her the most advantageous offer.Thus you will yourself be able to manage your own inheritance, andto eat and drink in peace, while your mother will look after someother man's house, not yours.""'

ííííTo this Telemachus answered, ""By Jove, Agelaus, and by the sorrowsof my unhappy father, who has either perished far from Ithaca, or iswandering in some distant land, I throw no obstacles in the way ofmy mother's marriage; on the contrary I urge her to choosewhomsoever she will, and I will give her numberless gifts into thebargain, but I dare not insist point blank that she shall leave thehouse against her own wishes. Heaven forbid that I should do this.""

ííííMinerva now made the suitors fall to laughing immoderately, andset their wits wandering; but they were laughing with a forcedlaughter. Their meat became smeared with blood; their eyes filled withtears, and their hearts were heavy with forebodings. Theoclymenussaw this and said, ""Unhappy men, what is it that ails you? There isa shroud of darkness drawn over you from head to foot, your cheeks arewet with tears; the air is alive with wailing voices; the walls androof-beams drip blood; the gate of the cloisters and the courtbeyond them are full of ghosts trooping down into the night of hell;the sun is blotted out of heaven, and a blighting gloom is over allthe land.""

ííííThus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily. Eurymachusthen said, ""This stranger who has lately come here has lost hissenses. Servants, turn him out into the streets, since he finds itso dark here.""

ííííBut Theoclymenus said, ""Eurymachus, you need not send any one withme. I have eyes, ears, and a pair of feet of my own, to say nothing ofan understanding mind. I will take these out of the house with me, forI see mischief overhanging you, from which not one of you men whoare insulting people and plotting ill deeds in the house of Ulysseswill be able to escape.""

ííííHe left the house as he spoke, and went back to Piraeus who gave himwelcome, but the suitors kept looking at one another and provokingTelemachus fly laughing at the strangers. One insolent fellow saidto him, ""Telemachus, you are not happy in your guests; first youhave this importunate tramp, who comes begging bread and wine andhas no skill for work or for hard fighting, but is perfectlyuseless, and now here is another fellow who is setting himself up as aprophet. Let me persuade you, for it will be much better, to putthem on board ship and send them off to the Sicels to sell for whatthey will bring.""

ííííTelemachus gave him no heed, but sat silently watching his father,expecting every moment that he would begin his attack upon thesuitors.

ííííMeanwhile the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, had had had a richseat placed for her facing the court and cloisters, so that shecould hear what every one was saying. The dinner indeed had beenprepared amid merriment; it had been both good and abundant, forthey had sacrificed many victims; but the supper was yet to come,and nothing can be conceived more gruesome than the meal which agoddess and a brave man were soon to lay before them- for they hadbrought their doom upon themselves.

ííííBOOK XXI.

ííííMINERVA now put it in Penelope's mind to make the suitors trytheir skill with the bow and with the iron axes, in contest amongthemselves, as a means of bringing about their destruction. She wentupstairs and got the store room key, which was made of bronze andhad a handle of ivory; she then went with her maidens into the storeroom at the end of the house, where her husband's treasures of gold,bronze, and wrought iron were kept, and where was also his bow, andthe quiver full of deadly arrows that had been given him by a friendwhom he had met in Lacedaemon- Iphitus the son of Eurytus. The twofell in with one another in Messene at the house of Ortilochus,where Ulysses was staying in order to recover a debt that was owingfrom the whole people; for the Messenians had carried off threehundred sheep from Ithaca, and had sailed away with them and withtheir shepherds. In quest of these Ulysses took a long journey whilestill quite young, for his father and the other chieftains sent him ona mission to recover them. Iphitus had gone there also to try andget back twelve brood mares that he had lost, and the mule foalsthat were running with them. These mares were the death of him inthe end, for when he went to the house of Jove's son, mighty Hercules,who performed such prodigies of valour, Hercules to his shame killedhim, though he was his guest, for he feared not heaven's vengeance,nor yet respected his own table which he had set before Iphitus, butkilled him in spite of everything, and kept the mares himself. Itwas when claiming these that Iphitus met Ulysses, and gave him the bowwhich mighty Eurytus had been used to carry, and which on his deathhad been left by him to his son. Ulysses gave him in return a swordand a spear, and this was the beginning of a fast friendship, althoughthey never visited at one another's houses, for Jove's son Herculeskilled Iphitus ere they could do so. This bow, then, given him byIphitus, had not been taken with him by Ulysses when he sailed forTroy; he had used it so long as he had been at home, but had left itbehind as having been a keepsake from a valued friend.

ííííPenelope presently reached the oak threshold of the store room;the carpenter had planed this duly, and had drawn a line on it so asto get it quite straight; he had then set the door posts into it andhung the doors. She loosed the strap from the handle of the door,put in the key, and drove it straight home to shoot back the boltsthat held the doors; these flew open with a noise like a bullbellowing in a meadow, and Penelope stepped upon the raisedplatform, where the chests stood in which the fair linen and clotheswere laid by along with fragrant herbs: reaching thence, she took downthe bow with its bow case from the peg on which it hung. She satdown with it on her knees, weeping bitterly as she took the bow out ofits case, and when her tears had relieved her, she went to thecloister where the suitors were, carrying the bow and the quiver, withthe many deadly arrows that were inside it. Along with her came hermaidens, bearing a chest that contained much iron and bronze which herhusband had won as prizes. When she reached the suitors, she stoodby one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister,holding a veil before her face, and with a maid on either side of her.Then she said:

íííí""Listen to me you suitors, who persist in abusing the hospitality ofthis house because its owner has been long absent, and without otherpretext than that you want to marry me; this, then, being the prizethat you are contending for, I will bring out the mighty bow ofUlysses, and whomsoever of you shall string it most easily and sendhis arrow through each one of twelve axes, him will I follow andquit this house of my lawful husband, so goodly, and so abounding inwealth. But even so I doubt not that I shall remember it in mydreams.""

ííííAs she spoke, she told Eumaeus to set the bow and the pieces of ironbefore the suitors, and Eumaeus wept as he took them to do as shehad bidden him. Hard by, the stockman wept also when he saw hismaster's bow, but Antinous scolded them. ""You country louts,"" said he,""silly simpletons; why should you add to the sorrows of yourmistress by crying in this way? She has enough to grieve her in theloss of her husband; sit still, therefore, and eat your dinners insilence, or go outside if you want to cry, and leave the bow behindyou. We suitors shall have to contend for it with might and main,for we shall find it no light matter to string such a bow as thisis. There is not a man of us all who is such another as Ulysses; for Ihave seen him and remember him, though I was then only a child.""

ííííThis was what he said, but all the time he was expecting to beable to string the bow and shoot through the iron, whereas in facthe was to be the first that should taste of the arrows from thehands of Ulysses, whom he was dishonouring in his own house- eggingthe others on to do so also.

ííííThen Telemachus spoke. ""Great heavens!"" he exclaimed, ""Jove musthave robbed me of my senses. Here is my dear and excellent mothersaying she will quit this house and marry again, yet I am laughing andenjoying myself as though there were nothing happening. But,suitors, as the contest has been agreed upon, let it go forward. It isfor a woman whose peer is not to be found in Pylos, Argos, orMycene, nor yet in Ithaca nor on the mainland. You know this as wellas I do; what need have I to speak in praise of my mother? Come on,then, make no excuses for delay, but let us see whether you can stringthe bow or no. I too will make trial of it, for if I can string it andshoot through the iron, I shall not suffer my mother to quit thishouse with a stranger, not if I can win the prizes which my father wonbefore me.""

ííííAs he spoke he sprang from his seat, threw his crimson cloak fromhim, and took his sword from his shoulder. First he set the axes ina row, in a long groove which he had dug for them, and had Wadestraight by line. Then he stamped the earth tight round them, andeveryone was surprised when they saw him set up so orderly, thoughhe had never seen anything of the kind before. This done, he went onto the pavement to make trial of the bow; thrice did he tug at it,trying with all his might to draw the string, and thrice he had toleave off, though he had hoped to string the bow and shoot through theiron. He was trying for the fourth time, and would have strung ithad not Ulysses made a sign to check him in spite of all hiseagerness. So he said:

íííí""Alas! I shall either be always feeble and of no prowess, or I amtoo young, and have not yet reached my full strength so as to beable to hold my own if any one attacks me. You others, therefore,who are stronger than I, make trial of the bow and get this contestsettled.""

ííííOn this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door[that led into the house] with the arrow standing against the top ofthe bow. Then he sat down on the seat from which he had risen, andAntinous said:

íííí""Come on each of you in his turn, going towards the right from theplace at which the. cupbearer begins when he is handing round thewine.""

ííííThe rest agreed, and Leiodes son of OEnops was the first to rise. Hewas sacrificial priest to the suitors, and sat in the corner nearthe mixing-bowl. He was the only man who hated their evil deeds andwas indignant with the others. He was now the first to take the bowand arrow, so he went on to the pavement to make his trial, but hecould not string the bow, for his hands were weak and unused to hardwork, they therefore soon grew tired, and he said to the suitors,""My friends, I cannot string it; let another have it; this bow shalltake the life and soul out of many a chief among us, for it isbetter to die than to live after having missed the prize that wehave so long striven for, and which has brought us so long together.Some one of us is even now hoping and praying that he may marryPenelope, but when he has seen this bow and tried it, let him wooand make bridal offerings to some other woman, and let Penelopemarry whoever makes her the best offer and whose lot it is to winher.""

ííííOn this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door,with the arrow standing against the tip of the bow. Then he took hisseat again on the seat from which he had risen; and Antinous rebukedhim saying:

íííí""Leiodes, what are you talking about? Your words are monstrous andintolerable; it makes me angry to listen to you. Shall, then, this bowtake the life of many a chief among us, merely because you cannot bendit yourself? True, you were not born to be an archer, but there areothers who will soon string it.""

ííííThen he said to Melanthius the goatherd, ""Look sharp, light a firein the court, and set a seat hard by with a sheep skin on it; bring usalso a large ball of lard, from what they have in the house. Let uswarm the bow and grease it we will then make trial of it again, andbring the contest to an end.""

ííííMelanthius lit the fire, and set a seat covered with sheep skinsbeside it. He also brought a great ball of lard from what they hadin the house, and the suitors warmed the bow and again made trial ofit, but they were none of them nearly strong enough to string it.Nevertheless there still remained Antinous and Eurymachus, who werethe ringleaders among the suitors and much the foremost among themall.

ííííThen the swineherd and the stockman left the cloisters together, andUlysses followed them. When they had got outside the gates and theouter yard, Ulysses said to them quietly:

íííí""Stockman, and you swineherd, I have something in my mind which I amin doubt whether to say or no; but I think I will say it. Whatmanner of men would you be to stand by Ulysses, if some god shouldbring him back here all of a sudden? Say which you are disposed to do-to side with the suitors, or with Ulysses?""

íííí""Father Jove,"" answered the stockman, ""would indeed that you mightso ordain it. If some god were but to bring Ulysses back, you shouldsee with what might and main I would fight for him.""

ííííIn like words Eumaeus prayed to all the gods that Ulysses mightreturn; when, therefore, he saw for certain what mind they were of,Ulysses said, ""It is I, Ulysses, who am here. I have suffered much,but at last, in the twentieth year, I am come back to my owncountry. I find that you two alone of all my servants are glad thatI should do so, for I have not heard any of the others praying formy return. To you two, therefore, will I unfold the truth as itshall be. If heaven shall deliver the suitors into my hands, I willfind wives for both of you, will give you house and holding close tomy own, and you shall be to me as though you were brothers and friendsof Telemachus. I will now give you convincing proofs that you may knowme and be assured. See, here is the scar from the boar's tooth thatripped me when I was out hunting on Mount Parnassus with the sons ofAutolycus.""

ííííAs he spoke he drew his rags aside from the great scar, and whenthey had examined it thoroughly, they both of them wept about Ulysses,threw their arms round him and kissed his head and shoulders, whileUlysses kissed their hands and faces in return. The sun would havegone down upon their mourning if Ulysses had not checked them andsaid:

íííí""Cease your weeping, lest some one should come outside and see us,and tell those who a are within. When you go in, do so separately, notboth together; I will go first, and do you follow afterwards; Let thismoreover be the token between us; the suitors will all of them tryto prevent me from getting hold of the bow and quiver; do you,therefore, Eumaeus, place it in my hands when you are carrying itabout, and tell the women to close the doors of their apartment. Ifthey hear any groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house,they must not come out; they must keep quiet, and stay where theyare at their work. And I charge you, Philoetius, to make fast thedoors of the outer court, and to bind them securely at once.""

ííííWhen he had thus spoken, he went back to the house and took the seatthat he had left. Presently, his two servants followed him inside.

ííííAt this moment the bow was in the hands of Eurymachus, who waswarming it by the fire, but even so he could not string it, and he wasgreatly grieved. He heaved a deep sigh and said, ""I grieve formyself and for us all; I grieve that I shall have to forgo themarriage, but I do not care nearly so much about this, for there areplenty of other women in Ithaca and elsewhere; what I feel most is thefact of our being so inferior to Ulysses in strength that we cannotstring his bow. This will disgrace us in the eyes of those who are yetunborn.""

íííí""It shall not be so, Eurymachus,"" said Antinous, ""and you know ityourself. To-day is the feast of Apollo throughout all the land; whocan string a bow on such a day as this? Put it on one side- as for theaxes they can stay where they are, for no one is likely to come to thehouse and take them away: let the cupbearer go round with his cups,that we may make our drink-offerings and drop this matter of thebow; we will tell Melanthius to bring us in some goats to-morrow-the best he has; we can then offer thigh bones to Apollo the mightyarcher, and again make trial of the bow, so as to bring the contest toan end.""

ííííThe rest approved his words, and thereon men servants poured waterover the hands of the guests, while pages filled the mixing-bowls withwine and water and handed it round after giving every man hisdrink-offering. Then, when they had made their offerings and had drunkeach as much as he desired, Ulysses craftily said:

íííí""Suitors of the illustrious queen, listen that I may speak even as Iam minded. I appeal more especially to Eurymachus, and to Antinous whohas just spoken with so much reason. Cease shooting for the presentand leave the matter to the gods, but in the morning let heaven givevictory to whom it will. For the moment, however, give me the bow thatI may prove the power of my hands among you all, and see whether Istill have as much strength as I used to have, or whether travel andneglect have made an end of it.""

ííííThis made them all very angry, for they feared he might string thebow; Antinous therefore rebuked him fiercely saying, ""Wretchedcreature, you have not so much as a grain of sense in your whole body;you ought to think yourself lucky in being allowed to dine unharmedamong your betters, without having any smaller portion served you thanwe others have had, and in being allowed to hear our conversation.No other beggar or stranger has been allowed to hear what we say amongourselves; the wine must have been doing you a mischief, as it doeswith all those drink immoderately. It was wine that inflamed theCentaur Eurytion when he was staying with Peirithous among theLapithae. When the wine had got into his head he went mad and didill deeds about the house of Peirithous; this angered the heroes whowere there assembled, so they rushed at him and cut off his ears andnostrils; then they dragged him through the doorway out of thehouse, so he went away crazed, and bore the burden of his crime,bereft of understanding. Henceforth, therefore, there was warbetween mankind and the centaurs, but he brought it upon himselfthrough his own drunkenness. In like manner I can tell you that itwill go hardly with you if you string the bow: you will find nomercy from any one here, for we shall at once ship you off to kingEchetus, who kills every one that comes near him: you will never getaway alive, so drink and keep quiet without getting into a quarrelwith men younger than yourself.""

ííííPenelope then spoke to him. ""Antinous,"" said she, ""it is not rightthat you should ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes to thishouse. If the stranger should prove strong enough to string the mightybow of Ulysses, can you suppose that he would take me home with himand make me his wife? Even the man himself can have no such idea inhis mind: none of you need let that disturb his feasting; it wouldbe out of all reason.""

íííí""Queen Penelope,"" answered Eurymachus, ""we do not suppose thatthis man will take you away with him; it is impossible; but we areafraid lest some of the baser sort, men or women among the Achaeans,should go gossiping about and say, 'These suitors are a feeble folk;they are paying court to the wife of a brave man whose bow not oneof them was able to string, and yet a beggarly tramp who came to thehouse strung it at once and sent an arrow through the iron.' This iswhat will be said, and it will be a scandal against us.""

íííí""Eurymachus,"" Penelope answered, ""people who persist in eating upthe estate of a great chieftain and dishonouring his house must notexpect others to think well of them. Why then should you mind if mentalk as you think they will? This stranger is strong and well-built,he says moreover that he is of noble birth. Give him the bow, andlet us see whether he can string it or no. I say- and it shallsurely be- that if Apollo vouchsafes him the glory of stringing it,I will give him a cloak and shirt of good wear, with a javelin to keepoff dogs and robbers, and a sharp sword. I will also give him sandals,and will see him sent safely whereever he wants to go.""

ííííThen Telemachus said, ""Mother, I am the only man either in Ithaca orin the islands that are over against Elis who has the right to let anyone have the bow or to refuse it. No one shall force me one way or theother, not even though I choose to make the stranger a present ofthe bow outright, and let him take it away with him. Go, then,within the house and busy yourself with your daily duties, yourloom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants. This bow is aman's matter, and mine above all others, for it is I who am masterhere.""

ííííShe went wondering back into the house, and laid her son's saying inher heart. Then going upstairs with her handmaids into her room, shemourned her dear husband till Minerva sent sweet sleep over hereyelids.

ííííThe swineherd now took up the bow and was for taking it toUlysses, but the suitors clamoured at him from all parts of thecloisters, and one of them said, ""You idiot, where are you takingthe bow to? Are you out of your wits? If Apollo and the other godswill grant our prayer, your own boarhounds shall get you into somequiet little place, and worry you to death.""

ííííEumaeus was frightened at the outcry they all raised, so he putthe bow down then and there, but Telemachus shouted out at him fromthe other side of the cloisters, and threatened him saying, ""FatherEumaeus, bring the bow on in spite of them, or young as I am I willpelt you with stones back to the country, for I am the better man ofthe two. I wish I was as much stronger than all the other suitors inthe house as I am than you, I would soon send some of them off sickand sorry, for they mean mischief.""

ííííThus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily, whichput them in a better humour with Telemachus; so Eumaeus brought thebow on and placed it in the hands of Ulysses. When he had done this,he called Euryclea apart and said to her, ""Euryclea, Telemachus saysyou are to close the doors of the women's apartments. If they hear anygroaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house, they are not tocome out, but are to keep quiet and stay where they are at theirwork.""

ííííEuryclea did as she was told and closed the doors of the women'sapartments.

ííííMeanwhile Philoetius slipped quietly out and made fast the gatesof the outer court. There was a ship's cable of byblus fibre lyingin the gatehouse, so he made the gates fast with it and then came inagain, resuming the seat that he had left, and keeping an eye onUlysses, who had now got the bow in his hands, and was turning itevery way about, and proving it all over to see whether the wormshad been eating into its two horns during his absence. Then wouldone turn towards his neighbour saying, ""This is some tricky oldbow-fancier; either he has got one like it at home, or he wants tomake one, in such workmanlike style does the old vagabond handle it.""

ííííAnother said, ""I hope he may be no more successful in other thingsthan he is likely to be in stringing this bow.""

ííííBut Ulysses, when he had taken it up and examined it all over,strung it as easily as a skilled bard strings a new peg of his lyreand makes the twisted gut fast at both ends. Then he took it in hisright hand to prove the string, and it sang sweetly under his touchlike the twittering of a swallow. The suitors were dismayed, andturned colour as they heard it; at that moment, moreover, Jovethundered loudly as a sign, and the heart of Ulysses rejoiced as heheard the omen that the son of scheming Saturn had sent him.

ííííHe took an arrow that was lying upon the table- for those whichthe Achaeans were so shortly about to taste were all inside thequiver- he laid it on the centre-piece of the bow, and drew thenotch of the arrow and the string toward him, still seated on hisseat. When he had taken aim he let fly, and his arrow pierced everyone of the handle-holes of the axes from the first onwards till it hadgone right through them, and into the outer courtyard. Then he said toTelemachus:

íííí""Your guest has not disgraced you, Telemachus. I did not miss what Iaimed at, and I was not long in stringing my bow. I am still strong,and not as the suitors twit me with being. Now, however, it is timefor the Achaeans to prepare supper while there is still daylight,and then otherwise to disport themselves with song and dance which arethe crowning ornaments of a banquet.""

ííííAs he spoke he made a sign with his eyebrows, and Telemachusgirded on his sword, grasped his spear, and stood armed beside hisfather's seat.

ííííBOOK XXII.

ííííTHEN Ulysses tore off his rags, and sprang on to the broadpavement with his bow and his quiver full of arrows. He shed thearrows on to the ground at his feet and said, ""The mighty contest isat an end. I will now see whether Apollo will vouchsafe it to me tohit another mark which no man has yet hit.""

ííííOn this he aimed a deadly arrow at Antinous, who was about to takeup a two-handled gold cup to drink his wine and already had it inhis hands. He had no thought of death- who amongst all the revellerswould think that one man, however brave, would stand alone among somany and kill him? The arrow struck Antinous in the throat, and thepoint went clean through his neck, so that he fell over and the cupdropped from his hand, while a thick stream of blood gushed from hisnostrils. He kicked the table from him and upset the things on it,so that the bread and roasted meats were all soiled as they fellover on to the ground. The suitors were in an uproar when they sawthat a man had been hit; they sprang in dismay one and all of themfrom their seats and looked everywhere towards the walls, but therewas neither shield nor spear, and they rebuked Ulysses very angrily.""Stranger,"" said they, ""you shall pay for shooting people in this way:om yi you shall see no other contest; you are a doomed man; he whomyou have slain was the foremost youth in Ithaca, and the vulturesshall devour you for having killed him.""

ííííThus they spoke, for they thought that he had killed Antinous bymistake, and did not perceive that death was hanging over the headof every one of them. But Ulysses glared at them and said:

íííí""Dogs, did you think that I should not come back from Troy? You havewasted my substance, have forced my women servants to lie with you,and have wooed my wife while I was still living. You have fearedneither Cod nor man, and now you shall die.""

ííííThey turned pale with fear as he spoke, and every man looked roundabout to see whither he might fly for safety, but Eurymachus alonespoke.

íííí""If you are Ulysses,"" said he, ""then what you have said is just.We have done much wrong on your lands and in your house. ButAntinous who was the head and front of the offending lies low already.It was all his doing. It was not that he wanted to marry Penelope;he did not so much care about that; what he wanted was something quitedifferent, and Jove has not vouchsafed it to him; he wanted to killyour son and to be chief man in Ithaca. Now, therefore, that he hasmet the death which was his due, spare the lives of your people. Wewill make everything good among ourselves, and pay you in full for allthat we have eaten and drunk. Each one of us shall pay you a fineworth twenty oxen, and we will keep on giving you gold and bronze tillyour heart is softened. Until we have done this no one can complain ofyour being enraged against us.""

ííííUlysses again glared at him and said, ""Though you should give me allthat you have in the world both now and all that you ever shallhave, I will not stay my hand till I have paid all of you in full. Youmust fight, or fly for your lives; and fly, not a man of you shall.""

ííííTheir hearts sank as they heard him, but Eurymachus again spokesaying:

íííí""My friends, this man will give us no quarter. He will stand wherehe is and shoot us down till he has killed every man among us. Letus then show fight; draw your swords, and hold up the tables to shieldyou from his arrows. Let us have at him with a rush, to drive him fromthe pavement and doorway: we can then get through into the town, andraise such an alarm as shall soon stay his shooting.""

ííííAs he spoke he drew his keen blade of bronze, sharpened on bothsides, and with a loud cry sprang towards Ulysses, but Ulyssesinstantly shot an arrow into his breast that caught him by thenipple and fixed itself in his liver. He dropped his sword and felldoubled up over his table. The cup and all the meats went over on tothe ground as he smote the earth with his forehead in the agonies ofdeath, and he kicked the stool with his feet until his eyes wereclosed in darkness.

ííííThen Amphinomus drew his sword and made straight at Ulysses to tryand get him away from the door; but Telemachus was too quick forhim, and struck him from behind; the spear caught him between theshoulders and went right through his chest, so that he fell heavily tothe ground and struck the earth with his forehead. Then Telemachussprang away from him, leaving his spear still in the body, for hefeared that if he stayed to draw it out, some one of the Achaeansmight come up and hack at him with his sword, or knock him down, so heset off at a run, and immediately was at his father's side. Then hesaid:

íííí""Father, let me bring you a shield, two spears, and a brass helmetfor your temples. I will arm myself as well, and will bring otherarmour for the swineherd and the stockman, for we had better bearmed.""

íííí""Run and fetch them,"" answered Ulysses, ""while my arrows hold out,or when I am alone they may get me away from the door.""

ííííTelemachus did as his father said, and went off to the store roomwhere the armour was kept. He chose four shields, eight spears, andfour brass helmets with horse-hair plumes. He brought them with allspeed to his father, and armed himself first, while the stockman andthe swineherd also put on their armour, and took their places nearUlysses. Meanwhile Ulysses, as long as his arrows lasted, had beenshooting the suitors one by one, and they fell thick on one another:when his arrows gave out, he set the bow to stand against the end wallof the house by the door post, and hung a shield four hides thickabout his shoulders; on his comely head he set his helmet, wellwrought with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it,and he grasped two redoubtable bronze-shod spears.

ííííNow there was a trap door on the wall, while at one end of thepavement there was an exit leading to a narrow passage, and thisexit was closed by a well-made door. Ulysses told Philoetius tostand by this door and guard it, for only one person could attack itat a time. But Agelaus shouted out, ""Cannot some one go up to the trapdoor and tell the people what is going on? Help would come at once,and we should soon make an end of this man and his shooting.""

íííí""This may not be, Agelaus,"" answered Melanthius, ""the mouth of thenarrow passage is dangerously near the entrance to the outer court.One brave man could prevent any number from getting in. But I knowwhat I will do, I will bring you arms from the store room, for I amsure it is there that Ulysses and his son have put them.""

ííííOn this the goatherd Melanthius went by back passages to the storeroom of Ulysses, house. There he chose twelve shields, with as manyhelmets and spears, and brought them back as fast as he could togive them to the suitors. Ulysses' heart began to fail him when he sawthe suitors putting on their armour and brandishing their spears. Hesaw the greatness of the danger, and said to Telemachus, ""Some oneof the women inside is helping the suitors against us, or it may beMelanthius.""

ííííTelemachus answered, ""The fault, father, is mine, and mine only; Ileft the store room door open, and they have kept a sharper look outthan I have. Go, Eumaeus, put the door to, and see whether it is oneof the women who is doing this, or whether, as I suspect, it isMelanthius the son of Dolius.""

ííííThus did they converse. Meanwhile Melanthius was again going tothe store room to fetch more armour, but the swineherd saw him andsaid to Ulysses who was beside him, ""Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, itis that scoundrel Melanthius, just as we suspected, who is going tothe store room. Say, shall I kill him, if I can get the better of him,or shall I bring him here that you may take your own revenge for allthe many wrongs that he has done in your house?""

ííííUlysses answered, ""Telemachus and I will hold these suitors incheck, no matter what they do; go back both of you and bindMelanthius' hands and feet behind him. Throw him into the store roomand make the door fast behind you; then fasten a noose about his body,and string him close up to the rafters from a high bearing-post,that he may linger on in an agony.""

ííííThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said; they went tothe store room, which they entered before Melanthius saw them, forhe was busy searching for arms in the innermost part of the room, sothe two took their stand on either side of the door and waited. By andby Melanthius came out with a helmet in one hand, and an olddry-rotted shield in the other, which had been borne by Laertes whenhe was young, but which had been long since thrown aside, and thestraps had become unsewn; on this the two seized him, dragged him backby the hair, and threw him struggling to the ground. They bent hishands and feet well behind his back, and bound them tight with apainful bond as Ulysses had told them; then they fastened a nooseabout his body and strung him up from a high pillar till he wasclose up to the rafters, and over him did you then vaunt, Oswineherd Eumaeus, saying, ""Melanthius, you will pass the night on asoft bed as you deserve. You will know very well when morning comesfrom the streams of Oceanus, and it is time for you to be driving inyour goats for the suitors to feast on.""

ííííThere, then, they left him in very cruel bondage, and having puton their armour they closed the door behind them and went back to taketheir places by the side of Ulysses; whereon the four men stood in thecloister, fierce and full of fury; nevertheless, those who were in thebody of the court were still both brave and many. Then Jove's daughterMinerva came up to them, having assumed the voice and form ofMentor. Ulysses was glad when he saw her and said, ""Mentor, lend meyour help, and forget not your old comrade, nor the many good turns hehas done you. Besides, you are my age-mate.""

ííííBut all the time he felt sure it was Minerva, and the suitors fromthe other side raised an uproar when they saw her. Agelaus was thefirst to reproach her. ""Mentor,"" he cried, ""do not let Ulysses beguileyou into siding with him and fighting the suitors. This is what wewill do: when we have killed these people, father and son, we willkill you too. You shall pay for it with your head, and when we havekilled you, we will take all you have, in doors or out, and bring itinto hotch-pot with Ulysses' property; we will not let your sonslive in your house, nor your daughters, nor shall your widowcontinue to live in the city of Ithaca.""

ííííThis made Minerva still more furious, so she scolded Ulysses veryangrily. ""Ulysses,"" said she, ""your strength and prowess are no longerwhat they were when you fought for nine long years among the Trojansabout the noble lady Helen. You killed many a man in those days, andit was through your stratagem that Priam's city was taken. How comesit that you are so lamentably less valiant now that you are on yourown ground, face to face with the suitors in your own house? Comeon, my good fellow, stand by my side and see how Mentor, son ofAlcinous shall fight your foes and requite your kindnesses conferredupon him.""

ííííBut she would not give him full victory as yet, for she wished stillfurther to prove his own prowess and that of his brave son, so sheflew up to one of the rafters in the roof of the cloister and sat uponit in the form of a swallow.

ííííMeanwhile Agelaus son of Damastor, Eurynomus, Amphimedon,Demoptolemus, Pisander, and Polybus son of Polyctor bore the bruntof the fight upon the suitors' side; of all those who were stillfighting for their lives they were by far the most valiant, for theothers had already fallen under the arrows of Ulysses. Agelaus shoutedto them and said, ""My friends, he will soon have to leave off, forMentor has gone away after having done nothing for him but brag.They are standing at the doors unsupported. Do not aim at him all atonce, but six of you throw your spears first, and see if you cannotcover yourselves with glory by killing him. When he has fallen we neednot be uneasy about the others.""

ííííThey threw their spears as he bade them, but Minerva made them allof no effect. One hit the door post; another went against the door;the pointed shaft of another struck the wall; and as soon as theyhad avoided all the spears of the suitors Ulysses said to his own men,""My friends, I should say we too had better let drive into themiddle of them, or they will crown all the harm they have done us byus outright.""

ííííThey therefore aimed straight in front of them and threw theirspears. Ulysses killed Demoptolemus, Telemachus Euryades, EumaeusElatus, while the stockman killed Pisander. These all bit the dust,and as the others drew back into a corner Ulysses and his men rushedforward and regained their spears by drawing them from the bodies ofthe dead.

ííííThe suitors now aimed a second time, but again Minerva made theirweapons for the most part without effect. One hit a bearing-post ofthe cloister; another went against the door; while the pointed shaftof another struck the wall. Still, Amphimedon just took a piece of thetop skin from off Telemachus's wrist, and Ctesippus managed to grazeEumaeus's shoulder above his shield; but the spear went on and fell tothe ground. Then Ulysses and his men let drive into the crowd ofsuitors. Ulysses hit Eurydamas, Telemachus Amphimedon, and EumaeusPolybus. After this the stockman hit Ctesippus in the breast, andtaunted him saying, ""Foul-mouthed son of Polytherses, do not be sofoolish as to talk wickedly another time, but let heaven direct yourspeech, for the gods are far stronger than men. I make you a presentof this advice to repay you for the foot which you gave Ulysses whenhe was begging about in his own house.""

ííííThus spoke the stockman, and Ulysses struck the son of Damastor witha spear in close fight, while Telemachus hit Leocritus son of Evenorin the belly, and the dart went clean through him, so that he fellforward full on his face upon the ground. Then Minerva from her seaton the rafter held up her deadly aegis, and the hearts of thesuitors quailed. They fled to the other end of the court like a herdof cattle maddened by the gadfly in early summer when the days areat their longest. As eagle-beaked, crook-taloned vultures from themountains swoop down on the smaller birds that cower in flocks uponthe ground, and kill them, for they cannot either fight or fly, andlookers on enjoy the sport- even so did Ulysses and his men fallupon the suitors and smite them on every side. They made a horriblegroaning as their brains were being battered in, and the groundseethed with their blood.

ííííLeiodes then caught the knees of Ulysses and said, ""Ulysses Ibeseech you have mercy upon me and spare me. I never wronged any ofthe women in your house either in word or deed, and I tried to stopthe others. I saw them, but they would not listen, and now they arepaying for their folly. I was their sacrificing priest; if you killme, I shall die without having done anything to deserve it, andshall have got no thanks for all the good that I did.""

ííííUlysses looked sternly at him and answered, ""If you were theirsacrificing priest, you must have prayed many a time that it mightbe long before I got home again, and that you might marry my wifeand have children by her. Therefore you shall die.""

ííííWith these words he picked up the sword that Agelaus had droppedwhen he was being killed, and which was lying upon the ground. Then hestruck Leiodes on the back of his neck, so that his head fellrolling in the dust while he was yet speaking.

ííííThe minstrel Phemius son of Terpes- he who had been forced by thesuitors to sing to them- now tried to save his life. He was standingnear towards the trap door, and held his lyre in his hand. He didnot know whether to fly out of the cloister and sit down by thealtar of Jove that was in the outer court, and on which both Laertesand Ulysses had offered up the thigh bones of many an ox, or whetherto go straight up to Ulysses and embrace his knees, but in the endhe deemed it best to embrace Ulysses' knees. So he laid his lyre onthe ground the ground between the mixing-bowl and the silver-studdedseat; then going up to Ulysses he caught hold of his knees and said,""Ulysses, I beseech you have mercy on me and spare me. You will besorry for it afterwards if you kill a bard who can sing both forgods and men as I can. I make all my lays myself, and heaven visits mewith every kind of inspiration. I would sing to you as though you werea god, do not therefore be in such a hurry to cut my head off. Yourown son Telemachus will tell you that I did not want to frequentyour house and sing to the suitors after their meals, but they weretoo many and too strong for me, so they made me.""

ííííTelemachus heard him, and at once went up to his father. ""Hold!""he cried, ""the man is guiltless, do him no hurt; and we will Medontoo, who was always good to me when I was a boy, unless Philoetiusor Eumaeus has already killed him, or he has fallen in your way whenyou were raging about the court.""

ííííMedon caught these words of Telemachus, for he was crouching under aseat beneath which he had hidden by covering himself up with a freshlyflayed heifer's hide, so he threw off the hide, went up to Telemachus,and laid hold of his knees.

íííí""Here I am, my dear sir,"" said he, ""stay your hand therefore, andtell your father, or he will kill me in his rage against the suitorsfor having wasted his substance and been so foolishly disrespectful toyourself.""

ííííUlysses smiled at him and answered, ""Fear not; Telemachus hassaved your life, that you may know in future, and tell other people,how greatly better good deeds prosper than evil ones. Go, therefore,outside the cloisters into the outer court, and be out of the way ofthe slaughter- you and the bard- while I finish my work here inside.""

ííííThe pair went into the outer court as fast as they could, and satdown by Jove's great altar, looking fearfully round, and stillexpecting that they would be killed. Then Ulysses searched the wholecourt carefully over, to see if anyone had managed to hide himself andwas still living, but he found them all lying in the dust andweltering in their blood. They were like fishes which fishermen havenetted out of the sea, and thrown upon the beach to lie gasping forwater till the heat of the sun makes an end of them. Even so werethe suitors lying all huddled up one against the other.

ííííThen Ulysses said to Telemachus, ""Call nurse Euryclea; I havesomething to say to her.""

ííííTelemachus went and knocked at the door of the women's room. ""Makehaste,"" said he, ""you old woman who have been set over all the otherwomen in the house. Come outside; my father wishes to speak to you.""

ííííWhen Euryclea heard this she unfastened the door of the women's roomand came out, following Telemachus. She found Ulysses among thecorpses bespattered with blood and filth like a lion that has justbeen devouring an ox, and his breast and both his cheeks are allbloody, so that he is a fearful sight; even so was Ulyssesbesmirched from head to foot with gore. When she saw all the corpsesand such a quantity of blood, she was beginning to cry out for joy,for she saw that a great deed had been done; but Ulysses checkedher, ""Old woman,"" said he, ""rejoice in silence; restrain yourself, anddo not make any noise about it; it is an unholy thing to vaunt overdead men. Heaven's doom and their own evil deeds have brought thesemen to destruction, for they respected no man in the whole world,neither rich nor poor, who came near them, and they have come to a badend as a punishment for their wickedness and folly. Now, however, tellme which of the women in the house have misconducted themselves, andwho are innocent.""

íííí""I will tell you the truth, my son,"" answered Euryclea. ""There arefifty women in the house whom we teach to do things, such as cardingwool, and all kinds of household work. Of these, twelve in all havemisbehaved, and have been wanting in respect to me, and also toPenelope. They showed no disrespect to Telemachus, for he has onlylately grown and his mother never permitted him to give orders tothe female servants; but let me go upstairs and tell your wife allthat has happened, for some god has been sending her to sleep.""

íííí""Do not wake her yet,"" answered Ulysses, ""but tell the women whohave misconducted themselves to come to me.""

ííííEuryclea left the cloister to tell the women, and make them cometo Ulysses; in the meantime he called Telemachus, the stockman, andthe swineherd. ""Begin,"" said he, ""to remove the dead, and make thewomen help you. Then, get sponges and clean water to swill down thetables and seats. When you have thoroughly cleansed the wholecloisters, take the women into the space between the domed room andthe wall of the outer court, and run them through with your swordstill they are quite dead, and have forgotten all about love and theway in which they used to lie in secret with the suitors.""

ííííOn this the women came down in a body, weeping and wailing bitterly.First they carried the dead bodies out, and propped them up againstone another in the gatehouse. Ulysses ordered them about and made themdo their work quickly, so they had to carry the bodies out. Whenthey had done this, they cleaned all the tables and seats with spongesand water, while Telemachus and the two others shovelled up theblood and dirt from the ground, and the women carried it all awayand put it out of doors. Then when they had made the whole place quiteclean and orderly, they took the women out and hemmed them in thenarrow space between the wall of the domed room and that of theyard, so that they could not get away: and Telemachus said to theother two, ""I shall not let these women die a clean death, for theywere insolent to me and my mother, and used to sleep with thesuitors.""

ííííSo saying he made a ship's cable fast to one of the bearing-poststhat supported the roof of the domed room, and secured it all aroundthe building, at a good height, lest any of the women's feet shouldtouch the ground; and as thrushes or doves beat against a net that hasbeen set for them in a thicket just as they were getting to theirnest, and a terrible fate awaits them, even so did the women have toput their heads in nooses one after the other and die mostmiserably. Their feet moved convulsively for a while, but not for verylong.

ííííAs for Melanthius, they took him through the cloister into the innercourt. There they cut off his nose and his ears; they drew out hisvitals and gave them to the dogs raw, and then in their fury theycut off his hands and his feet.

ííííWhen they had done this they washed their hands and feet and wentback into the house, for all was now over; and Ulysses said to thedear old nurse Euryclea, ""Bring me sulphur, which cleanses allpollution, and fetch fire also that I may burn it, and purify thecloisters. Go, moreover, and tell Penelope to come here with herattendants, and also all the maid servants that are in the house.""

íííí""All that you have said is true,"" answered Euryclea, ""but let mebring you some clean clothes- a shirt and cloak. Do not keep theserags on your back any longer. It is not right.""

íííí""First light me a fire,"" replied Ulysses.

ííííShe brought the fire and sulphur, as he had bidden her, andUlysses thoroughly purified the cloisters and both the inner and outercourts. Then she went inside to call the women and tell them whathad happened; whereon they came from their apartment with torches intheir hands, and pressed round Ulysses to embrace him, kissing hishead and shoulders and taking hold of his hands. It made him feel asif he should like to weep, for he remembered every one of them.

ííííBOOK XXIII.

ííííEURYCLEA now went upstairs laughing to tell her mistress that herdear husband had come home. Her aged knees became young again andher feet were nimble for joy as she went up to her mistress and bentover her head to speak to her. ""Wake up Penelope, my dear child,""she exclaimed, ""and see with your own eyes something that you havebeen wanting this long time past. Ulysses has at last indeed come homeagain, and has killed the suitors who were giving so much trouble inhis house, eating up his estate and ill-treating his son.""

íííí""My good nurse,"" answered Penelope, ""you must be mad. The godssometimes send some very sensible people out of their minds, andmake foolish people become sensible. This is what they must havebeen doing to you; for you always used to be a reasonable person.Why should you thus mock me when I have trouble enough already-talking such nonsense, and waking me up out of a sweet sleep thathad taken possession of my eyes and closed them? I have never slept sosoundly from the day my poor husband went to that city with theill-omened name. Go back again into the women's room; if it had beenany one else, who had woke me up to bring me such absurd news I shouldhave sent her away with a severe scolding. As it is, your age shallprotect you.""

íííí""My dear child,"" answered Euryclea, ""I am not mocking you. It isquite true as I tell you that Ulysses is come home again. He was thestranger whom they all kept on treating so badly in the cloister.Telemachus knew all the time that he was come back, but kept hisfather's secret that he might have his revenge on all these wickedpeople.

ííííThen Penelope sprang up from her couch, threw her arms roundEuryclea, and wept for joy. ""But my dear nurse,"" said she, ""explainthis to me; if he has really come home as you say, how did he manageto overcome the wicked suitors single handed, seeing what a numberof them there always were?""

íííí""I was not there,"" answered Euryclea, ""and do not know; I only heardthem groaning while they were being killed. We sat crouching andhuddled up in a corner of the women's room with the doors closed, tillyour son came to fetch me because his father sent him. Then I foundUlysses standing over the corpses that were lying on the ground allround him, one on top of the other. You would have enjoyed it if youcould have seen him standing there all bespattered with blood andfilth, and looking just like a lion. But the corpses are now all piledup in the gatehouse that is in the outer court, and Ulysses has lita great fire to purify the house with sulphur. He has sent me tocall you, so come with me that you may both be happy together afterall; for now at last the desire of your heart has been fulfilled; yourhusband is come home to find both wife and son alive and well, andto take his revenge in his own house on the suitors who behaved sobadly to him.""

íííí""'My dear nurse,"" said Penelope, ""do not exult too confidentlyover all this. You know how delighted every one would be to seeUlysses come home- more particularly myself, and the son who hasbeen born to both of us; but what you tell me cannot be really true.It is some god who is angry with the suitors for their greatwickedness, and has made an end of them; for they respected no manin the whole world, neither rich nor poor, who came near them, whocame near them, and they have come to a bad end in consequence oftheir iniquity. Ulysses is dead far away from the Achaean land; hewill never return home again.""

ííííThen nurse Euryclea said, ""My child, what are you talking about? butyou were all hard of belief and have made up your mind that yourhusband is never coming, although he is in the house and by his ownfire side at this very moment. Besides I can give you another proof;when I was washing him I perceived the scar which the wild boar gavehim, and I wanted to tell you about it, but in his wisdom he would notlet me, and clapped his hands over my mouth; so come with me and Iwill make this bargain with you- if I am deceiving you, you may haveme killed by the most cruel death you can think of.""

íííí""My dear nurse,"" said Penelope, ""however wise you may be you canhardly fathom the counsels of the gods. Nevertheless, we will go insearch of my son, that I may see the corpses of the suitors, and theman who has killed them.""

ííííOn this she came down from her upper room, and while doing so sheconsidered whether she should keep at a distance from her husbandand question him, or whether she should at once go up to him andembrace him. When, however, she had crossed the stone floor of thecloister, she sat down opposite Ulysses by the fire, against thewall at right angles [to that by which she had entered], while Ulyssessat near one of the bearing-posts, looking upon the ground, andwaiting to see what his wife would say to him when she saw him. Fora long time she sat silent and as one lost in amazement. At one momentshe looked him full in the face, but then again directly, she wasmisled by his shabby clothes and failed to recognize him, tillTelemachus began to reproach her and said:

íííí""Mother- but you are so hard that I cannot call you by such aname- why do you keep away from my father in this way? Why do younot sit by his side and begin talking to him and asking him questions?No other woman could bear to keep away from her husband when he hadcome back to her after twenty years of absence, and after havinggone through so much; but your heart always was as hard as a stone.""

ííííPenelope answered, ""My son, I am so lost in astonishment that Ican find no words in which either to ask questions or to answerthem. I cannot even look him straight in the face. Still, if he reallyis Ulysses come back to his own home again, we shall get to understandone another better by and by, for there are tokens with which we twoare alone acquainted, and which are hidden from all others.""

ííííUlysses smiled at this, and said to Telemachus, ""Let your mother putme to any proof she likes; she will make up her mind about itpresently. She rejects me for the moment and believes me to besomebody else, because I am covered with dirt and have such badclothes on; let us, however, consider what we had better do next. Whenone man has killed another, even though he was not one who would leavemany friends to take up his quarrel, the man who has killed him muststill say good bye to his friends and fly the country; whereas we havebeen killing the stay of a whole town, and all the picked youth ofIthaca. I would have you consider this matter.""

íííí""Look to it yourself, father,"" answered Telemachus, ""for they sayyou are the wisest counsellor in the world, and that there is no othermortal man who can compare with you. We will follow you with rightgood will, nor shall you find us fail you in so far as our strengthholds out.""

íííí""I will say what I think will be best,"" answered Ulysses. ""Firstwash and put your shirts on; tell the maids also to go to their ownroom and dress; Phemius shall then strike up a dance tune on his lyre,so that if people outside hear, or any of the neighbours, or someone going along the street happens to notice it, they may thinkthere is a wedding in the house, and no rumours about the death of thesuitors will get about in the town, before we can escape to thewoods upon my own land. Once there, we will settle which of thecourses heaven vouchsafes us shall seem wisest.""

ííííThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. First theywashed and put their shirts on, while the women got ready. ThenPhemius took his lyre and set them all longing for sweet song andstately dance. The house re-echoed with the sound of men and womendancing, and the people outside said, ""I suppose the queen has beengetting married at last. She ought to be ashamed of herself for notcontinuing to protect her husband's property until he comes home.""

ííííThis was what they said, but they did not know what it was thathad been happening. The upper servant Eurynome washed and anointedUlysses in his own house and gave him a shirt and cloak, while Minervamade him look taller and stronger than before; she also made thehair grow thick on the top of his head, and flow down in curls likehyacinth blossoms; she glorified him about the head and shoulders justas a skilful workman who has studied art of all kinds under Vulcanor Minerva- and his work is full of beauty- enriches a piece of silverplate by gilding it. He came from the bath looking like one of theimmortals, and sat down opposite his wife on the seat he had left. ""Mydear,"" said he, ""heaven has endowed you with a heart more unyieldingthan woman ever yet had. No other woman could bear to keep away fromher husband when he had come back to her after twenty years ofabsence, and after having gone through so much. But come, nurse, get abed ready for me; I will sleep alone, for this woman has a heart ashard as iron.""

íííí""My dear,"" answered Penelope, ""I have no wish to set myself up,nor to depreciate you; but I am not struck by your appearance, for Ivery well remember what kind of a man you were when you set sailfrom Ithaca. Nevertheless, Euryclea, take his bed outside the bedchamber that he himself built. Bring the bed outside this room, andput bedding upon it with fleeces, good coverlets, and blankets.""

ííííShe said this to try him, but Ulysses was very angry and said,""Wife, I am much displeased at what you have just been saying. Who hasbeen taking my bed from the place in which I left it? He must havefound it a hard task, no matter how skilled a workman he was, unlesssome god came and helped him to shift it. There is no man living,however strong and in his prime, who could move it from its place, forit is a marvellous curiosity which I made with my very own hands.There was a young olive growing within the precincts of the house,in full vigour, and about as thick as a bearing-post. I built myroom round this with strong walls of stone and a roof to cover them,and I made the doors strong and well-fitting. Then I cut off the topboughs of the olive tree and left the stump standing. This I dressedroughly from the root upwards and then worked with carpenter's toolswell and skilfully, straightening my work by drawing a line on thewood, and making it into a bed-prop. I then bored a hole down themiddle, and made it the centre-post of my bed, at which I workedtill I had finished it, inlaying it with gold and silver; after this Istretched a hide of crimson leather from one side of it to theother. So you see I know all about it, and I desire to learn whetherit is still there, or whether any one has been removing it bycutting down the olive tree at its roots.""

ííííWhen she heard the sure proofs Ulysses now gave her, she fairlybroke down. She flew weeping to his side, flung her arms about hisneck, and kissed him. ""Do not be angry with me Ulysses,"" she cried,""you, who are the wisest of mankind. We have suffered, both of us.Heaven has denied us the happiness of spending our youth, and ofgrowing old, together; do not then be aggrieved or take it amissthat I did not embrace you thus as soon as I saw you. I have beenshuddering all the time through fear that someone might come hereand deceive me with a lying story; for there are many very wickedpeople going about. Jove's daughter Helen would never have yieldedherself to a man from a foreign country, if she had known that thesons of Achaeans would come after her and bring her back. Heaven putit in her heart to do wrong, and she gave no thought to that sin,which has been the source of all our sorrows. Now, however, that youhave convinced me by showing that you know all about our bed (which nohuman being has ever seen but you and I and a single maid servant, thedaughter of Actor, who was given me by my father on my marriage, andwho keeps the doors of our room) hard of belief though I have been Ican mistrust no longer.""

ííííThen Ulysses in his turn melted, and wept as he clasped his dear andfaithful wife to his bosom. As the sight of land is welcome to men whoare swimming towards the shore, when Neptune has wrecked their shipwith the fury of his winds and waves- a few alone reach the land,and these, covered with brine, are thankful when they findthemselves on firm ground and out of danger- even so was her husbandwelcome to her as she looked upon him, and she could not tear hertwo fair arms from about his neck. Indeed they would have gone onindulging their sorrow till rosy-fingered morn appeared, had notMinerva determined otherwise, and held night back in the far west,while she would not suffer Dawn to leave Oceanus, nor to yoke thetwo steeds Lampus and Phaethon that bear her onward to break the dayupon mankind.

ííííAt last, however, Ulysses said, ""Wife, we have not yet reached theend of our troubles. I have an unknown amount of toil still toundergo. It is long and difficult, but I must go through with it,for thus the shade of Teiresias prophesied concerning me, on the daywhen I went down into Hades to ask about my return and that of mycompanions. But now let us go to bed, that we may lie down and enjoythe blessed boon of sleep.""

íííí""You shall go to bed as soon as you please,"" replied Penelope,""now that the gods have sent you home to your own good house and toyour country. But as heaven has put it in your mind to speak of it,tell me about the task that lies before you. I shall have to hearabout it later, so it is better that I should be told at once.""

íííí""My dear,"" answered Ulysses, ""why should you press me to tell you?Still, I will not conceal it from you, though you will not like BOOKit. I do not like it myself, for Teiresias bade me travel far andwide, carrying an oar, till I came to a country where the peoplehave never heard of the sea, and do not even mix salt with their food.They know nothing about ships, nor oars that are as the wings of aship. He gave me this certain token which I will not hide from you. Hesaid that a wayfarer should meet me and ask me whether it was awinnowing shovel that I had on my shoulder. On this, I was to fix myoar in the ground and sacrifice a ram, a bull, and a boar toNeptune; after which I was to go home and offer hecatombs to all thegods in heaven, one after the other. As for myself, he said that deathshould come to me from the sea, and that my life should ebb awayvery gently when I was full of years and peace of mind, and mypeople should bless me. All this, he said, should surely come topass.""

ííííAnd Penelope said, ""If the gods are going to vouchsafe you a happiertime in your old age, you may hope then to have some respite frommisfortune.""

ííííThus did they converse. Meanwhile Eurynome and the nurse tooktorches and made the bed ready with soft coverlets; as soon as theyhad laid them, the nurse went back into the house to go to her rest,leaving the bed chamber woman Eurynome to show Ulysses and Penelope tobed by torch light. When she had conducted them to their room she wentback, and they then came joyfully to the rites of their own old bed.Telemachus, Philoetius, and the swineherd now left off dancing, andmade the women leave off also. They then laid themselves down to sleepin the cloisters.

ííííWhen Ulysses and Penelope had had their fill of love they felltalking with one another. She told him how much she had had to bear inseeing the house filled with a crowd of wicked suitors who hadkilled so many sheep and oxen on her account, and had drunk so manycasks of wine. Ulysses in his turn told her what he had suffered,and how much trouble he had himself given to other people. He told hereverything, and she was so delighted to listen that she never wentto sleep till he had ended his whole story.

ííííHe began with his victory over the Cicons, and how he thence reachedthe fertile land of the Lotus-eaters. He told her all about theCyclops and how he had punished him for having so ruthlessly eaten hisbrave comrades; how he then went on to Aeolus, who received himhospitably and furthered him on his way, but even so he was not toreach home, for to his great grief a hurricane carried him out tosea again; how he went on to the Laestrygonian city Telepylos, wherethe people destroyed all his ships with their crews, save himselfand his own ship only. Then he told of cunning Circe and her craft,and how he sailed to the chill house of Hades, to consult the ghost ofthe Theban prophet Teiresias, and how he saw his old comrades in arms,and his mother who bore him and brought him up when he was a child;how he then heard the wondrous singing of the Sirens, and went on tothe wandering rocks and terrible Charybdis and to Scylla, whom noman had ever yet passed in safety; how his men then ate the cattleof the sun-god, and how Jove therefore struck the ship with histhunderbolts, so that all his men perished together, himself alonebeing left alive; how at last he reached the Ogygian island and thenymph Calypso, who kept him there in a cave, and fed him, and wantedhim to marry her, in which case she intended making him immortal sothat he should never grow old, but she could not persuade him to lether do so; and how after much suffering he had found his way to thePhaeacians, who had treated him as though he had been a god, andsent him back in a ship to his own country after having given himgold, bronze, and raiment in great abundance. This was the lastthing about which he told her, for here a deep sleep took hold uponhim and eased the burden of his sorrows.

ííííThen Minerva bethought her of another matter. When she deemed thatUlysses had had both of his wife and of repose, she badegold-enthroned Dawn rise out of Oceanus that she might shed light uponmankind. On this, Ulysses rose from his comfortable bed and said toPenelope, ""Wife, we have both of us had our full share of troubles,you, here, in lamenting my absence, and I in being prevented fromgetting home though I was longing all the time to do so. Now, however,that we have at last come together, take care of the property thatis in the house. As for the sheep and goats which the wicked suitorshave eaten, I will take many myself by force from other people, andwill compel the Achaeans to make good the rest till they shall havefilled all my yards. I am now going to the wooded lands out in thecountry to see my father who has so long been grieved on my account,and to yourself I will give these instructions, though you have littleneed of them. At sunrise it will at once get abroad that I have beenkilling the suitors; go upstairs, therefore, and stay there withyour women. See nobody and ask no questions.""

ííííAs he spoke he girded on his armour. Then he roused Telemachus,Philoetius, and Eumaeus, and told them all to put on their armouralso. This they did, and armed themselves. When they had done so, theyopened the gates and sallied forth, Ulysses leading the way. It wasnow daylight, but Minerva nevertheless concealed them in darknessand led them quickly out of the town.

ííííBOOK XXIV.

ííííTHEN Mercury of Cyllene summoned the ghosts of the suitors, and inhis hand he held the fair golden wand with which he seals men's eyesin sleep or wakes them just as he pleases; with this he roused theghosts and led them, while they followed whining and gibberingbehind him. As bats fly squealing in the hollow of some great cave,when one of them has fallen out of the cluster in which they hang,even so did the ghosts whine and squeal as Mercury the healer ofsorrow led them down into the dark abode of death. When they hadpassed the waters of Oceanus and the rock Leucas, they came to thegates of the sun and the land of dreams, whereon they reached themeadow of asphodel where dwell the souls and shadows of them thatcan labour no more.

ííííHere they found the ghost of Achilles son of Peleus, with those ofPatroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax, who was the finest and handsomest manof all the Danaans after the son of Peleus himself.

ííííThey gathered round the ghost of the son of Peleus, and the ghost ofAgamemnon joined them, sorrowing bitterly. Round him were gatheredalso the ghosts of those who had perished with him in the house ofAeisthus; and the ghost of Achilles spoke first.

íííí""Son of Atreus,"" it said, ""we used to say that Jove had loved youbetter from first to last than any other hero, for you were captainover many and brave men, when we were all fighting together beforeTroy; yet the hand of death, which no mortal can escape, was laid uponyou all too early. Better for you had you fallen at Troy in thehey-day of your renown, for the Achaeans would have built a mound overyour ashes, and your son would have been heir to your good name,whereas it has now been your lot to come to a most miserable end.""

íííí""Happy son of Peleus,"" answered the ghost of Agamemnon, ""forhaving died at Troy far from Argos, while the bravest of the Trojansand the Achaeans fell round you fighting for your body. There youlay in the whirling clouds of dust, all huge and hugely, heedlessnow of your chivalry. We fought the whole of the livelong day, norshould we ever have left off if Jove had not sent a hurricane tostay us. Then, when we had borne you to the ships out of the fray,we laid you on your bed and cleansed your fair skin with warm waterand with ointments. The Danaans tore their hair and wept bitterlyround about you. Your mother, when she heard, came with her immortalnymphs from out of the sea, and the sound of a great wailing wentforth over the waters so that the Achaeans quaked for fear. They wouldhave fled panic-stricken to their ships had not wise old Nestorwhose counsel was ever truest checked them saying, 'Hold, Argives, flynot sons of the Achaeans, this is his mother coming from the seawith her immortal nymphs to view the body of her son.'

íííí""Thus he spoke, and the Achaeans feared no more. The daughters ofthe old man of the sea stood round you weeping bitterly, and clothedyou in immortal raiment. The nine muses also came and lifted uptheir sweet voices in lament- calling and answering one another; therewas not an Argive but wept for pity of the dirge they chaunted. Daysand nights seven and ten we mourned you, mortals and immortals, but onthe eighteenth day we gave you to the flames, and many a fat sheepwith many an ox did we slay in sacrifice around you. You were burnt inraiment of the gods, with rich resins and with honey, while heroes,horse and foot, clashed their armour round the pile as you wereburning, with the tramp as of a great multitude. But when the flamesof heaven had done their work, we gathered your white bones atdaybreak and laid them in ointments and in pure wine. Your motherbrought us a golden vase to hold them- gift of Bacchus, and work ofVulcan himself; in this we mingled your bleached bones with those ofPatroclus who had gone before you, and separate we enclosed also thoseof Antilochus, who had been closer to you than any other of yourcomrades now that Patroclus was no more.

íííí""Over these the host of the Argives built a noble tomb, on a pointjutting out over the open Hellespont, that it might be seen from farout upon the sea by those now living and by them that shall be bornhereafter. Your mother begged prizes from the gods, and offered themto be contended for by the noblest of the Achaeans. You must have beenpresent at the funeral of many a hero, when the young men girdthemselves and make ready to contend for prizes on the death of somegreat chieftain, but you never saw such prizes as silver-footed Thetisoffered in your honour; for the gods loved you well. Thus even indeath your fame, Achilles, has not been lost, and your name livesevermore among all mankind. But as for me, what solace had I whenthe days of my fighting were done? For Jove willed my destruction onmy return, by the hands of Aegisthus and those of my wicked wife.""

ííííThus did they converse, and presently Mercury came up to them withthe ghosts of the suitors who had been killed by Ulysses. The ghostsof Agamemnon and Achilles were astonished at seeing them, and wentup to them at once. The ghost of Agamemnon recognized Amphimedon sonof Melaneus, who lived in Ithaca and had been his host, so it began totalk to him.

íííí""Amphimedon,"" it said, ""what has happened to all you fine young men-all of an age too- that you are come down here under the ground? Onecould pick no finer body of men from any city. Did Neptune raise hiswinds and waves against you when you were at sea, or did yourenemies make an end of you on the mainland when you werecattle-lifting or sheep-stealing, or while fighting in defence oftheir wives and city? Answer my question, for I have been yourguest. Do you not remember how I came to your house with Menelaus,to persuade Ulysses to join us with his ships against Troy? It was awhole month ere we could resume our voyage, for we had hard work topersuade Ulysses to come with us.""

ííííAnd the ghost of Amphimedon answered, ""Agamemnon, son of Atreus,king of men, I remember everything that you have said, and will tellyou fully and accurately about the way in which our end was broughtabout. Ulysses had been long gone, and we were courting his wife,who did not say point blank that she would not marry, nor yet bringmatters to an end, for she meant to compass our destruction: this,then, was the trick she played us. She set up a great tambour frame inher room and began to work on an enormous piece of fine needlework.'Sweethearts,' said she, 'Ulysses is indeed dead, still, do notpress me to marry again immediately; wait- for I would not have myskill in needlework perish unrecorded- till I have completed a pallfor the hero Laertes, against the time when death shall take him. Heis very rich, and the women of the place will talk if he is laid outwithout a pall.' This is what she said, and we assented; whereuponwe could see her working upon her great web all day long, but at nightshe would unpick the stitches again by torchlight. She fooled us inthis way for three years without our finding it out, but as timewore on and she was now in her fourth year, in the waning of moons andmany days had been accomplished, one of her maids who knew what shewas doing told us, and we caught her in the act of undoing her work,so she had to finish it whether she would or no; and when she showedus the robe she had made, after she had had it washed, its splendourwas as that of the sun or moon.

íííí""Then some malicious god conveyed Ulysses to the upland farm wherehis swineherd lives. Thither presently came also his son, returningfrom a voyage to Pylos, and the two came to the town when they hadhatched their plot for our destruction. Telemachus came first, andthen after him, accompanied by the swineherd, came Ulysses, clad inrags and leaning on a staff as though he were some miserable oldbeggar. He came so unexpectedly that none of us knew him, not even theolder ones among us, and we reviled him and threw things at him. Heendured both being struck and insulted without a word, though he wasin his own house; but when the will of Aegis-bearing Jove inspiredhim, he and Telemachus took the armour and hid it in an inner chamber,bolting the doors behind them. Then he cunningly made his wife offerhis bow and a quantity of iron to be contended for by us ill-fatedsuitors; and this was the beginning of our end, for not one of uscould string the bow- nor nearly do so. When it was about to reach thehands of Ulysses, we all of us shouted out that it should not be givenhim, no matter what he might say, but Telemachus insisted on hishaving it. When he had got it in his hands he strung it with easeand sent his arrow through the iron. Then he stood on the floor of thecloister and poured his arrows on the ground, glaring fiercely abouthim. First he killed Antinous, and then, aiming straight before him,he let fly his deadly darts and they fell thick on one another. It wasplain that some one of the gods was helping them, for they fell uponus with might and main throughout the cloisters, and there was ahideous sound of groaning as our brains were being battered in, andthe ground seethed with our blood. This, Agamemnon, is how we cameby our end, and our bodies are lying still un-cared for in the houseof Ulysses, for our friends at home do not yet know what has happened,so that they cannot lay us out and wash the black blood from ourwounds, making moan over us according to the offices due to thedeparted.""

íííí""Happy Ulysses, son of Laertes,"" replied the ghost of Agamemnon,""you are indeed blessed in the possession of a wife endowed withsuch rare excellence of understanding, and so faithful to her weddedlord as Penelope the daughter of Icarius. The fame, therefore, ofher virtue shall never die, and the immortals shall compose a songthat shall be welcome to all mankind in honour of the constancy ofPenelope. How far otherwise was the wickedness of the daughter ofTyndareus who killed her lawful husband; her song shall be hatefulamong men, for she has brought disgrace on all womankind even on thegood ones.""

ííííThus did they converse in the house of Hades deep down within thebowels of the earth. Meanwhile Ulysses and the others passed out ofthe town and soon reached the fair and well-tilled farm of Laertes,which he had reclaimed with infinite labour. Here was his house,with a lean-to running all round it, where the slaves who worked forhim slept and sat and ate, while inside the house there was an oldSicel woman, who looked after him in this his country-farm. WhenUlysses got there, he said to his son and to the other two:

íííí""Go to the house, and kill the best pig that you can find fordinner. Meanwhile I want to see whether my father will know me, orfail to recognize me after so long an absence.""

ííííHe then took off his armour and gave it to Eumaeus and Philoetius,who went straight on to the house, while he turned off into thevineyard to make trial of his father. As he went down into the greatorchard, he did not see Dolius, nor any of his sons nor of the otherbondsmen, for they were all gathering thorns to make a fence for thevineyard, at the place where the old man had told them; he thereforefound his father alone, hoeing a vine. He had on a dirty old shirt,patched and very shabby; his legs were bound round with thongs ofoxhide to save him from the brambles, and he also wore sleeves ofleather; he had a goat skin cap on his head, and was looking verywoe-begone. When Ulysses saw him so worn, so old and full of sorrow,he stood still under a tall pear tree and began to weep. He doubtedwhether to embrace him, kiss him, and tell him all about his havingcome home, or whether he should first question him and see what hewould say. In the end he deemed it best to be crafty with him, so inthis mind he went up to his father, who was bending down and diggingabout a plant.

íííí""I see, sir,"" said Ulysses, ""that you are an excellent gardener-what pains you take with it, to be sure. There is not a singleplant, not a fig tree, vine, olive, pear, nor flower bed, but bearsthe trace of your attention. I trust, however, that you will not beoffended if I say that you take better care of your garden than ofyourself. You are old, unsavoury, and very meanly clad. It cannot bebecause you are idle that your master takes such poor care of you,indeed your face and figure have nothing of the slave about them,and proclaim you of noble birth. I should have said that you wereone of those who should wash well, eat well, and lie soft at nightas old men have a right to do; but tell me, and tell me true, whosebondman are you, and in whose garden are you working? Tell me alsoabout another matter. Is this place that I have come to really Ithaca?I met a man just now who said so, but he was a dull fellow, and hadnot the patience to hear my story out when I was asking him about anold friend of mine, whether he was still living, or was already deadand in the house of Hades. Believe me when I tell you that this mancame to my house once when I was in my own country and never yet didany stranger come to me whom I liked better. He said that his familycame from Ithaca and that his father was Laertes, son of Arceisius.I received him hospitably, making him welcome to all the abundanceof my house, and when he went away I gave him all customarypresents. I gave him seven talents of fine gold, and a cup of solidsilver with flowers chased upon it. I gave him twelve light cloaks,and as many pieces of tapestry; I also gave him twelve cloaks ofsingle fold, twelve rugs, twelve fair mantles, and an equal numberof shirts. To all this I added four good looking women skilled inall useful arts, and I let him take his choice.""

ííííHis father shed tears and answered, ""Sir, you have indeed come tothe country that you have named, but it is fallen into the hands ofwicked people. All this wealth of presents has been given to nopurpose. If you could have found your friend here alive in Ithaca,he would have entertained you hospitably and would have requiredyour presents amply when you left him- as would have been only rightconsidering what you have already given him. But tell me, and tellme true, how many years is it since you entertained this guest- myunhappy son, as ever was? Alas! He has perished far from his owncountry; the fishes of the sea have eaten him, or he has fallen a preyto the birds and wild beasts of some continent. Neither his mother,nor I his father, who were his parents, could throw our arms about himand wrap him in his shroud, nor could his excellent and richly doweredwife Penelope bewail her husband as was natural upon his death bed,and close his eyes according to the offices due to the departed. Butnow, tell me truly for I want to know. Who and whence are you- tell meof your town and parents? Where is the ship lying that has brought youand your men to Ithaca? Or were you a passenger on some other man'sship, and those who brought you here have gone on their way and leftyou?""

íííí""I will tell you everything,"" answered Ulysses, ""quite truly. I comefrom Alybas, where I have a fine house. I am son of king Apheidas, whois the son of Polypemon. My own name is Eperitus; heaven drove meoff my course as I was leaving Sicania, and I have been carried hereagainst my will. As for my ship it is lying over yonder, off theopen country outside the town, and this is the fifth year sinceUlysses left my country. Poor fellow, yet the omens were good forhim when he left me. The birds all flew on our right hands, and bothhe and I rejoiced to see them as we parted, for we had every hope thatwe should have another friendly meeting and exchange presents.""

ííííA dark cloud of sorrow fell upon Laertes as he listened. He filledboth hands with the dust from off the ground and poured it over hisgrey head, groaning heavily as he did so. The heart of Ulysses wastouched, and his nostrils quivered as he looked upon his father;then he sprang towards him, flung his arms about him and kissed him,saying, ""I am he, father, about whom you are asking- I have returnedafter having been away for twenty years. But cease your sighing andlamentation- we have no time to lose, for I should tell you that Ihave been killing the suitors in my house, to punish them for theirinsolence and crimes.""

íííí""If you really are my son Ulysses,"" replied Laertes, ""and havecome back again, you must give me such manifest proof of your identityas shall convince me.""

íííí""First observe this scar,"" answered Ulysses, ""which I got from aboar's tusk when I was hunting on Mount Parnassus. You and my motherhad sent me to Autolycus, my mother's father, to receive thepresents which when he was over here he had promised to give me.Furthermore I will point out to you the trees in the vineyard whichyou gave me, and I asked you all about them as I followed you roundthe garden. We went over them all, and you told me their names andwhat they all were. You gave me thirteen pear trees, ten appletrees, and forty fig trees; you also said you would give me fifty rowsof vines; there was corn planted between each row, and they yieldgrapes of every kind when the heat of heaven has been laid heavyupon them.""

ííííLaertes' strength failed him when he heard the convincing proofswhich his son had given him. He threw his arms about him, andUlysses had to support him, or he would have gone off into a swoon;but as soon as he came to, and was beginning to recover his senses, hesaid, ""O father Jove, then you gods are still in Olympus after all, ifthe suitors have really been punished for their insolence and folly.Nevertheless, I am much afraid that I shall have all the townspeopleof Ithaca up here directly, and they will be sending messengerseverywhere throughout the cities of the Cephallenians.""

ííííUlysses answered, ""Take heart and do not trouble yourself aboutthat, but let us go into the house hard by your garden. I have alreadytold Telemachus, Philoetius, and Eumaeus to go on there and get dinnerready as soon as possible.""

ííííThus conversing the two made their way towards the house. Whenthey got there they found Telemachus with the stockman and theswineherd cutting up meat and mixing wine with water. Then the oldSicel woman took Laertes inside and washed him and anointed him withoil. She put him on a good cloak, and Minerva came up to him andgave him a more imposing presence, making him taller and stouterthan before. When he came back his son was surprised to see himlooking so like an immortal, and said to him, ""My dear father, someone of the gods has been making you much taller and better-looking.""

ííííLaertes answered, ""Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo,that I were the man I was when I ruled among the Cephallenians, andtook Nericum, that strong fortress on the foreland. If I were stillwhat I then was and had been in our house yesterday with my armour on,I should have been able to stand by you and help you against thesuitors. I should have killed a great many of them, and you would haverejoiced to see it.""

ííííThus did they converse; but the others, when they had finished theirwork and the feast was ready, left off working, and took each hisproper place on the benches and seats. Then they began eating; byand by old Dolius and his sons left their work and came up, fortheir mother, the Sicel woman who looked after Laertes now that he wasgrowing old, had been to fetch them. When they saw Ulysses and werecertain it was he, they stood there lost in astonishment; butUlysses scolded them good-naturedly and said, ""Sit down to yourdinner, old man, and never mind about your surprise; we have beenwanting to begin for some time and have been waiting for you.""

ííííThen Dolius put out both his hands and went up to Ulysses. ""Sir,""said he, seizing his master's hand and kissing it at the wrist, ""wehave long been wishing you home: and now heaven has restored you to usafter we had given up hoping. All hail, therefore, and may the godsprosper you. But tell me, does Penelope already know of your return,or shall we send some one to tell her?""

íííí""Old man,"" answered Ulysses, ""she knows already, so you need nottrouble about that."" On this he took his seat, and the sons ofDolius gathered round Ulysses to give him greeting and embrace him oneafter the other; then they took their seats in due order near Doliustheir father.

ííííWhile they were thus busy getting their dinner ready, Rumour wentround the town, and noised abroad the terrible fate that hadbefallen the suitors; as soon, therefore, as the people heard of itthey gathered from every quarter, groaning and hooting before thehouse of Ulysses. They took the dead away, buried every man his own,and put the bodies of those who came from elsewhere on board thefishing vessels, for the fishermen to take each of them to his ownplace. They then met angrily in the place of assembly, and when theywere got together Eupeithes rose to speak. He was overwhelmed withgrief for the death of his son Antinous, who had been the first mankilled by Ulysses, so he said, weeping bitterly, ""My friend, thisman has done the Achaeans great wrong. He took many of our best menaway with him in his fleet, and he has lost both ships and men; now,moreover, on his return he has been killing all the foremost men amongthe Cephallenians. Let us be up and doing before he can get away toPylos or to Elis where the Epeans rule, or we shall be ashamed ofourselves for ever afterwards. It will be an everlasting disgrace tous if we do not avenge the murder of our sons and brothers. For my ownpart I should have no mote pleasure in life, but had rather die atonce. Let us be up, then, and after them, before they can cross overto the mainland.""

ííííHe wept as he spoke and every one pitied him. But Medon and the bardPhemius had now woke up, and came to them from the house of Ulysses.Every one was astonished at seeing them, but they stood in themiddle of the assembly, and Medon said, ""Hear me, men of Ithaca.Ulysses did not do these things against the will of heaven. I myselfsaw an immortal god take the form of Mentor and stand beside him. Thisgod appeared, now in front of him encouraging him, and now goingfuriously about the court and attacking the suitors whereon theyfell thick on one another.""

ííííOn this pale fear laid hold of them, and old Halitherses, son ofMastor, rose to speak, for he was the only man among them who knewboth past and future; so he spoke to them plainly and in allhonesty, saying,

íííí""Men of Ithaca, it is all your own fault that things have turned outas they have; you would not listen to me, nor yet to Mentor, when webade you check the folly of your sons who were doing much wrong in thewantonness of their hearts- wasting the substance and dishonouring thewife of a chieftain who they thought would not return. Now, however,let it be as I say, and do as I tell you. Do not go out againstUlysses, or you may find that you have been drawing down evil onyour own heads.""

ííííThis was what he said, and more than half raised a loud shout, andat once left the assembly. But the rest stayed where they were, forthe speech of Halitherses displeased them, and they sided withEupeithes; they therefore hurried off for their armour, and whenthey had armed themselves, they met together in front of the city, andEupeithes led them on in their folly. He thought he was going toavenge the murder of his son, whereas in truth he was never to return,but was himself to perish in his attempt.

ííííThen Minerva said to Jove, ""Father, son of Saturn, king of kings,answer me this question- What do you propose to do? Will you setthem fighting still further, or will you make peace between them?""

ííííAnd Jove answered, ""My child, why should you ask me? Was it not byyour own arrangement that Ulysses came home and took his revengeupon the suitors? Do whatever you like, but I will tell you what Ithink will be most reasonable arrangement. Now that Ulysses isrevenged, let them swear to a solemn covenant, in virtue of which heshall continue to rule, while we cause the others to forgive andforget the massacre of their sons and brothers. Let them then allbecome friends as heretofore, and let peace and plenty reign.""

ííííThis was what Minerva was already eager to bring about, so downshe darted from off the topmost summits of Olympus.

ííííNow when Laertes and the others had done dinner, Ulysses began bysaying, ""Some of you go out and see if they are not getting close upto us."" So one of Dolius's sons went as he was bid. Standing on thethreshold he could see them all quite near, and said to Ulysses, ""Herethey are, let us put on our armour at once.""

ííííThey put on their armour as fast as they could- that is to sayUlysses, his three men, and the six sons of Dolius. Laertes also andDolius did the same- warriors by necessity in spite of their greyhair. When they had all put on their armour, they opened the gateand sallied forth, Ulysses leading the way.

ííííThen Jove's daughter Minerva came up to them, having assumed theform and voice of Mentor. Ulysses was glad when he saw her, and saidto his son Telemachus, ""Telemachus, now that are about to fight inan engagement, which will show every man's mettle, be sure not todisgrace your ancestors, who were eminent for their strength andcourage all the world over.""

íííí""You say truly, my dear father,"" answered Telemachus, ""and you shallsee, if you will, that I am in no mind to disgrace your family.""

ííííLaertes was delighted when he heard this. ""Good heavens, heexclaimed, ""what a day I am enjoying: I do indeed rejoice at it. Myson and grandson are vying with one another in the matter of valour.""

ííííOn this Minerva came close up to him and said, ""Son of Arceisius-best friend I have in the world- pray to the blue-eyed damsel, andto Jove her father; then poise your spear and hurl it.""

ííííAs she spoke she infused fresh vigour into him, and when he hadprayed to her he poised his spear and hurled it. He hit Eupeithes'helmet, and the spear went right through it, for the helmet stayedit not, and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily tothe ground. Meantime Ulysses and his son fell the front line of thefoe and smote them with their swords and spears; indeed, they wouldhave killed every one of them, and prevented them from ever gettinghome again, only Minerva raised her voice aloud, and made every onepause. ""Men of Ithaca,"" she cried, cease this dreadful war, and settlethe matter at once without further bloodshed.""

ííííOn this pale fear seized every one; they were so frightened thattheir arms dropped from their hands and fell upon the ground at thesound of the goddess's voice, and they fled back to the city for theirlives. But Ulysses gave a great cry, and gathering himself togetherswooped down like a soaring eagle. Then the son of Saturn sent athunderbolt of fire that fell just in front of Minerva, so she said toUlysses, ""Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, stop this warful strife, orJove will be angry with you.""

ííííThus spoke Minerva, and Ulysses obeyed her gladly. Then Minervaassumed the form and voice of Mentor, and presently made a covenant ofpeace between the two contending parties.

ííííTHE TRANSLATOR'S ORIGINAL DEDICATION.

ííííTO THE COUNTESS GRANVILLE.

ííííMY DEAR LADY GRANVILLE,--

ííííTHE reluctance which must naturally be felt by any one inventuring to give to the world a book such as the present, wherethe beauties of the great original must inevitably be diminished,if not destroyed, in the process of passing through thetranslator's hands, cannot but be felt in all its force when thattranslator has not penetrated beyond the outer courts of thepoetic fane, and can have no hope of advancing further, or ofreaching its sanctuary. But it is to me a subject of peculiarsatisfaction that your kind permission to have your nameinscribed upon this page serves to attain a twofold end--onedirect and personal, and relating to the present day; the otherreflected and historical, and belonging to times long gone by. Ofthe first little need now be said, for the privilege is whollymine, in making this dedication: as to the second, one word ofexplanation will suffice for those who have made the greatestpoet of Germany, almost of the world, their study, and to whomthe story of his life is not unknown. All who have followed thecareer of GOETHE are familiar with the name and character ofDALBERG, and also with the deep and lasting friendship thatexisted between them, from which SCHILLER too was not absent;recalling to the mind the days of old, when a Virgil and a Horaceand a Maecenas sat side by side.

ííííRemembering, then, the connection that, in a former century,was formed and riveted between your illustrious ancestor and himwhom it is the object of these pages to represent, I deem it ahappy augury that the link then established finds itself notwholly severed even now (although its strength may beimmeasurably weakened in the comparison), inasmuch as this pagebrings them once more in contact, the one in the person of hisown descendant, the other in that of the translator of his Poems.

ííííBelieve me, with great truth,Very faithfully yours,EDGAR A. BOWRING.London, April, 1853.

ííííORIGINAL PREFACE.

ííííI feel no small reluctance in venturing to give to the public awork of the character of that indicated by the title-page to thepresent volume; for, difficult as it must always be to rendersatisfactorily into one's own tongue the writings of the bards ofother lands, the responsibility assumed by the translator isimmeasurably increased when he attempts to transfer the thoughtsof those great men, who have lived for all the world and for allages, from the language in which they were originally clothed, toone to which they may as yet have been strangers. Preeminentlyis this the case with Goethe, the most masterly of all the masterminds of modern times, whose name is already inscribed on thetablets of immortality, and whose fame already extends over theearth, although as yet only in its infancy. Scarcely have twodecades passed away since he ceased to dwell among men, yet henow stands before us, not as a mere individual, like those whomthe world is wont to call great, but as a type, as an emblem--therecognised emblem and representative of the human mind in itspresent stage of culture and advancement.

ííííAmong the infinitely varied effusions of Goethe's pen, perhapsthere are none which are of as general interest as his Poems,which breathe the very spirit of Nature, and embody the realmusic of the feelings. In Germany, they are universally known,and are considered as the most delightful of his works. Yet inthis country, this kindred country, sprung from the same stem,and so strongly resembling her sister in so many points, they arenearly unknown. Almost the only poetical work of the greatestPoet that the world has seen for ages, that is really andgenerally read in England, is Faust, the translations of whichare almost endless; while no single person has as yet appeared toattempt to give, in an English dress, in any collective orsystematic manner, those smaller productions of the genius ofGoethe which it is the object of the present volume to lay beforethe reader, whose indulgence is requested for its manyimperfections. In addition to the beauty of the language in whichthe Poet has given utterance to his thoughts, there is a depth ofmeaning in those thoughts which is not easily discoverable atfirst sight, and the translator incurs great risk of overlookingit, and of giving a prosaic effect to that which in the originalcontains the very essence of poetry. It is probably thisdifficulty that has deterred others from undertaking the task Ihave set myself, and in which I do not pretend to do more thanattempt to give an idea of the minstrelsy of one so unrivalled,by as truthful an interpretation of it as lies in my power.

ííííThe principles which have guided me on the present occasion arethe same as those followed in the translation of Schiller'scomplete Poems that was published by me in 1851, namely, asliteral a rendering of the original as is consistent with goodEnglish, and also a very strict adherence to the metre of theoriginal. Although translators usually allow themselves greatlicense in both these points, it appears to me that by so doingthey of necessity destroy the very soul of the work they professto translate. In fact, it is not a translation, but a paraphrasethat they give. It may perhaps be thought that the presenttranslations go almost to the other extreme, and that a renderingof metre, line for line, and word for word, makes it impossibleto preserve the poetry of the original both in substance and insound. But experience has convinced me that it is not so, andthat great fidelity is even the most essential element ofsuccess, whether in translating poetry or prose. It was thereforevery satisfactory to me to find that the principle laid down byme to myself in translating Schiller met with the very general,if not universal, approval of the reader. At the same time, Ihave endeavoured to profit in the case of this, the younger bornof the two attempts made by me to transplant the muse of Germanyto the shores of Britain, by the criticisms, whether friendly orhostile, that have been evoked or provoked by the appearance ofits elder brother.

ííííAs already mentioned, the latter contained the whole of thePoems of Schiller. It is impossible, in anything like the samecompass, to give all the writings of Goethe comprised under thegeneral title of Gedichte, or poems. They contain between 30,000and 40,000 verses, exclusive of his plays. and similar works.Very many of these would be absolutely without interest to theEnglish reader,--such as those having only a local application,those addressed to individuals, and so on. Others again, fromtheir extreme length, could only be published in separatevolumes. But the impossibility of giving all need form noobstacle to giving as much as possible; and it so happens thatthe real interest of Goethe's Poems centres in those classes ofthem which are not too diffuse to run any risk when translated ofoffending the reader by their too great number. Those by far themore generally admired are the Songs and Ballads, which are about150 in number, and the whole of which are contained in thisvolume (with the exception of one or two of the former, whichhave been, on consideration, left out by me owing to theirtrifling and uninteresting nature). The same may be said of theOdes, Sonnets, Miscellaneous Poems, &c.

ííííIn addition to those portions of Goethe's poetical works whichare given in this complete form, specimens of the different otherclasses of them, such as the Epigrams, Elegies, &c., are added,as well as a collection of the various Songs found in his Plays,making a total number of about 400 Poems, embraced in the presentvolume.

ííííA sketch of the life of Goethe is prefixed, in order that thereader may have before him both the Poet himself and the Poet'soffspring, and that he may see that the two are but one--thatGoethe lives in his works, that his works lived in him.

ííííThe dates of the different Poems are appended throughout, thatof the first publication being given, when that of thecomposition is unknown. The order of arrangement adopted is thatof the authorized German editions. As Goethe would never arrangethem himself in the chronological order of their composition, ithas become impossible to do so, now that he is dead. The planadopted in the present volume would therefore seem to be thebest, as it facilitates reference to the original. Thecircumstances attending or giving rise to the production of anyof the Poems will be found specified in those cases in which theyhave been ascertained by me.

ííííHaving said thus much by way of explanation, I now leave thebook to speak for itself, and to testify to its own character.Whether viewed with a charitable eye by the kindly reader, whowill make due allowance for the difficulties attending itsexecution, or received by the critic, who will judge of it onlyby its own merits, with the unfriendly welcome which it veryprobably deserves, I trust that I shall at least be pardoned formaking an attempt, a failure in which does not necessarily implydisgrace, and which, by leading the way, may perhaps become themeans of inducing some abler and more worthy (but not moreearnest) labourer to enter upon the same field, the riches ofwhich will remain unaltered and undiminished in value, evenalthough they may be for the moment tarnished by the hands of theless skilful workman who first endeavours to transplant them to aforeign soil.

ííííPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.

ííííI have taken advantage of the publication of a Second Editionof my translation of the Poems of Goethe (originally published in1853), to add to the Collection a version of the much admiredclassical Poem of Hermann and Dorothea, which was previouslyomitted by me in consequence of its length. Its universalpopularity, however, and the fact that it exhibits theversatility of Goethe's talents to a greater extent than,perhaps, any other of his poetical works, seem to call for itsadmission into the present volume.

ííííOn the other hand I have not thought it necessary to includethe sketch of Goethe's Life that accompanied the First Edition.At the time of its publication, comparatively little was known inthis country of the incidents of his career, and my sketch wasavowedly written as a temporary stop-gap, as it were, pending theproduction of some work really deserving the tittle of a life ofGoethe. Not to mention other contributions to the literature ofthe subject, Mr. Lewis's important volumes give the Englishreader all the information he is likely to require respectingGoethe's career, and my short memoir appeared to be no longerrequired.

ííííI need scarcely add that I have availed myself of thisopportunity to make whatever improvements have suggestedthemselves to me in my original version of these Poems.

ííííTHE POEMS OF GOETHE.

ííííDEDICATION.

ííííThe morn arrived; his footstep quickly scared

ííííThe gentle sleep that round my senses clung,And I, awak'ning, from my cottage fared,

ííííAnd up the mountain side with light heart sprung;At every step I felt my gaze ensnared

ííííBy new-born flow'rs that full of dew-drops hung;The youthful day awoke with ecstacy,And all things quicken'd were, to quicken me.

ííííAnd as I mounted, from the valley rose

ííííA streaky mist, that upward slowly spread,Then bent, as though my form it would enclose,

ííííThen, as on pinions, soar'd above my head:My gaze could now on no fair view repose,

ííííin mournful veil conceal'd, the world seem'd dead;The clouds soon closed around me, as a tomb,And I was left alone in twilight gloom.

ííííAt once the sun his lustre seem'd to pour,

ííííAnd through the mist was seen a radiant light;Here sank it gently to the ground once more,

ííííThere parted it, and climb'd o'er wood and height.How did I yearn to greet him as of yore,

ííííAfter the darkness waxing doubly bright!The airy conflict ofttimes was renew'd,Then blinded by a dazzling glow I stood.

ííííEre long an inward impulse prompted me

ííííA hasty glance with boldness round to throw;At first mine eyes had scarcely strength to see,

ííííFor all around appear'd to burn and glow.Then saw I, on the clouds borne gracefully,

ííííA godlike woman hov'ring to and fro.In life I ne'er had seen a form so fair--She gazed at me, and still she hover'd there.

íííí""Dost thou not know me?"" were the words she said

ííííIn tones where love and faith were sweetly bound;""Knowest thou not Her who oftentimes hath shed

ííííThe purest balsam in each earthly wound?Thou knows't me well; thy panting heart I led

ííííTo join me in a bond with rapture crown'd.Did I not see thee, when a stripling, yearningTo welcome me with tears, heartfelt and burning?""

íííí""Yes!"" I exclaim'd, whilst, overcome with joy,

ííííI sank to earth; ""I long have worshipp'd thee;Thou gav'st me rest, when passions rack'd the boy,

ííííPervading ev'ry limb unceasingly;Thy heav'nly pinions thou didst then employ

ííííThe scorching sunbeams to ward off from me.From thee alone Earth's fairest gifts I gain'd,Through thee alone, true bliss can be obtain'd.

íííí""Thy name I know not; yet I hear thee nam'd

ííííBy many a one who boasts thee as his own;Each eye believes that tow'rd thy form 'tis aim'd,

ííííYet to most eyes thy rays are anguish-sown.Ah! whilst I err'd, full many a friend I claim'd,

ííííNow that I know thee, I am left alone;With but myself can I my rapture share,I needs must veil and hide thy radiance fair.

ííííShe smiled, and answering said: ""Thou see'st how wise,

ííííHow prudent 'twas but little to unveil!Scarce from the clumsiest cheat are clear'd thine eyes,

ííííScarce hast thou strength thy childish bars to scale,When thou dost rank thee 'mongst the deities,

ííííAnd so man's duties to perform would'st fail!How dost thou differ from all other men?Live with the world in peace, and know thee then!""

íííí""Oh, pardon me,"" I cried, ""I meant it well:

ííííNot vainly did'st thou bless mine eyes with light;For in my blood glad aspirations swell,

ííííThe value of thy gifts I know aright!Those treasures in my breast for others dwell,

ííííThe buried pound no more I'll hide from sight.Why did I seek the road so anxiously,If hidden from my brethren 'twere to be?""

ííííAnd as I answer'd, tow'rd me turn'd her face,

ííííWith kindly sympathy, that god-like one;Within her eye full plainly could I trace

ííííWhat I had fail'd in, and what rightly done.She smiled, and cured me with that smile's sweet grace,

ííííTo new-born joys my spirit soar'd anon;With inward confidence I now could dareTo draw yet closer, and observe her there.

ííííThrough the light cloud she then stretch'd forth her hand,

ííííAs if to bid the streaky vapour fly:At once it seemed to yield to her command,

ííííContracted, and no mist then met mine eye.My glance once more survey'd the smiling land,

ííííUnclouded and serene appear'd the sky.Nought but a veil of purest white she held,And round her in a thousand folds it swell'd.

íííí""I know thee, and I know thy wav'ring will.

ííííI know the good that lives and glows in thee!""--Thus spake she, and methinks I hear her still--

íííí""The prize long destined, now receive from me;That blest one will be safe from ev'ry ill,

ííííWho takes this gift with soul of purity,--""The veil of Minstrelsy from Truth's own hand,Of sunlight and of morn's sweet fragrance plann'd.

íííí""And when thou and thy friends at fierce noon-day

ííííAre parched with heat, straight cast it in the air!Then Zephyr's cooling breath will round you play,

ííííDistilling balm and flowers' sweet incense there;The tones of earthly woe will die away,

ííííThe grave become a bed of clouds so fair,To sing to rest life's billows will be seen,The day be lovely, and the night serene.""--

ííííCome, then, my friends! and whensoe'er ye find

ííííUpon your way increase life's heavy load;If by fresh-waken'd blessings flowers are twin'd

ííííAround your path, and golden fruits bestow'd,We'll seek the coming day with joyous mind!

ííííThus blest, we'll live, thus wander on our roadAnd when our grandsons sorrow o'er our tomb,Our love, to glad their bosoms, still shall bloom.

ííííSONGS.-----Late resounds the early strain;Weal and woe in song remain.-----SOUND, SWEET SONG.

ííííSOUND, sweet song, from some far land,Sighing softly close at hand,

ííííNow of joy, and now of woe!

ííííStars are wont to glimmer so.

ííííSooner thus will good unfold;Children young and children oldGladly hear thy numbers flow.

íííí1820.*-----

íííí* In the cases in which the date is marked thus (*), itsignifies the original date of publication--the year ofcomposition not being known. In other cases, the date given isthat of the actual composition. All the poems are arranged in theorder of the recognised German editions.-----TO THE KIND READER.

ííííNo one talks more than a Poet;Fain he'd have the people know it.

ííííPraise or blame he ever loves;None in prose confess an error,Yet we do so, void of terror,

ííííIn the Muses' silent groves.

ííííWhat I err'd in, what corrected,What I suffer'd, what effected,

ííííTo this wreath as flow'rs belong;For the aged, and the youthful,And the vicious, and the truthful,

ííííAll are fair when viewed in song.

íííí1800.*-----THE NEW AMADIS.

ííííIN my boyhood's days so drear

ííííI was kept confined;There I sat for many a year,

ííííAll alone I pined,As within the womb.

ííííYet thou drov'st away my gloom,

ííííGolden phantasy!I became a hero true,

ííííLike the Prince Pipi,And the world roam'd through,

ííííMany a crystal palace built,

ííííCrush'd them with like art,And the Dragon's life-blood spilt

ííííWith my glitt'ring dart.Yes! I was a man!

ííííNext I formed the knightly plan

ííííPrincess Fish to free;She was much too complaisant,

ííííKindly welcomed me,--And I was gallant.

ííííHeav'nly bread her kisses proved,

ííííGlowing as the wine;Almost unto death I loved.

ííííSun-s appeared to shineIn her dazzling charms.

ííííWho hath torn her from mine arms?

ííííCould no magic bandMake her in her flight delay?

ííííSay, where now her land?Where, alas, the way?

íííí1775.*-----WHEN THE FOX DIES, HIS SKIN COUNTS.*

íííí(* The name of a game, known in English as ""Jack's alight."")

ííííWE young people in the shade

ííííSat one sultry day;Cupid came, and ""Dies the Fox""

ííííWith us sought to play.

ííííEach one of my friends then sat

ííííBy his mistress dear;Cupid, blowing out the torch,

ííííSaid: ""The taper's here!""

ííííThen we quickly sent around

ííííThe expiring brand;Each one put it hastily

ííííln his neighbour's hand.

ííííDorilis then gave it me,

ííííWith a scoffing jest;Sudden into flame it broke,

ííííBy my fingers press'd.

ííííAnd it singed my eyes and face,

ííííSet my breast on fire;Then above my head the blaze

ííííMounted ever higher.

ííííVain I sought to put it out;

ííííEver burned the flame;Stead of dying, soon the Fox

ííííLivelier still became.

íííí1770.-----THE HEATHROSE.

ííííONCE a boy a Rosebud spied,

ííííHeathrose fair and tender,All array'd in youthful pride,--Quickly to the spot he hied,

ííííRavished by her splendour.Rosebud, rosebud, rosebud red,

ííííHeathrose fair and tender!

ííííSaid the boy, ""I'll now pick thee,

ííííHeathrose fair and tender!""Said the rosebud, ""I'll prick thee,So that thou'lt remember me,

ííííNe'er will I surrender!""Rosebud, rosebud, rosebud red,

ííííHeathrose fair and tender!

ííííNow the cruel boy must pick

ííííHeathrose fair and tender;Rosebud did her best to prick,--Vain 'twas 'gainst her fate to kick--

ííííShe must needs surrender.Rosebud, rosebud, rosebud red,

ííííHeathrose fair and tender!

íííí1779.*-----BLINDMAN'S BUFF.

ííííOH, my Theresa dear!Thine eyes, I greatly fear,

ííííCan through the bandage see!Although thine eyes are bound,By thee I'm quickly found,

ííííAnd wherefore shouldst thou catch but me?

ííííEre long thou held'st me fast,With arms around me cast,

ííííUpon thy breast I fell;Scarce was thy bandage gone,When all my joy was flown,

ííííThou coldly didst the blind repel.

ííííHe groped on ev'ry side,His limbs he sorely tried,

ííííWhile scoffs arose all round;If thou no love wilt give,In sadness I shall live,

ííííAs if mine eyes remain'd still bound.

íííí1770.-----CHRISTEL.

ííííMy senses ofttimes are oppress'd,

ííííOft stagnant is my blood;But when by Christel's sight I'm blest,

ííííI feel my strength renew'd.I see her here, I see her there,

ííííAnd really cannot tellThe manner how, the when, the where,

ííííThe why I love her well.

ííííIf with the merest glance I view

ííííHer black and roguish eyes,And gaze on her black eyebrows too,

ííííMy spirit upward flies.Has any one a mouth so sweet,

ííííSuch love-round cheeks as she?Ah, when the eye her beauties meet,

ííííIt ne'er content can be.

ííííAnd when in airy German dance

ííííI clasp her form divine,So quick we whirl, so quick advance,

ííííWhat rapture then like mine!And when she's giddy, and feels warm,

ííííI cradle her, poor thing,Upon my breast, and in mine arm,--

ííííI'm then a very king!

ííííAnd when she looks with love on me,

ííííForgetting all but this,When press'd against my bosom, she

ííííExchanges kiss for kiss,All through my marrow runs a thrill,

ííííRuns e'en my foot along!I feel so well, I feel so ill,

ííííI feel so weak, so strong!

ííííWould that such moments ne'er would end!

ííííThe day ne'er long I find;Could I the night too with her spend,

ííííE'en that I should not mind.If she were in mine arms but held,

ííííTo quench love's thirst I'd try;And could my torments not be quell'd,

ííííUpon her breast would die.

íííí1776.*------THE COY ONE.

ííííONE Spring-morning bright and fair,

ííííRoam'd a shepherdess and sang;Young and beauteous, free from care,

ííííThrough the fields her clear notes rang:So, Ia, Ia! le ralla, &c.

ííííOf his lambs some two or three

ííííThyrsis offer'd for a kiss;First she eyed him roguishly,

ííííThen for answer sang but this:So, Ia, Ia! le ralla, &c.

ííííRibbons did the next one offer,

ííííAnd the third, his heart so trueBut, as with the lambs, the scoffer

ííííLaugh'd at heart and ribbons too,--Still 'twas Ia! le ralla, &c.

íííí1791.-----THE CONVERT.

ííííAs at sunset I was straying

ííííSilently the wood along,Damon on his flute was playing,

ííííAnd the rocks gave back the song,So la, Ia! &c.

ííííSoftly tow'rds him then he drew me;

ííííSweet each kiss he gave me then!And I said, ""Play once more to me!""

ííííAnd he kindly play'd again,So la, la! &c.

ííííAll my peace for aye has fleeted,

ííííAll my happiness has flown;Yet my ears are ever greeted

ííííWith that olden, blissful tone,So la, la! &c.

íííí1791.-----PRESERVATION.

ííííMy maiden she proved false to me;

ííííTo hate all joys I soon began,

ííííThen to a flowing stream I ran,--The stream ran past me hastily.

ííííThere stood I fix'd, in mute despair;

ííííMy head swam round as in a dream;

ííííI well-nigh fell into the stream,And earth seem'd with me whirling there.

ííííSudden I heard a voice that cried--

ííííI had just turn'd my face from thence--

ííííIt was a voice to charm each sense:""Beware, for deep is yonder tide!""

ííííA thrill my blood pervaded now,

ííííI look'd and saw a beauteous maid

ííííI asked her name--twas Kate, she said--""Oh lovely Kate! how kind art thou!

íííí""From death I have been sav'd by thee,

íííí'Tis through thee only that I live;

ííííLittle 'twere life alone to give,My joy in life then deign to be!""

ííííAnd then I told my sorrows o'er,

ííííHer eyes to earth she sweetly threw;

ííííI kiss'd her, and she kiss'd me too,And--then I talked of death no more.

íííí1775.*-----THE MUSES' SON.

íííí[Goethe quotes the beginning of this song in his Autobiography,as expressing the manner in which his poetical effusions used topour out from him.]

ííííTHROUGH field and wood to stray,And pipe my tuneful lay,--

íííí'Tis thus my days are pass'd;And all keep tune with me,And move in harmony,

ííííAnd so on, to the last.

ííííTo wait I scarce have powerThe garden's earliest flower,

ííííThe tree's first bloom in Spring;They hail my joyous strain,--When Winter comes again,

ííííOf that sweet dream I sing.

ííííMy song sounds far and near,O'er ice it echoes clear,

ííííThen Winter blossoms bright;And when his blossoms fly,Fresh raptures meet mine eye,

ííííUpon the well-till'd height.

ííííWhen 'neath the linden tree,Young folks I chance to see,

ííííI set them moving soon;His nose the dull lad curls,The formal maiden whirls,

ííííObedient to my tune.

ííííWings to the feet ye lend,O'er hill and vale ye send

ííííThe lover far from home;When shall I, on your breast,.

ííííYe kindly muses, rest,And cease at length to roam?

íííí1800.*------FOUND.

ííííONCE through the forest

ííííAlone I went;To seek for nothing

ííííMy thoughts were bent.

ííííI saw i' the shadow

ííííA flower stand thereAs stars it glisten'd,

ííííAs eyes 'twas fair.

ííííI sought to pluck it,--

ííííIt gently said:""Shall I be gather'd

ííííOnly to fade?""

ííííWith all its roots

ííííI dug it with care,And took it home

ííííTo my garden fair.

ííííIn silent corner

ííííSoon it was set;There grows it ever,

ííííThere blooms it yet.

íííí1815.*-----LIKE AND LIKE.

ííííA FAIR bell-flower

ííííSprang tip from the ground;And early its fragrance

ííííIt shed all around;A bee came thither

ííííAnd sipp'd from its bell;That they for each other

ííííWere made, we see well.

íííí1814.-----RECIPROCAL INVITATION TO THE DANCE.

ííííTHE INDIFFERENT.

ííííCOME to the dance with me, come with me, fair one!

ííííDances a feast-day like this may well crown.If thou my sweetheart art not, thou canst be so,

ííííBut if thou wilt not, we still will dance on.Come to the dance with me, come with me, fair one!

ííííDances a feast-day like this may well crown.

ííííTHE TENDER.

ííííLoved one, without thee, what then would all feast be?

ííííSweet one, without thee, what then were the dance?If thou my sweetheart wert not, I would dance not.

ííííIf thou art still so, all life is one feast.Loved one, without thee, what then would all feasts be?

ííííSweet one, without thee, what then were the dance?

ííííTHE INDIFFERENT.

ííííLet them but love, then, and leave us the dancing!

ííííLanguishing love cannot bear the glad dance.Let us whirl round in the waltz's gay measure,

ííííAnd let them steal to the dim-lighted wood.Let them but love, then, and leave us the dancing!

ííííLanguishing love cannot bear the glad dance.

ííííTHE TENDER.

ííííLet them whirl round, then, and leave us to wander!

ííííWand'ring to love is a heavenly dance.Cupid, the near one, o'erhears their deriding,

ííííVengeance takes suddenly, vengeance takes soon.Let them whirl round, then, and leave us to wander!

ííííWand'ring to love is a heavenly dance.

íííí1789.*-----SELF-DECEIT.

ííííMy neighbour's curtain, well I see,

ííííIs moving to and fin.No doubt she's list'ning eagerly,

ííííIf I'm at home or no.

ííííAnd if the jealous grudge I bore

ííííAnd openly confess'd,Is nourish'd by me as before,

ííííWithin my inmost breast.

ííííAlas! no fancies such as these

ííííE'er cross'd the dear child's thoughts.I see 'tis but the ev'ning breeze

ííííThat with the curtain sports.

íííí1803.-----DECLARATION OF WAR.

ííííOH, would I resembled

ííííThe country girls fair,Who rosy-red ribbons

ííííAnd yellow hats wear!

ííííTo believe I was pretty

ííííI thought was allow'd;In the town I believed it

ííííWhen by the youth vow'd.

ííííNow that Spring hath return'd,

ííííAll my joys disappear;The girls of the country

ííííHave lured him from here.

ííííTo change dress and figure,

ííííWas needful I found,My bodice is longer,

ííííMy petticoat round.

ííííMy hat now is yellow.

ííííMy bodice like snow;The clover to sickle

ííííWith others I go.

ííííSomething pretty, e'er long

ííííMidst the troop he explores;The eager boy signs me

ííííTo go within doors.

ííííI bashfully go,--

ííííWho I am, he can't trace;He pinches my cheeks,

ííííAnd he looks in my face.

ííííThe town girl now threatens

ííííYou maidens with war;Her twofold charms pledges .

ííííOf victory are.

íííí1803.-----LOVER IN ALL SHAPES.

ííííTo be like a fish,Brisk and quick, is my wish;If thou cam'st with thy line.Thou wouldst soon make me thine.To be like a fish,Brisk and quick, is my wish.

ííííOh, were I a steed!Thou wouldst love me indeed.Oh, were I a carFit to bear thee afar!Oh, were I a steed!Thou wouldst love me indeed.

ííííI would I were goldThat thy fingers might hold!If thou boughtest aught then,I'd return soon again.I would I were goldThat thy fingers might hold!

ííííI would I were true,And my sweetheart still new!To be faithful I'd swear,And would go away ne'er.I would I were true,And my sweetheart still new!

ííííI would I were old,And wrinkled and cold,So that if thou said'st No,I could stand such a blow!I would I were old,And wrinkled and cold.

ííííAn ape I would be,Full of mischievous glee;If aught came to vex thee,I'd plague and perplex thee.An ape I would be,Full of mischievous glee

ííííAs a lamb I'd behave,As a lion be brave,As a lynx clearly see,As a fox cunning be.As a lamb I'd behave,As a lion be brave.

ííííWhatever I were,All on thee I'd confer;With the gifts of a princeMy affection evince.Whatever I were,All on thee I'd confer.

ííííAs nought diff'rent can make me,As I am thou must take me!If I'm not good enough,Thou must cut thine own stuff.As nought diff'rent can make me,As I am thou must take me!

íííí1815.*-----THE GOLDSMITH'S APPRENTICE.

ííííMy neighbour, none can e'er deny,

ííííIs a most beauteous maid;Her shop is ever in mine eye,

ííííWhen working at my trade.

ííííTo ring and chain I hammer then

ííííThe wire of gold assay'd,And think the while: ""For Kate, oh when

ííííWill such a ring be made?""

ííííAnd when she takes her shutters down,

ííííHer shop at once invade,To buy and haggle, all the town,

ííííFor all that's there displayd.

ííííI file, and maybe overfile

ííííThe wire of gold assay'd;My master grumbles all the while,--

ííííHer shop the mischief made.

ííííTo ply her wheel she straight begins,

ííííWhen not engaged in trade;I know full well for what she spins,--

íííí'Tis hope guides that dear maid.

ííííHer leg, while her small foot treads on,

ííííIs in my mind portray'd;Her garter I recall anon,--

ííííI gave it that dear maid.

ííííThen to her lips the finest thread

ííííIs by her hand convey'd.Were I there only in its stead,

ííííHow I would kiss the maid!

íííí1808.-----ANSWERS IN A GAME OF QUESTIONS.

ííííTHE LADY.

ííííIN the small and great world too,

ííííWhat most charms a woman's heart?It is doubtless what is new,

ííííFor its blossoms joy impart;Nobler far is what is true,

ííííFor fresh blossoms it can shoot

ííííEven in the time of fruit.

ííííTHE YOUNG GENTLEMAN.

ííííWith the Nymphs in wood and cave

ííííParis was acquainted well,Till Zeus sent, to make him rave,

ííííThree of those in Heav'n who dwell;And the choice more trouble gave

ííííThan e'er fell to mortal lot,

ííííWhether in old times or not.

ííííTHE EXPERIENCED.

ííííTenderly a woman view,

ííííAnd thoult win her, take my word;He who's quick and saucy too,

ííííWill of all men be preferr'd;Who ne'er seems as if he knew

ííííIf he pleases, if he charms,--

ííííHe 'tis injures, he 'tis harms.

ííííTHE CONTENTED.

ííííManifold is human strife,

ííííHuman passion, human pain;Many a blessing yet is rife,

ííííMany pleasures still remain.Yet the greatest bliss in life,

ííííAnd the richest prize we find,

ííííIs a good, contented mind.

ííííTHE MERRY COUNSEL.

ííííHe by whom man's foolish will

ííííIs each day review'd and blamed,Who, when others fools are still,

ííííIs himself a fool proclaim'd,--Ne'er at mill was beast's back press'd

ííííWith a heavier load than he.What I feel within my breast

ííííThat in truth's the thing for me!

íííí1789.-----DIFFERENT EMOTIONS ON THE SAME SPOT.

ííííTHE MAIDEN.

ííííI'VE seen him before me!What rapture steals o'er me!

ííííOh heavenly sight!He's coming to meet me;Perplex'd, I retreat me,

ííííWith shame take to flight.My mind seems to wander!Ye rocks and trees yonder,

ííííConceal ye my rapture.

ííííConceal my delight!

ííííTHE YOUTH.

íííí'Tis here I must find her,'Twas here she enshrined her,

ííííHere vanish'd from sight.She came, as to meet me,Then fearing to greet me,

ííííWith shame took to flight.Is't hope? Do I wander?Ye rocks and trees yonder,

ííííDisclose ye the loved one,

ííííDisclose my delight!

ííííTHE LANGUISHING.

ííííO'er my sad, fate I sorrow,To each dewy morrow,

ííííVeil'd here from man's sightBy the many mistaken,Unknown and forsaken,

ííííHere I wing my flight!Compassionate spirit!Let none ever hear it,--

ííííConceal my affliction,

ííííConceal thy delight!

ííííTHE HUNTER.

ííííTo-day I'm rewarded;Rich booty's afforded

ííííBy Fortune so bright.My servant the pheasants,And hares fit for presents

ííííTakes homeward at night;Here see I enrapturedIn nets the birds captured!--

ííííLong life to the hunter!

ííííLong live his delight!

íííí1789.-----WHO'LL BUY GODS OF LOVE?

ííííOF all the beauteous waresExposed for sale at fairs,None will give more delightThan those that to your sightFrom distant lands we bring.Oh, hark to what we sing!These beauteous birds behold,They're brought here to be sold.

ííííAnd first the big one see,So full of roguish glee!With light and merry boundHe leaps upon the ground;Then springs up on the bougd,We will not praise him now.The merry bird behold,--He's brought here to be sold.

ííííAnd now the small one see!A modest look has he,And yet he's such apotherAs his big roguish brother.'Tis chiefly when all's stillHe loves to show his will.The bird so small and bold,--He's brought here to be sold.

ííííObserve this little love,This darling turtle dove!All maidens are so neat,So civil, so discreetLet them their charms set loose,And turn your love to use;The gentle bird behold,--She's brought here to be sold.

ííííTheir praises we won't tell;They'll stand inspection well.They're fond of what is new,--And yet, to show they're true,Nor seal nor letter's wanted;To all have wings been granted.The pretty birds behold,--Such beauties ne'er were sold!

íííí1795.-----THE MISANTHROPE.

ííííAT first awhile sits he,

ííííWith calm, unruffled brow;His features then I see,Distorted hideously,--

ííííAn owl's they might be now.

ííííWhat is it, askest thou?Is't love, or is't ennui?

íííí'Tis both at once, I vow.

íííí1767-9.-----DIFFERENT THREATS.

ííííI ONCE into a forest far

ííííMy maiden went to seek,And fell upon her neck, when: ""Ah!""

ííííShe threaten'd, ""I will shriek!""

ííííThen cried I haughtily: ""I'll crush

ííííThe man that dares come near thee!""""Hush!"" whisper'd she: ""My loved one, hush!

ííííOr else they'll overhear thee!""

íííí1767-9.-----MAIDEN WISHES.

ííííWHAT pleasure to meA bridegroom would be!When married we are,They call us mamma.No need then to sew,To school we ne'er go;Command uncontroll'd,Have maids, whom to scold;Choose clothes at our ease,Of what tradesmen we please;Walk freely about,And go to each rout,And unrestrained areBy papa or mamma.

íííí1767-9.-----MOTIVES.

ííííIF to a girl who loves us trulyHer mother gives instruction dulyIn virtue, duty, and what not,--And if she hearkens ne'er a jot,But with fresh-strengthen'd longing flies

ííííTo meet our kiss that seems to burn,--

ííííCaprice has just as much concernedAs love in her bold enterprise.

ííííBut if her mother can succeedIn gaining for her maxims heed,And softening the girl's heart too,So that she coyly shuns our view,--The heart of youth she knows but ill;

ííííFor when a maiden is thus stern,

ííííVirtue in truth has less concernIn this, than an inconstant will.

íííí1767-9.-----TRUE ENJOYMENT.

ííííVAINLY wouldst thou, to gain a heart,

ííííHeap up a maiden's lap with gold;The joys of love thou must impart,

ííííWouldst thou e'er see those joys unfold.The voices of the throng gold buys,

ííííNo single heart 'twill win for thee;Wouldst thou a maiden make thy prize,

ííííThyself alone the bribe must be.

ííííIf by no sacred tie thou'rt bound,

ííííOh youth, thou must thyself restrain!Well may true liberty be found,

ííííTho' man may seem to wear a chain.Let one alone inflame thee e'er,

ííííAnd if her heart with love o'erflows,Let tenderness unite you there,

ííííIf duty's self no fetter knows.

ííííFirst feel, oh youth! A girl then find

ííííWorthy thy choice,--let her choose thee,In body fair, and fair in mind,

ííííAnd then thou wilt be blessed, like me.I who have made this art mine own,

ííííA girl have chosen such as thisThe blessing of the priest alone

ííííIs wanting to complete our bliss.

ííííNought but my rapture is her guide,

ííííOnly for me she cares to please,--Ne'er wanton save when by my side,

ííííAnd modest when the world she sees;That time our glow may never chill,

ííííShe yields no right through frailty;Her favour is a favour still,

ííííAnd I must ever grateful be.

ííííYet I'm content, and full of joy,

ííííIf she'll but grant her smile so sweet,Or if at table she'll employ,

ííííTo pillow hers, her lover's feet,Give me the apple that she bit,

ííííThe glass from which she drank, bestow,And when my kiss so orders it,

ííííHer bosom, veil'd till then, will show.

ííííAnd when she wills of love to speak,

ííííIn fond and silent hours of bliss,Words from her mouth are all I seek,

ííííNought else I crave,--not e'en a kiss.With what a soul her mind is fraught,

ííííWreath'd round with charms unceasingly!She's perfect,--and she fails in nought

ííííSave in her deigning to love me.

ííííMy rev'rence throws me at her feet,

ííííMy longing throws me on her breast;This, youth, is rapture true and sweet,

ííííBe wise, thus seeking to be blest.When death shall take thee from her side,

ííííTo join the angelic choir above,In heaven's bright mansions to abide,--No diff'rence at the change thoult prove.

íííí1767-8.-----THE FAREWELL.

íííí[Probably addressed to his mistress Frederica.]

ííííLET mine eye the farewell say,

ííííThat my lips can utter ne'er;Fain I'd be a man to-day,

ííííYet 'tis hard, oh, hard to bear!

ííííMournful in an hour like this

ííííIs love's sweetest pledge, I ween;Cold upon thy mouth the kiss,

ííííFaint thy fingers' pressure e'en.

ííííOh what rapture to my heart

ííííUsed each stolen kiss to bring!As the violets joy impart,

ííííGather'd in the early spring.

ííííNow no garlands I entwine,

ííííNow no roses pluck. for thee,Though 'tis springtime, Fanny mine,

ííííDreary autumn 'tis to me!

íííí1771.-----THE BEAUTIFUL NIGHT.

ííííNow I leave this cottage lowly,

ííííWhere my love hath made her home,And with silent footstep slowly

ííííThrough the darksome forest roam,Luna breaks through oaks and bushes,

ííííZephyr hastes her steps to meet,And the waving birch-tree blushes,

ííííScattering round her incense sweet.

ííííGrateful are the cooling breezes

ííííOf this beauteous summer night,Here is felt the charm that pleases,

ííííAnd that gives the soul delight.Boundless is my joy; yet, Heaven,

ííííWillingly I'd leave to theeThousand such nights, were one given

ííííBy my maiden loved to me!

íííí1767-8.-----HAPPINESS AND VISION.

ííííTOGETHER at the altar weIn vision oft were seen by thee,

ííííThyself as bride, as bridegroom I.Oft from thy mouth full many a kissIn an unguarded hour of bliss

ííííI then would steal, while none were by.

ííííThe purest rapture we then knew,The joy those happy hours gave too,

ííííWhen tasted, fled, as time fleets on.What now avails my joy to me?Like dreams the warmest kisses flee,

ííííLike kisses, soon all joys are gone.

íííí1767-8.-----LIVING REMEMBRANCE.

ííííHALF vex'd, half pleased, thy love will feel,Shouldst thou her knot or ribbon steal;To thee they're much--I won't conceal;

ííííSuch self-deceit may pardon'd be;A veil, a kerchief, garter, rings,In truth are no mean trifling things,

ííííBut still they're not enough for me.

ííííShe who is dearest to my heart,Gave me, with well dissembled smart,Of her own life, a living part,

ííííNo charm in aught beside I trace;How do I scorn thy paltry ware!A lock she gave me of the hair

ííííThat wantons o'er her beauteous face.

ííííIf, loved one, we must sever'd be,Wouldst thou not wholly fly from me,I still possess this legacy,

ííííTo look at, and to kiss in play.--My fate is to the hair's allied,We used to woo her with like pride,

ííííAnd now we both are far away.

ííííHer charms with equal joy we press'd,Her swelling cheeks anon caress'd,Lured onward by a yearning blest,

ííííUpon her heaving bosom fell.Oh rival, free from envy's sway,Thou precious gift, thou beauteous prey.

ííííRemain my joy and bliss to tell!

íííí1767-9.-----THE BLISS OF ABSENCE.

ííííDRINK, oh youth, joy's purest rayFrom thy loved one's eyes all day,

ííííAnd her image paint at night!Better rule no lover knows,Yet true rapture greater grows,

ííííWhen far sever'd from her sight.

ííííPowers eternal, distance, time,Like the might of stars sublime,

ííííGently rock the blood to rest,O'er my senses softness steals,Yet my bosom lighter feels,

ííííAnd I daily am more blest.

ííííThough I can forget her ne'er,Yet my mind is free from care,

ííííI can calmly live and move;Unperceived infatuationLonging turns to adoration,

ííííTurns to reverence my love.

ííííNe'er can cloud, however light,Float in ether's regions bright,

ííííWhen drawn upwards by the sun,As my heart in rapturous calm.Free from envy and alarm,

ííííEver love I her alone!

íííí1767-9.-----TO LUNA.

ííííSISTER of the first-born light,

ííííType of sorrowing gentleness!

ííííQuivering mists in silv'ry dressFloat around thy features bright;When thy gentle foot is heard,

ííííFrom the day-closed caverns then

ííííWake the mournful ghosts of men,I, too, wake, and each night-bird.

ííííO'er a field of boundless span

ííííLooks thy gaze both far and wide.

ííííRaise me upwards to thy side!Grant this to a raving man!And to heights of rapture raised,

ííííLet the knight so crafty peep

ííííAt his maiden while asleep,Through her lattice-window glazed.

ííííSoon the bliss of this sweet view,

ííííPangs by distance caused allays;

ííííAnd I gather all thy rays,And my look I sharpen too.Round her unveil'd limbs I see

ííííBrighter still become the glow,

ííííAnd she draws me down below,As Endymion once drew thee.

íííí1767-9.-----THE WEDDING NIGHT.

ííííWITHIN the chamber, far away

ííííFrom the glad feast, sits Love in dreadLest guests disturb, in wanton play,

ííííThe silence of the bridal bed.His torch's pale flame serves to gild

ííííThe scene with mystic sacred glow;The room with incense-clouds is fil'd,

ííííThat ye may perfect rapture know.

ííííHow beats thy heart, when thou dost hear

ííííThe chime that warns thy guests to fly!How glow'st thou for those lips so dear,

ííííThat soon are mute, and nought deny!With her into the holy place

ííííThou hast'nest then, to perfect all;The fire the warder's hands embrace,

ííííGrows, like a night-light, dim and small.

ííííHow heaves her bosom, and how burns

ííííHer face at every fervent kiss!Her coldness now to trembling turns,

ííííThy daring now a duty is.Love helps thee to undress her fast,

ííííBut thou art twice as fast as he;And then he shuts both eye at last,

ííííWith sly and roguish modesty.

íííí1767.-----MISCHIEVOUS JOY.

ííííAS a butterfly renew'd,

ííííWhen in life I breath'd my last,

ííííTo the spots my flight I wing,

ííííScenes of heav'nly rapture past,

ííííOver meadows, to the spring,Round the hill, and through the wood.

ííííSoon a tender pair I spy,

ííííAnd I look down from my seat

ííííOn the beauteous maiden's head--

ííííWhen embodied there I meet

ííííAll I lost as soon as dead,Happy as before am I.

ííííHim she clasps with silent smile,

ííííAnd his mouth the hour improves,

ííííSent by kindly Deities;

ííííFirst from breast to mouth it roves,

ííííThen from mouth to hands it flies,And I round him sport the while.

ííííAnd she sees me hov'ring near;

ííííTrembling at her lovers rapture,

ííííUp she springs--I fly away,

íííí""Dearest! let's the insect capture

ííííCome! I long to make my preyYonder pretty little dear!""

íííí1767-9.-----APPARENT DEATH.

ííííWEEP, maiden, weep here o'er the tomb of Love;

ííííHe died of nothing--by mere chance was slain.But is he really dead?--oh, that I cannot prove:

ííííA nothing, a mere chance, oft gives him life again.

íííí1767-9.-----NOVEMBER SONG.

ííííTo the great archer--not to him

ííííTo meet whom flies the sun,And who is wont his features dim

ííííWith clouds to overrun--

ííííBut to the boy be vow'd these rhymes,

ííííWho 'mongst the roses plays,Who hear us, and at proper times

ííííTo pierce fair hearts essays.

ííííThrough him the gloomy winter night,

ííííOf yore so cold and drear,Brings many a loved friend to our sight,

ííííAnd many a woman dear.

ííííHenceforward shall his image fair

ííííStand in yon starry skies,And, ever mild and gracious there,

ííííAlternate set and rise.

íííí1815.*-----TO THE CHOSEN ONE.[This sweet song is doubtless one of those addressed toFrederica.]

ííííHAND in hand! and lip to lip!

ííííOh, be faithful, maiden dear!Fare thee well! thy lover's ship

ííííPast full many a rock must steersBut should he the haven see,

ííííWhen the storm has ceased to break,And be happy, reft of thee,--

ííííMay the Gods fierce vengeance take!

ííííBoldly dared is well nigh won!

ííííHalf my task is solved aright;Ev'ry star's to me a sun,

ííííOnly cowards deem it night.Stood I idly by thy side,

ííííSorrow still would sadden me;But when seas our paths divide,

ííííGladly toil I,--toil for thee!

ííííNow the valley I perceive,

ííííWhere together we will go,And the streamlet watch each eve,

ííííGliding peacefully belowOh, the poplars on yon spot!

ííííOh, the beech trees in yon grove!And behind we'll build a cot,

ííííWhere to taste the joys of love!

íííí1771.-----FIRST LOSS.

ííííAH! who'll e'er those days restore,

ííííThose bright days of early loveWho'll one hour again concede,

ííííOf that time so fondly cherish'd!Silently my wounds I feed,And with wailing evermore

ííííSorrow o'er each joy now perish'd.Ah! who'll e'er the days restore

ííííOf that time so fondly cherish'd.

íííí1789.*-----AFTER-SENSATIONS.

ííííWHEN the vine again is blowing,

ííííThen the wine moves in the cask;When the rose again is glowing,

ííííWherefore should I feel oppress'd?

ííííDown my cheeks run tears all-burning,

ííííIf I do, or leave my task;I but feel a speechless yearning,

ííííThat pervades my inmost breast.

ííííBut at length I see the reason,

ííííWhen the question I would ask:'Twas in such a beauteous season,

ííííDoris glowed to make me blest!

íííí1797.-----PROXIMITY OF THE BELOVED ONE.

ííííI THINK of thee, whene'er the sun his beams

ííííO'er ocean flings;I think  of thee, whene'er the moonlight gleams

ííííIn silv'ry springs.

ííííI see thee, when upon the distant ridge

ííííThe dust awakes;At midnight's hour, when on the fragile bridge

ííííThe wanderer quakes.

ííííI hear thee, when yon billows rise on high,

ííííWith murmur deep.To tread the silent grove oft wander I,

ííííWhen all's asleep.

ííííI'm near thee, though thou far away mayst be--

ííííThou, too, art near!The sun then sets, the stars soon lighten me.

ííííWould thou wert here!

íííí1795.-----PRESENCE.

ííííALL things give token of thee!As soon as the bright sun is shining,Thou too wilt follow, I trust.

ííííWhen in the garden thou walk'st,Thou then art the rose of all roses,Lily of lilies as well.

ííííWhen thou dost move in the dance,Then each constellation moves also;With thee and round thee they move.

ííííNight! oh, what bliss were the night!For then thou o'ershadow'st the lustre,Dazzling and fair, of the moon.

ííííDazzling and beauteous art thou,And flowers, and moon, and the planetsHomage pay, Sun, but to thee.

ííííSun! to me also be thouCreator of days bright and glorious;Life and Eternity this!

íííí1813.-----TO THE DISTANT ONE.

ííííAND have I lost thee evermore?

ííííHast thou, oh fair one, from me flown?Still in mine ear sounds, as of yore,

ííííThine ev'ry word, thine ev'ry tone.

ííííAs when at morn the wand'rer's eye

ííííAttempts to pierce the air in vain,When, hidden in the azure sky,

ííííThe lark high o'er him chaunts his strain:

ííííSo do I cast my troubled gaze

ííííThrough bush, through forest, o'er the lea;Thou art invoked by all my lays;

ííííOh, come then, loved one, back to me!

íííí1789.*-----BY THE RIVER.

ííííFLOW on, ye lays so loved, so fair,

ííííOn to Oblivion's ocean flow!May no rapt boy recall you e'er,

ííííNo maiden in her beauty's glow!

ííííMy love alone was then your theme,

ííííBut now she scorns my passion true.Ye were but written in the stream;

ííííAs it flows on, then, flow ye too!

íííí1798.*-----FAREWELL.

ííííTo break one's word is pleasure-fraught,

ííííTo do one's duty gives a smart;While man, alas! will promise nought,

ííííThat is repugnant to his heart.

ííííUsing some magic strains of yore,

ííííThou lurest him, when scarcely calm,On to sweet folly's fragile bark once more,

ííííRenewing, doubling chance of harm.

ííííWhy seek to hide thyself from me?

ííííFly not my sight--be open then!Known late or early it must be,

ííííAnd here thou hast thy word again.

ííííMy duty is fulfill'd to-day,

ííííNo longer will I guard thee from surprise;But, oh, forgive the friend who from thee turns away,

ííííAnd to himself for refuge flies!

íííí1797.-----THE EXCHANGE.

ííííTHE stones in the streamlet I make my bright pillow,And open my arms to the swift-rolling billow,

ííííThat lovingly hastens to fall on my breast.Then fickleness soon bids it onwards be flowing;A second draws nigh, its caresses bestowing,--

ííííAnd so by a twofold enjoyment I'm blest.

ííííAnd yet thou art trailing in sorrow and sadnessThe moments that life, as it flies, gave for gladness,

ííííBecause by thy love thou'rt remember'd no more!Oh, call back to mind former days and their blisses!The lips of the second will give as sweet kisses

ííííAs any the lips of the first gave before!

íííí1767-9.-----WELCOME AND FAREWELL.

íííí[Another of the love-songs addressed to Frederica.]

ííííQUICK throbb'd my heart: to norse! haste, haste,

ííííAnd lo! 'twas done with speed of light;The evening soon the world embraced,

ííííAnd o'er the mountains hung the night.Soon stood, in robe of mist, the oak,

ííííA tow'ring giant in his size,Where darkness through the thicket broke,

ííííAnd glared with hundred gloomy eyes.

ííííFrom out a hill of clouds the moon

ííííWith mournful gaze began to peer:The winds their soft wings flutter'd soon,

ííííAnd murmur'd in mine awe-struck ear;The night a thousand monsters made,

ííííYet fresh and joyous was my mind;What fire within my veins then play'd!

ííííWhat glow was in my bosom shrin'd!

ííííI saw thee, and with tender pride

ííííFelt thy sweet gaze pour joy on me;While all my heart was at thy side.

ííííAnd every breath I breath'd for thee.The roseate hues that spring supplies

ííííWere playing round thy features fair,And love for me--ye Deities!

ííííI hoped it, I deserved it ne'er!

ííííBut, when the morning sun return'd,

ííííDeparture filled with grief my heart:Within thy kiss, what rapture burn'd!

ííííBut in thy look, what bitter smart!I went--thy gaze to earth first roved

ííííThou follow'dst me with tearful eye:And yet, what rapture to be loved!

ííííAnd, Gods, to love--what ecstasy!

íííí1771.-----NEW LOVE, NEW LIFE.

íííí[Written at the time of Goethe's connection with Lily.]

ííííHEART! my heart! what means this feeling?

ííííWhat oppresseth thee so sore?What strange life is o'er me stealing!

ííííI acknowledge thee no more.Fled is all that gave thee gladness,Fled the cause of all thy sadness,

ííííFled thy peace, thine industry--

ííííAh, why suffer it to be?

ííííSay, do beauty's graces youthful,

ííííDoes this form so fair and bright,Does this gaze, so kind, so truthful,

ííííChain thee with unceasing might?Would I tear me from her boldly,Courage take, and fly her coldly,

ííííBack to her. I'm forthwith led

ííííBy the path I seek to tread.

ííííBy a thread I ne'er can sever,

ííííFor 'tis 'twined with magic skill,Doth the cruel maid for ever

ííííHold me fast against my will.While those magic chains confine me,To her will I must resign me.

ííííAh, the change in truth is great!

ííííLove! kind love! release me straight!

íííí1775.-----TO BELINDA.

íííí[This song was also written for Lily. Goethe mentions, at the endof his Autobiography, that he overheard her singing it oneevening after he had taken his last farewell of her.]

ííííWHEREFORE drag me to yon glittering eddy,

ííííWith resistless might?Was I, then, not truly blest already

ííííIn the silent night?

ííííIn my secret chamber refuge taking,

íííí'Neath the moon's soft ray,And her awful light around me breaking,

ííííMusing there I lay.

ííííAnd I dream'd of hours with joy o'erflowing,

ííííGolden, truly blest,While thine image so beloved was glowing

ííííDeep within my breast.

ííííNow to the card-table hast thou bound me,

íííí'Midst the torches glare?Whilst unhappy faces are around me,

ííííDost thou hold me there?

ííííSpring-flow'rs are to me more rapture-giving,

ííííNow conceal'd from view;Where thou, angel, art, is Nature living,

ííííLove and kindness too.

íííí1775.-----MAY SONG.

ííííHow fair doth Nature

ííííAppear again!How bright the sunbeams!

ííííHow smiles the plain!

ííííThe flow'rs are bursting

ííííFrom ev'ry bough,And thousand voices

ííííEach bush yields now.

ííííAnd joy and gladness

ííííFill ev'ry breast!Oh earth!--oh sunlight!

ííííOh rapture blest!

ííííOh love! oh loved one!

ííííAs golden bright,As clouds of morning

ííííOn yonder height!

ííííThou blessest gladly

ííííThe smiling field,--The world in fragrant

ííííVapour conceal'd.

ííííOh maiden, maiden,

ííííHow love I thee!Thine eye, how gleams it!

ííííHow lov'st thou me!

ííííThe blithe lark loveth

ííííSweet song and air,The morning flow'ret

ííííHeav'n's incense fair,

ííííAs I now love thee

ííííWith fond desire,For thou dost give me

ííííYouth, joy, and fire,

ííííFor new-born dances

ííííAnd minstrelsy.Be ever happy,

ííííAs thou lov'st me!

íííí1775.*-----WITH A PAINTED RIBBON.

ííííLITTLE leaves and flow'rets too,

ííííScatter we with gentle hand,Kind young spring-gods to the view,

ííííSporting on an airy band.

ííííZephyr, bear it on the wing,

ííííTwine it round my loved one's dress;To her glass then let her spring,

ííííFull of eager joyousness.

ííííRoses round her let her see,

ííííShe herself a youthful rose.Grant, dear life, one look to me!

íííí'Twill repay me all my woes,

ííííWhat this bosom feels, feel thou.

ííííFreely offer me thy hand;Let the band that joins us now

ííííBe no fragile rosy band!

íííí1770.-----WITH A GOLDEN NECKLACE.

ííííTHIS page a chain to bring thee burns,

ííííThat, train'd to suppleness of old,On thy fair neck to nestle, yearns,

ííííIn many a hundred little fold.

ííííTo please the silly thing consent!

íííí'Tis harmless, and from boldness free;By day a trifling ornament,

ííííAt night 'tis cast aside by thee.

ííííBut if the chain they bring thee ever,

ííííHeavier, more fraught with weal or woe,I'd then, Lisette, reproach thee never

ííííIf thou shouldst greater scruples show.

íííí1775.*-----ON THE LAKE,

íííí[Written on the occasion of Goethe's starting with his friendPassavant on a Swiss Tour.]

ííííI DRINK fresh nourishment, new blood

ííííFrom out this world more free;The Nature is so kind and good

ííííThat to her breast clasps me!The billows toss our bark on high,

ííííAnd with our oars keep time,While cloudy mountains tow'rd the sky

ííííBefore our progress climb.

ííííSay, mine eye, why sink'st thou down?Golden visions, are ye flown?

ííííHence, thou dream, tho' golden-twin'd;

ííííHere, too, love and life I find.

ííííOver the waters are blinking

ííííMany a thousand fair star;Gentle mists are drinking

ííííRound the horizon afar.Round the shady creek lightly

ííííMorning zephyrs awake,And the ripen'd fruit brightly

ííííMirrors itself in the lake.

íííí1775.-----FROM THE MOUNTAIN.

íííí[Written just after the preceding one, on a mountain overlookingthe Lake of Zurich.]

ííííIF I, dearest Lily, did not love thee,

ííííHow this prospect would enchant my sight!And yet if I, Lily, did not love thee,

ííííCould I find, or here, or there, delight?

íííí1775.-----FLOWER-SALUTE.

ííííTHIS nosegay,--'twas I dress'd it,--

ííííGreets thee a thousand times!Oft stoop'd I, and caress'd it,

ííííAh! full a thousand times,And 'gainst my bosom press'd it

ííííA hundred thousand times!

íííí1815.*-----IN SUMMER.

ííííHow plain and heightWith dewdrops are bright!How pearls have crown'dThe plants all around!How sighs the breezeThro' thicket and trees!How loudly in the sun's clear raysThe sweet birds carol forth their lays!

ííííBut, ah! above,Where saw I my love,Within her room,Small, mantled in gloom,Enclosed around,Where sunlight was drown'd,How little there was earth to me,With all its beauteous majesty!

íííí1776.*-----MAY SONG.

ííííBETWEEN wheatfield and corn,Between hedgerow and thorn,Between pasture and tree,Where's my sweetheartTell it me!

ííííSweetheart caught I

ííííNot at home;She's then, thought I.

ííííGone to roam.Fair and loving

ííííBlooms sweet May;Sweetheart's roving,

ííííFree and gay.

ííííBy the rock near the wave,Where her first kiss she gave,On the greensward, to me,--Something I see!Is it she?

íííí1812.-----PREMATURE SPRING.

ííííDAYS full of rapture,

ííííAre ye renew'd ?--Smile in the sunlight

ííííMountain and wood?

ííííStreams richer laden

ííííFlow through the dale,Are these the meadows?

ííííIs this the vale?

ííííCoolness cerulean!

ííííHeaven and height!Fish crowd the ocean,

ííííGolden and bright.

ííííBirds of gay plumage

ííííSport in the grove,Heavenly numbers

ííííSinging above.

ííííUnder the verdure's

ííííVigorous bloom,Bees, softly bumming,

ííííJuices consume.

ííííGentle disturbance

ííííQuivers in air,Sleep-causing fragrance,

ííííMotion so fair.

ííííSoon with more power

ííííRises the breeze,Then in a moment

ííííDies in the trees.

ííííBut to the bosom

ííííComes it again.Aid me, ye Muses,

ííííBliss to sustain!

ííííSay what has happen'd

ííííSince yester e'en?Oh, ye fair sisters,

ííííHer I have seen!

íííí1802.-----AUTUMN FEELINGS.

ííííFLOURISH greener, as ye clamber,Oh ye leaves, to seek my chamber,

ííííUp the trellis'd vine on high!May ye swell, twin-berries tender,Juicier far,--and with more splendour

ííííRipen, and more speedily!O'er ye broods the sun at evenAs he sinks to rest, and heaven

ííííSoftly breathes into your earAll its fertilising fullness,While the moon's refreshing coolness,

ííííMagic-laden, hovers near;And, alas! ye're watered ever

ííííBy a stream of tears that rillFrom mine eyes--tears ceasing never,

ííííTears of love that nought can still!

íííí1775.*-----RESTLESS LOVE.

ííííTHROUGH rain, through snow,Through tempest go!'Mongst streaming caves,O'er misty waves,On, on! still on!Peace, rest have flown!

ííííSooner through sadness

ííííI'd wish to be slain,Than all the gladness

ííííOf life to sustainAll the fond yearning

ííííThat heart feels for heart,Only seems burning

ííííTo make them both smart.

ííííHow shall I fly?Forestwards hie?Vain were all strife!Bright crown of life.Turbulent bliss,--Love, thou art this!

íííí1789.-----THE SHEPHERD'S LAMENT.

ííííON yonder lofty mountain

ííííA thousand times I stand,And on my staff reclining,

ííííLook down on the smiling land.

ííííMy grazing flocks then I follow,

ííííMy dog protecting them well;I find myself in the valley,

ííííBut how, I scarcely can tell.

ííííThe whole of the meadow is cover'd

ííííWith flowers of beauty rare;I pluck them, but pluck them unknowing

ííííTo whom the offering to bear.

ííííIn rain and storm and tempest,

ííííI tarry beneath the tree,But closed remaineth yon portal;

íííí'Tis all but a vision to me.

ííííHigh over yonder dwelling,

ííííThere rises a rainbow gay;But she from home hath departed

ííííAnd wander'd far, far away.

ííííYes, far away bath she wander'd,

ííííPerchance e'en over the sea;Move onward, ye sheep, then, move onward!

ííííFull sad the shepherd must be.

íííí1803.*-----COMFORT IN TEARS.

ííííHow happens it that thou art sad,

ííííWhile happy all appear?Thine eye proclaims too well that thou

ííííHast wept full many a tear.

íííí""If I have wept in solitude,

ííííNone other shares my grief,And tears to me sweet balsam are,

ííííAnd give my heart relief.""

ííííThy happy friends invite thee now,--

ííííOh come, then, to our breast!And let the loss thou hast sustain'd

ííííBe there to us confess'd!

íííí""Ye shout, torment me, knowing not

ííííWhat 'tis afflicteth me;Ah no! I have sustained no loss,

ííííWhate'er may wanting be.""

ííííIf so it is, arise in haste!

ííííThou'rt young and full of life.At years like thine, man's blest with strength.

ííííAnd courage for the strife.

íííí""Ah no! in vain 'twould be to strive,

ííííThe thing I seek is far;It dwells as high, it gleams as fair

ííííAs yonder glitt'ring star.""

ííííThe stars we never long to clasp,

ííííWe revel in their light,And with enchantment upward gaze,

ííííEach clear and radiant night.

íííí""And I with rapture upward gaze,

ííííOn many a blissful day;Then let me pass the night in tears,

ííííTill tears are wip'd away!

íííí1803.*-----NIGHT SONG,

ííííWHEN on thy pillow lying,

ííííHalf listen, I implore,And at my lute's soft sighing,

ííííSleep on! what wouldst thou more?

ííííFor at my lute's soft sighing

ííííThe stars their blessings pourOn feelings never-dying;

ííííSleep on! what wouldst thou more?

ííííThose feelings never-dying

ííííMy spirit aid to soarFrom earthly conflicts trying;

ííííSleep on! what wouldst thou more?

ííííFrom earthly conflicts trying

ííííThou driv'st me to this shore;Through thee I'm thither flying,--

ííííSleep on! what wouldst thou more?

ííííThrough thee I'm hither flying,

ííííThou wilt not list beforeIn slumbers thou art lying:

ííííSleep on! what wouldst thou more?

íííí1803.*-----LONGING.

ííííWHAT pulls at my heart so?

ííííWhat tells me to roam?What drags me and lures me

ííííFrom chamber and home?How round the cliffs gather

ííííThe clouds high in air!I fain would go thither,

ííííI fain would be there!

ííííThe sociable flight

ííííOf the ravens comes back;I mingle amongst them,

ííííAnd follow their track.Round wall and round mountain

ííííTogether we fly;She tarries below there,

ííííI after her spy.

ííííThen onward she wanders,

ííííMy flight I wing soonTo the wood fill'd with bushes,

ííííA bird of sweet tune.She tarries and hearkens,

ííííAnd smiling, thinks she:""How sweetly he's singing!

ííííHe's singing to me!""

ííííThe heights are illum'd

ííííBy the fast setting sun;The pensive fair maiden

ííííLooks thoughtfully on;She roams by the streamlet,

ííííO'er meadows she goes,And darker and darker

ííííThe pathway fast grows.

ííííI rise on a sudden,

ííííA glimmering star;""What glitters above me,

ííííSo near and so far?""

ííííAnd when thou with wonder

ííííHast gazed on the light,I fall down before thee,

ííííEntranced by thy sight!

íííí1803.-----TO MIGNON.

ííííOVER vale and torrent farRolls along the sun's bright car.Ah! he wakens in his course

ííííMine, as thy deep-seated smart

ííííIn the heart.Ev'ry morning with new force.

ííííScarce avails night aught to me;E'en the visions that I seeCome but in a mournful guise;

ííííAnd I feel this silent smart

ííííIn my heartWith creative pow'r arise.

ííííDuring many a beauteous yearI have seen ships 'neath me steer,As they seek the shelt'ring bay;

ííííBut, alas, each lasting smart

ííííIn my heartFloats not with the stream away.

ííííI must wear a gala dress,Long stored up within my press,For to-day to feasts is given;

ííííNone know with what bitter smart

ííííIs my heartFearfully and madly riven.

ííííSecretly I weep each tear,Yet can cheerful e'en appear,With a face of healthy red;

ííííFor if deadly were this silent smart

ííííIn my heart,Ah, I then had long been dead!-----THE MOUNTAIN CASTLE.

ííííTHERE stands on yonder high mountain

ííííA castle built of yore,Where once lurked horse and horseman

ííííIn rear of gate and of door.

ííííNow door and gate are in ashes,

ííííAnd all around is so still;And over the fallen ruins

ííííI clamber just as I will.

ííííBelow once lay a cellar,

ííííWith costly wines well stor'd;No more the glad maid with her pitcher

ííííDescends there to draw from the hoard.

ííííNo longer the goblet she places

ííííBefore the guests at the feast;The flask at the meal so hallow'd

ííííNo longer she fills for the priest.

ííííNo more for the eager squire

ííííThe draught in the passage is pour'd;No more for the flying present

ííííReceives she the flying reward.

ííííFor all the roof and the rafters,

ííííThey all long since have been burn'd,And stairs and passage and chapel

ííííTo rubbish and ruins are turn'd.

ííííYet when with lute and with flagon,

ííííWhen day was smiling and bright,I've watch'd my mistress climbing

ííííTo gain this perilous height,

ííííThen rapture joyous and radiant

ííííThe silence so desolate brake,And all, as in days long vanish'd,

ííííOnce more to enjoyment awoke;

ííííAs if for guests of high station

ííííThe largest rooms were prepared;As if from those times so precious

ííííA couple thither had fared;

ííííAs if there stood in his chapel

ííííThe priest in his sacred dress,And ask'd: ""Would ye twain be united?""

ííííAnd we, with a smile, answer'd, ""Yes!""

ííííAnd songs that breath'd a deep feeling,

ííííThat touched the heart's innermost chord,The music-fraught mouth of sweet echo,

ííííInstead of the many, outpour'd.

ííííAnd when at eve all was hidden

ííííIn silence unbroken and deep,The glowing sun then look'd upwards,

ííííAnd gazed on the summit so steep.

ííííAnd squire and maiden then glitter'd

ííííAs bright and gay as a lord,She seized the time for her present,

ííííAnd he to give her reward.

íííí1803.*-----THE SPIRIT'S SALUTE.

ííííTHE hero's noble shade stands high

ííííOn yonder turret grey;And as the ship is sailing by,

ííííHe speeds it on his way.

íííí""See with what strength these sinews thrill'd!

ííííThis heart, how firm and wild!These bones, what knightly marrow fill'd!

ííííThis cup, how bright it smil'd!

íííí""Half of my life I strove and fought,

ííííAnd half I calmly pass'd;And thou, oh ship with beings fraught,

ííííSail safely to the last!""

íííí1774.-----TO A GOLDEN HEART THAT HE WORE ROUND HIS NECK.

íííí[Addressed, during the Swiss tour already mentioned, to a presentLily had given him, during the time of their happy connection,which was then about to be terminated for ever.]

ííííOH thou token loved of joys now perish'd

ííííThat I still wear from my neck suspended,Art thou stronger than our spirit-bond so cherish'd?

ííííOr canst thou prolong love's days untimely ended?

ííííLily, I fly from thee! I still am doom'd to rangeThro' countries strange,

ííííThro' distant vales and woods, link'd on to thee!Ah, Lily's heart could surely never fall

ííííSo soon away from me!

ííííAs when a bird bath broken from his thrall,

ííííAnd seeks the forest green,Proof of imprisonment he bears behind him,A morsel of the thread once used to bind him;

ííííThe free-born bird of old no more is seen,

ííííFor he another's prey bath been.

íííí1775.-----THE BLISS OF SORROW.

ííííNEVER dry, never dry,

ííííTears that eternal love sheddeth!How dreary, how dead doth the world still appear,When only half-dried on the eye is the tear!

ííííNever dry, never dry,

ííííTears that unhappy love sheddeth!

íííí1789.*-----THE WANDERER'S NIGHT-SONG.

ííííTHOU who comest from on high,

ííííWho all woes and sorrows stillest,Who, for twofold misery,

ííííHearts with twofold balsam fillest,Would this constant strife would cease!

ííííWhat are pain and rapture now?Blissful Peace,

ííííTo my bosom hasten thou!

íííí1789.*-----THE SAME.

íííí[Written at night on the Kickelhahn, a hill in the forest ofIlmenau, on the walls of a little hermitage where Goethe composedthe last act of his Iphigenia.]

ííííHUSH'D on the hill

ííííIs the breeze;

ííííScarce by the zephyr

ííííThe trees

ííííSoftly are press'd;The woodbird's asleep on the bough.Wait, then, and thou

ííííSoon wilt find rest.

íííí1783.-----THE HUNTER'S EVEN-SONG.

ííííTHE plain with still and wand'ring feet,

ííííAnd gun full-charged, I tread,And hov'ring see thine image sweet,

ííííThine image dear, o'er head.

ííííIn gentle silence thou dost fare

ííííThrough field and valley dear;But doth my fleeting image ne'er

ííííTo thy mind's eye appear?

ííííHis image, who, by grief oppress'd,

ííííRoams through the world forlorn,And wanders on from east to west,

ííííBecause from thee he's torn?

ííííWhen I would think of none but thee,

ííííMine eyes the moon survey;A calm repose then steals o'er me,

ííííBut how, 'twere hard to say.

íííí1776,*-----TO THE MOON.

ííííBUSH and vale thou fill'st again

ííííWith thy misty ray,And my spirit's heavy chain

ííííCastest far away.

ííííThou dost o'er my fields extend

ííííThy sweet soothing eye,Watching like a gentle friend,

ííííO'er my destiny.

ííííVanish'd days of bliss and woe

ííííHaunt me with their tone,Joy and grief in turns I know,

ííííAs I stray alone.

ííííStream beloved, flow on! flow on!

ííííNe'er can I be gay!Thus have sport and kisses gone,

ííííTruth thus pass'd away.

ííííOnce I seem'd the lord to be

ííííOf that prize so fair!Now, to our deep sorrow, we

ííííCan forget it ne'er.

ííííMurmur, stream, the vale along,

ííííNever cease thy sighs;Murmur, whisper to my song

ííííAnswering melodies!

ííííWhen thou in the winter's night

ííííOverflow'st in wrath,Or in spring-time sparklest bright,

ííííAs the buds shoot forth.

ííííHe who from the world retires,

ííííVoid of hate, is blest;Who a friend's true love inspires,

ííííLeaning on his breast!

ííííThat which heedless man ne'er knew,

ííííOr ne'er thought aright,Roams the bosom's labyrinth through,

ííííBoldly into night.

íííí1789.*-----TO LINA.

ííííSHOULD these songs, love, as they fleet,

ííííChance again to reach thy hand,At the piano take thy seat,

ííííWhere thy friend was wont to stand!

ííííSweep with finger bold the string,

ííííThen the book one moment see:But read not! do nought but sing!

ííííAnd each page thine own will be!

ííííAh, what grief the song imparts

ííííWith its letters, black on white,That, when breath'd by thee, our hearts

ííííNow can break and now delight!

íííí1800.*-----EVER AND EVERYWHERE.

ííííFAR explore the mountain hollow,High in air the clouds then follow!

ííííTo each brook and vale the Muse

ííííThousand times her call renews.

ííííSoon as a flow'ret blooms in spring,It wakens many a strain;

ííííAnd when Time spreads his fleeting wing,

ííííThe seasons come again.

íííí1820.*-----PETITION.

ííííOH thou sweet maiden fair,Thou with the raven hair,

ííííWhy to the window go?

ííííWhile gazing down below,Art standing vainly there?

ííííOh, if thou stood'st for me,And lett'st the latch but fly,

ííííHow happy should I be!How soon would I leap high!

íííí1789.*-----TO HIS COY ONE.

ííííSEEST thou yon smiling Orange?Upon the tree still hangs it;Already March bath vanish'd,And new-born flow'rs are shooting.I draw nigh to the tree then,And there I say: Oh Orange,Thou ripe and juicy Orange,Thou sweet and luscious Orange,I shake the tree, I shake it,Oh fall into my lap!

íííí1789.*-----NIGHT THOUGHTS.

ííííOH, unhappy stars! your fate I mourn,

ííííYe by whom the sea-toss'd sailor's lighted,Who with radiant beams the heav'ns adorn,

ííííBut by gods and men are unrequited:For ye love not,--ne'er have learnt to love!Ceaselessly in endless dance ye move,In the spacious sky your charms displaying,

ííííWhat far travels ye have hasten'd through,Since, within my loved one's arms delaying,

ííííI've forgotten you and midnight too!

íííí1789.*-----TO LIDA.

ííííTHE only one whom, Lida, thou canst love,

ííííThou claim'st, and rightly claim'st, for only thee;He too is wholly thine; since doomed to rove

ííííFar from thee, in life's turmoils nought I seeSave a thin veil, through which thy form I view,As though in clouds; with kindly smile and true,

ííííIt cheers me, like the stars eterne that gleamAcross the northern-lights' far-flick'ring beam.

íííí1789.*-----PROXIMITY.

ííííI KNOW not, wherefore, dearest love,

ííííThou often art so strange and coyWhen 'mongst man's busy haunts we move,

ííííThy coldness puts to flight my joy.But soon as night and silence round us reign,I know thee by thy kisses sweet again!

íííí1789.*-----RECIPROCAL.

ííííMY mistress, where sits she?

ííííWhat is it that charms?The absent she's rocking,

ííííHeld fast in her arms.

ííííIn pretty cage prison'd

ííííShe holds a bird still;Yet lets him fly from her,

ííííWhenever he will.

ííííHe pecks at her finger,

ííííAnd pecks at her lips,And hovers and flutters,

ííííAnd round her he skips.

ííííThen hasten thou homeward,

ííííIn fashion to be;If thou hast the maiden,

ííííShe also hath thee.

íííí1816.-----ROLLICKING HANS.

ííííHALLO there! A glass!

ííííHa! the draught's truly sweet!If for drink go my shoes,

ííííI shall still have my feet.

ííííA maiden and wine,

ííííWith sweet music and song,--I would they were mine,

ííííAll life's journey along!

ííííIf I depart from this sad sphere,And leave a will behind me here,A suit at law will be preferr'd,But as for thanks,--the deuce a word!So ere I die, I squander all,And that a proper will I call.

ííííHIS COMRADE.

ííííHallo there! A glass!

ííííHa! the draught's truly sweetIf thou keepest thy shoes,

ííííThou wilt then spare thy feet.

ííííA maiden and wine,

ííííWith sweet music and song,On pavement, are thine,

ííííAll life's journey along!-----THE FREEBOOTER,

ííííNo door has my house,

ííííNo house has my door;And in and out ever

ííííI carry my store.

ííííNo grate has my kitchen,

ííííNo kitchen my grate;Yet roasts it and boils it

ííííBoth early and late.

ííííMy bed has no trestles,

ííííMy trestles no bed;Yet merrier moments

ííííNo mortal e'er led.

ííííMy cellar is lofty,

ííííMy barn is full deep,From top to the bottom,--

ííííThere lie I and sleep.

ííííAnd soon as I waken,

ííííAll moves on its race;My place has no fixture,

ííííMy fixture no place.

íííí1827.*-----JOY AND SORROW.

ííííAs a fisher-boy I fared

ííííTo the black rock in the sea,And, while false gifts I prepared.

ííííListen'd and sang merrily,Down descended the decoy,

ííííSoon a fish attack'd the bait;One exultant shout of joy,--

ííííAnd the fish was captured straight.

ííííAh! on shore, and to the wood

ííííPast the cliffs, o'er stock and stone,One foot's traces I pursued,

ííííAnd the maiden was alone.Lips were silent, eyes downcast

ííííAs a clasp-knife snaps the bait,With her snare she seized me fast,

ííííAnd the boy was captured straight.

ííííHeav'n knows who's the happy swain

ííííThat she rambles with anew!I must dare the sea again,

ííííSpite of wind and weather too.When the great and little fish

ííííWail and flounder in my net,Straight returns my eager wish

ííííIn her arms to revel yet!

íííí1815.-----MARCH.

ííííTHE snow-flakes fall in showers,

ííííThe time is absent still,When all Spring's beauteous flowers,When all Spring's beauteous flowers

ííííOur hearts with joy shall fill.

ííííWith lustre false and fleeting

ííííThe sun's bright rays are thrown;The swallow's self is cheating:The swallow's self is cheating,

ííííAnd why? He comes alone!

ííííCan I e'er feel delighted

ííííAlone, though Spring is near?Yet when we are united,Yet when we are united,

ííííThe Summer will be here.

íííí1817.-----APRIL.

ííííTELL me, eyes, what 'tis ye're seeking;

ííííFor ye're saying something sweet,

ííííFit the ravish'd ear to greet,Eloquently, softly speaking.

ííííYet I see now why ye're roving;

ííííFor behind those eyes so bright,

ííííTo itself abandon'd quite,Lies a bosom, truthful, loving,--

ííííOne that it must fill with pleasure

íííí'Mongst so many, dull and blind,

ííííOne true look at length to find,That its worth can rightly treasure.

ííííWhilst I'm lost in studying ever

ííííTo explain these cyphers duly,--

ííííTo unravel my looks trulyIn return be your endeavour!

íííí1820.-----MAY.

ííííLIGHT and silv'ry cloudlets hover

ííííIn the air, as yet scarce warm;Mild, with glimmer soft tinged over,

ííííPeeps the sun through fragrant balm.Gently rolls and heaves the ocean

ííííAs its waves the bank o'erflow.And with ever restless motion

ííííMoves the verdure to and fro,

ííííMirror'd brightly far below.

ííííWhat is now the foliage moving?

ííííAir is still, and hush'd the breeze,Sultriness, this fullness loving,

ííííThrough the thicket, from the trees.Now the eye at once gleams brightly,

ííííSee! the infant band with mirthMoves and dances nimbly, lightly,

ííííAs the morning gave it birth,

ííííFlutt'ring two and two o'er earth.

íííí*      *      *      *

íííí1816.-----JUNE.

ííííSHE behind yon mountain lives,Who my love's sweet guerdon gives.Tell me, mount, how this can be!Very glass thou seem'st to me,And I seem to be close by,For I see her drawing nigh;Now, because I'm absent, sad,Now, because she sees me, glad!

ííííSoon between us rise to sightValleys cool, with bushes light,Streams and meadows; next appear

ííííMills and wheels, the surest tokenThat a level spot is near,

ííííPlains far-stretching and unbroken.And so onwards, onwards roam,To my garden and my home!

ííííBut how comes it then to pass?All this gives no joy, alas!--I was ravish'd by her sight,By her eyes so fair and bright,By her footstep soft and light.How her peerless charms I praised,When from head to foot I gazed!I am here, she's far away,--I am gone, with her to stay.

ííííIf on rugged hills she wander,

ííííIf she haste the vale along,Pinions seem to flutter yonder,

ííííAnd the air is fill'd with song;With the glow of youth still playing,

ííííJoyous vigour in each limb,One in silence is delaying,

ííííShe alone 'tis blesses him.

ííííLove, thou art too fair, I ween!Fairer I have never seen!From the heart full easilyBlooming flowers are cull'd by thee.If I think: ""Oh, were it so,""Bone and marrow seen to glow!If rewarded by her love,Can I greater rapture prove?

ííííAnd still fairer is the bride,When in me she will confide,When she speaks and lets me knowAll her tale of joy and woe.All her lifetime's historyNow is fully known to me.Who in child or woman e'erSoul and body found so fair?

íííí1815.-----NEXT YEAR'S SPRING.

ííííTHE bed of flowers

ííííLoosens amain,The beauteous snowdrops

ííííDroop o'er the plain.The crocus opens

ííííIts glowing bud,Like emeralds others,

ííííOthers, like blood.With saucy gesture

ííííPrimroses flare,And roguish violets,

ííííHidden with care;And whatsoever

ííííThere stirs and strives,The Spring's contented,

ííííIf works and thrives.

íííí'Mongst all the blossoms

ííííThat fairest are,My sweetheart's sweetness

ííííIs sweetest far;Upon me ever

ííííHer glances light,My song they waken,

ííííMy words make bright,An ever open

ííííAnd blooming mind,In sport, unsullied,

ííííIn earnest, kind.Though roses and lilies

ííííBy Summer are brought,Against my sweetheart

ííííPrevails he nought.

íííí1816.-----AT MIDNIGHT HOUR.

íííí[Goethe relates that a remarkable situation he was in one brightmoonlight night led to the composition of this sweet song, whichwas ""the dearer to him because he could not say whence it cameand whither it would.""]

ííííAT midnight hour I went, not willingly,

ííííA little, little boy, yon churchyard past,To Father Vicar's house; the stars on high

ííííOn all around their beauteous radiance cast,

ííííAt midnight hour.

ííííAnd when, in journeying o'er the path of life,

ííííMy love I follow'd, as she onward moved,With stars and northern lights o'er head in strife,

ííííGoing and coming, perfect bliss I proved

ííííAt midnight hour.

ííííUntil at length the full moon, lustre-fraught,

ííííBurst thro' the gloom wherein she was enshrined;And then the willing, active, rapid thought

ííííAround the past, as round the future twined,

ííííAt midnight hour.

íííí1818.-----TO THE RISING FULL MOON.

ííííDornburg, 25th August, 1828.

ííííWILT thou suddenly enshroud thee,

ííííWho this moment wert so nigh?Heavy rising masses cloud thee,

ííííThou art hidden from mine eye.

ííííYet my sadness thou well knowest,

ííííGleaming sweetly as a star!That I'm loved, 'tis thou that showest,

ííííThough my loved one may be far.

ííííUpward mount then! clearer, milder,

ííííRobed in splendour far more bright!Though my heart with grief throbs wilder,

ííííFraught with rapture is the night!

íííí1828.-----THE BRIDEGROOM.*

íííí(Not in the English sense of the word, but the German, where ithas the meaning of betrothed.)

ííííI SLEPT,--'twas midnight,--in my bosom woke,

ííííAs though 'twere day, my love-o'erflowing heart;To me it seemed like night, when day first broke;

ííííWhat is't to me, whate'er it may impart?

ííííShe was away; the world's unceasing strife

ííííFor her alone I suffer'd through the heatOf sultry day; oh, what refreshing life

ííííAt cooling eve!--my guerdon was complete.

ííííThe sun now set, and wand'ring hand in hand,

ííííHis last and blissful look we greeted then;While spake our eyes, as they each other scann'd:

íííí""From the far east, let's trust, he'll come again!""

ííííAt midnight!--the bright stars, in vision blest,

ííííGuide to the threshold where she slumbers calm:Oh be it mine, there too at length to rest,--

ííííYet howsoe'er this prove, life's full of charm!

íííí1828.-----SUCH, SUCH IS HE WHO PLEASETH ME.

ííííFLY, dearest, fly! He is not nigh!

ííííHe who found thee one fair morn in Spring

ííííIn the wood where thou thy flight didst wing.Fly, dearest, fly! He is not nigh!Never rests the foot of evil spy.

ííííHark! flutes' sweet strains and love's refrains

ííííReach the loved one, borne there by the wind,

ííííIn the soft heart open doors they find.Hark! flutes' sweet strains and love's refrains,Hark!--yet blissful love their echo pains.

ííííErect his head, and firm his tread,

ííííRaven hair around his smooth brow strays,

ííííOn his cheeks a Spring eternal plays.Erect his head, and firm his tread,And by grace his ev'ry step is led.

ííííHappy his breast, with pureness bless'd,

ííííAnd the dark eyes 'neath his eyebrows placed,

ííííWith full many a beauteous line are graced.Happy his breast, with pureness bless'd,Soon as seen, thy love must be confess'd.

ííííHis mouth is red--its power I dread,

ííííOn his lips morn's fragrant incense lies,

ííííRound his lips the cooling Zephyr sighs.His mouth is red--its power I dread,With one glance from him, all sorrow's fled.

ííííHis blood is true, his heart bold too,

ííííIn his soft arms, strength, protection, dwells

ííííAnd his face with noble pity swells.His blood is true, his heart bold too,Blest the one whom those dear arms may woo!

íííí1816..-----SICILIAN SONG.

ííííYE black and roguish eyes,

ííííIf ye command.Each house in ruins lies,

ííííNo town can stand.And shall my bosom's chain,--

ííííThis plaster wall,?To think one moment, deign,--

ííííShall ii not fall?

íííí1811.-----SWISS SONG,

ííííUp in th' mountainI was a-sitting,With the bird thereAs my guest,Blithely singing,Blithely springing,And buildingHis nest.

ííííIn the gardenI was a-standing,And the bee thereSaw as well,Buzzing, humming,Going, coming,And buildingHis cell.

ííííO'er the meadowI was a-going,And there saw theButterflies,Sipping, dancing,Flying, glancing,And charmingThe eyes.

ííííAnd then came myDear Hansel,And I show'd themWith glee,Sipping, quaffing,And he, laughing,Sweet kissesGave me.

íííí1811.-----FINNISH SONG.

ííííIF the loved one, the well-known one,Should return as he departed,On his lips would ring my kisses,Though the wolf's blood might have dyed them;And a hearty grasp I'd give him,Though his finger-ends were serpents.

ííííWind! Oh, if thou hadst but reason,Word for word in turns thou'dst carry,E'en though some perchance might perish'Tween two lovers so far distant.

ííííAll choice morsels I'd dispense with,Table-flesh of priests neglect too,Sooner than renounce my lover,Whom, in Summer having vanquish'd,I in Winter tamed still longer.

íííí1810.-----GIPSY SONG.

ííííIN the drizzling mist, with the snow high-pil'd,In the Winter night, in the forest wild,I heard the wolves with their ravenous howl,I heard the screaming note of the owl:

ííííWille wau wau wau!

ííííWille wo wo wo!

ííííWito hu!

ííííI shot, one day, a cat in a ditch--The dear black cat of Anna the witch;Upon me, at night, seven were-wolves came down,Seven women they were, from out of the town.

ííííWille wau wau wau!

ííííWille wo wo wo!

ííííWito hu!

ííííI knew them all; ay, I knew them straight;First, Anna, then Ursula, Eve, and Kate,And Barbara, Lizzy, and Bet as well;And forming a ring, they began to yell:

ííííWille wau wau wau!

ííííWille wo wo wo!

ííííWito hu!

ííííThen call'd I their names with angry threat:""What wouldst thou, Anna? What wouldst thou, Bet?""At hearing my voice, themselves they shook,And howling and yelling, to flight they took.

ííííWille wau wau wau!

ííííWille wo wo wo!

ííííWito hu!

íííí1772.-----THE DESTRUCTION OF MAGDEBURG.

íííí[For a fine account of the fearful sack of Magdeburg, by Tilly,in the year 1613, see SCHILLER's History of the Thirty Years'War.]

ííííOH, Magdeberg the town!Fair maids thy beauty crown,Thy charms fair maids and matrons crown;Oh, Magdeburg the town!

ííííWhere all so blooming stands,Advance fierce Tilly's bands;O'er gardens and o'er well--till'd landsAdvance fierce Tilly's bands.

ííííNow Tilly's at the gate.Our homes who'll liberate?Go, loved one, hasten to the gate,And dare the combat straight!

ííííThere is no need as yet,However fierce his threat;Thy rosy cheeks I'll kiss, sweet pet!There is no need as yet.

ííííMy longing makes me pale.Oh, what can wealth avail?E'en now thy father may be pale.Thou mak'st my courage fail.

ííííOh, mother, give me bread!Is then my father dead?Oh, mother, one small crust of bread!Oh, what misfortune dread!

ííííThy father, dead lies he,The trembling townsmen flee,Adown the street the blood runs free;Oh, whither shall we flee?

ííííThe churches ruined lie,The houses burn on high,The roofs they smoke, the flames out fly,Into the street then hie!

ííííNo safety there they meet!The soldiers fill the Street,With fire and sword the wreck complete:No safety there they meet!

ííííDown falls the houses' line,Where now is thine or mine?That bundle yonder is not thine,Thou flying maiden mine!

ííííThe women sorrow sore.The maidens far, far more.The living are no virgins more;Thus Tilly's troops make war!-----

ííííFAMILIAR SONGS.

íííí------What we sing in companySoon from heart to heart will fly.-----

ííííTHE Gesellige Lieder, which I have angicisled as above, asseveral of them cannot be called convivial songs, are separatedby Goethe from his other songs, and I have adhered to the samearrangement. The Ergo bibamus is a well-known drinking song inGermany, where it enjoys vast popularity.

ííííON THE NEW YEAR.

íííí[Composed for a merry party that used to meet, in 1802, atGoethe's house.]

ííííFATE now allows us,

íííí'Twixt the departing

ííííAnd the upstarting,Happy to be;And at the call of

ííííMemory cherish'd,

ííííFuture and perish'dMoments we see.

ííííSeasons of anguish,--

ííííAh, they must ever

ííííTruth from woe sever,Love and joy part;Days still more worthy

ííííSoon will unite us,

ííííFairer songs light us,Strength'ning the heart.

ííííWe, thus united,

ííííThink of, with gladness,

ííííRapture and sadness,Sorrow now flies.Oh, how mysterious

ííííFortune's direction!

ííííOld the connection,

ííííNew-born the prize!

ííííThank, for this, Fortune,

ííííWavering blindly!

ííííThank all that kindlyFate may bestow!Revel in change's

ííííImpulses clearer,

ííííLove far sincerer,More heartfelt glow!

ííííOver the old one,

ííííWrinkles collected,

ííííSad and dejected,Others may view;But, on us gently

ííííShineth a true one,

ííííAnd to the new oneWe, too, are new.

ííííAs a fond couple

íííí'Midst the dance veering,

ííííFirst disappearing,Then reappear,So let affection

ííííGuide thro' life's mazy

ííííPathways so hazyInto the year!

íííí1802.-----ANNIVERSARY SONG.

íííí[This little song describes the different members of the partyjust spoken of.]

ííííWHY pacest thou, my neighbour fair,

ííííThe garden all alone?If house and land thou seek'st to guard,

ííííI'd thee as mistress own.

ííííMy brother sought the cellar-maid,

ííííAnd suffered her no rest;She gave him a refreshing draught,

ííííA kiss, too, she impress'd.

ííííMy cousin is a prudent wight,

ííííThe cook's by him ador'd;He turns the spit round ceaselessly,

ííííTo gain love's sweet reward.

ííííWe six together then began

ííííA banquet to consume,When lo! a fourth pair singing came,

ííííAnd danced into the room.

ííííWelcome were they,--and welcome too

ííííWas a fifth jovial pair.Brimful of news, and stored with tales

ííííAnd jests both new and rare.

ííííFor riddles, spirit, raillery,

ííííAnd wit, a place remain'd;A sixth pair then our circle join'd,

ííííAnd so that prize was gain'd.

ííííAnd yet to make us truly blest,

ííííOne miss'd we, and full sore;A true and tender couple came,--

ííííWe needed them no more.

ííííThe social banquet now goes on,

ííííUnchequer'd by alloy;The sacred double-numbers then

ííííLet us at once enjoy!

íííí1802.-----THE SPRING ORACLE.

ííííOH prophetic bird so bright,Blossom-songster, cuckoo bight!In the fairest time of year,Dearest bird, oh! deign to hearWhat a youthful pair would pray,Do thou call, if hope they may:Thy cuck-oo, thy cuck-oo.Ever more cuck-oo, cuck-oo!

ííííHearest thou? A loving pairFain would to the altar fare;Yes! a pair in happy youth,Full of virtue, full of truth.Is the hour not fix'd by fate?Say, how long must they still wait?Hark! cuck-oo! hark! cuck-oo!Silent yet! for shame, cuck-oo!

íííí'Tis not our fault, certainly!Only two years patient be!But if we ourselves please here,Will pa-pa-papas appear?Know that thou'lt more kindness do us,More thou'lt prophesy unto us.One! cuck-oo! Two! cuck-oo!Ever, ever, cuck-oo, cuck-oo, coo!

ííííIf we've calculated clearly,We have half a dozen nearly.If good promises we'll give,Wilt thou say how long we'II live?Truly, we'll confess to thee,We'd prolong it willingly.Coo cuck-oo, coo cuck-oo,Coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo!

ííííLife is one continued feast--(If we keep no score, at least).If now we together dwell,Will true love remain as well?For if that should e'er decay,Happiness would pass away.Coo cuck-oo, coo cuck-oo,Coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo!

íííí1803.*(Gracefully in infinitum.)-----THE HAPPY COUPLE.

ííííAFTER these vernal rains

ííííThat we so warmly sought,Dear wife, see how our plains

ííííWith blessings sweet are fraught!We cast our distant gaze

ííííFar in the misty blue;Here gentle love still strays,

ííííHere dwells still rapture true.

ííííThou seest whither go

ííííYon pair of pigeons white,Where swelling violets blow

ííííRound sunny foliage bright.'Twas there we gather'd first

ííííA nosegay as we roved;There into flame first burst

ííííThe passion that we proved.

ííííYet when, with plighted troth,

ííííThe priest beheld us fareHome from the altar both,

ííííWith many a youthful pair,--Then other moons had birth,

ííííAnd many a beauteous sun,Then we had gain'd the earth

ííííWhereon life's race to run.

ííííA hundred thousand fold

ííííThe mighty bond was seal'd;In woods, on mountains cold,

ííííIn bushes, in the field,Within the wall, in caves,

ííííAnd on the craggy height,And love, e'en o'er the waves,

ííííBore in his tube the light.

ííííContented we remain'd,

ííííWe deem'd ourselves a pair;'Twas otherwise ordain'd,

ííííFor, lo! a third was there;A fourth, fifth, sixth appear'd,

ííííAnd sat around our board;And now the plants we've rear'd

ííííHigh o'er our heads have soar'd!

ííííHow fair and pleasant looks,

ííííOn yonder beauteous spot,Embraced by poplar-brooks,

ííííThe newly-finish'd cot!Who is it there that sits

ííííIn that glad home above?Is't not our darling Fritz

ííííWith his own darling love?

ííííBeside yon precipice,

ííííWhence pent-up waters steal,And leaving the abyss,

ííííFall foaming through the wheel,Though people often tell

ííííOf millers' wives so fair,Yet none can e'er excel

ííííOur dearest daughter there!

ííííYet where the thick-set green

ííííStands round yon church and sad,Where the old fir-tree's seen

ííííAlone tow'rd heaven to nod,--'Tis there the ashes lie

ííííOf our untimely dead;From earth our gaze on high

ííííBy their blest memory's led.

ííííSee how yon hill is bright

ííííWith billowy-waving arms!The force returns, whose might

ííííHas vanquished war's alarms.Who proudly hastens here

ííííWith wreath-encircled brow?'Tis like our child so dear

ííííThus Charles comes homeward now.

ííííThat dearest honour'd guest

ííííIs welcom'd by the bride;She makes the true one blest,

ííííAt the glad festal tide.And ev'ry one makes haste

ííííTo join the dance with glee;While thou with wreaths hast graced

ííííThe youngest children three.

ííííTo sound of flute and horn

ííííThe time appears renew'd,When we, in love's young morn,

ííííIn the glad dance upstood;And perfect bliss I know

ííííEre the year's course is run,For to the font we go

ííííWith grandson and with son!

íííí1803.*-----SONG OF FELLOWSHIP.

íííí[Written and sung in honour of the birthday of the Pastor Ewaldat the time of Goethe's happy connection with Lily.]

ííííIN ev'ry hour of joy

ííííThat love and wine prolong,The moments we'll employ

ííííTo carol forth this song!We're gathered in His name,

ííííWhose power hath brought us here;He kindled first our flame,

ííííHe bids it burn more clear.

ííííThen gladly glow to-night,

ííííAnd let our hearts combine!Up! quaff with fresh delight

ííííThis glass of sparkling wine!Up! hail the joyous hour,

ííííAnd let your kiss be true;With each new bond of power

ííííThe old becomes the new!

ííííWho in our circle lives,

ííííAnd is not happy there?True liberty it gives,

ííííAnd brother's love so fair.Thus heart and heart through life

ííííWith mutual love are fill'd;And by no causeless strife

ííííOur union e'er is chill'd.

ííííOur hopes a God has crown'd

ííííWith life-discernment free,And all we view around,

ííííRenews our ecstasy.Ne'er by caprice oppress'd,

ííííOur bliss is ne'er destroy'd;More freely throbs our breast,

ííííBy fancies ne'er alloy'd.

ííííWhere'er our foot we set,

ííííThe more life's path extends,And brighter, brighter yet

ííííOur gaze on high ascends.We know no grief or pain,

ííííThough all things fall and rise;Long may we thus remain!

ííííEternal be our ties!

íííí1775.-----CONSTANCY IN CHANGE.

ííííCOULD this early bliss but rest

ííííConstant for one single hour!But e'en now the humid West

ííííScatters many a vernal shower.Should the verdure give me joy?

íííí'Tis to it I owe the shade;Soon will storms its bloom destroy,

ííííSoon will Autumn bid it fade.

ííííEagerly thy portion seize,

ííííIf thou wouldst possess the fruit!Fast begin to ripen these,

ííííAnd the rest already shoot.With each heavy storm of rain

ííííChange comes o'er thy valley fair;Once, alas! but not again

ííííCan the same stream hold thee e'er.

ííííAnd thyself, what erst at least

ííííFirm as rocks appear'd to rise,Walls and palaces thou seest

ííííBut with ever-changing eyes.Fled for ever now the lip

ííííThat with kisses used to glow,And the foot, that used to skip

ííííO'er the mountain, like the roe.

ííííAnd the hand, so true and warm,

ííííEver raised in charity,And the cunning-fashion'd form,--

ííííAll are now changed utterly.And what used to bear thy name,

ííííWhen upon yon spot it stood,Like a rolling billow came,

ííííHast'ning on to join the flood.

ííííBe then the beginning found

ííííWith the end in unison,Swifter than the forms around

ííííAre themselves now fleeting on!Thank the merit in thy breast,

ííííThank the mould within thy heart,That the Muses' favour blestNe'er will perish, ne'er depart.

íííí1803.*-----TABLE SONG.

íííí[Composed for the merry party already mentioned, on the occasionof the departure for France of the hereditary prince, who was oneof the number, and who is especially alluded to in the 3rdverse.]

ííííO'ER me--how I cannot say,--

ííííHeav'nly rapture's growing.Will it help to guide my way

ííííTo yon stars all-glowing?Yet that here I'd sooner be,

ííííTo assert I'm able,Where, with wine and harmony,

ííííI may thump the table.

ííííWonder not, my dearest friends,

ííííWhat 'tis gives me pleasure;For of all that earth e'er lends,

íííí'Tis the sweetest treasure.Therefore solemnly I swear,

ííííWith no reservation,That maliciously I'll ne'er

ííííLeave my present station.

ííííNow that here we're gather'd round,

ííííChasing cares and slumbers,Let, methought, the goblet sound

ííííTo the bard's glad numbers!Many a hundred mile away,

ííííGo those we love dearly;Therefore let us here to-day

ííííMake the glass ring clearly!

ííííHere's His health, through Whom we live!

ííííI that faith inherit.To our king the next toast give,

ííííHonour is his merit,'Gainst each in-- and outward foe

ííííHe's our rock and tower.Of his maintenance thinks he though,

ííííMore that grows his power.

ííííNext to her good health I drink,

ííííWho has stirr'd my passion;Of his mistress let each think,

ííííThink in knightly fashion.If the beauteous maid but see

ííííWhom 'tis I now call so,Let her smiling nod to me:

íííí""Here's my love's health also!""

ííííTo those friends,--the two or three,--

ííííBe our next toast given,In whose presence revel we,

ííííIn the silent even,--Who the gloomy mist so cold

ííííScatter gently, lightly;To those friends, then, new or old,

ííííLet the toast ring brightly.

ííííBroader now the stream rolls on,

ííííWith its waves more swelling,While in higher, nobler tone,

ííííComrades, we are dwelling,--We who with collected might,

ííííBravely cling together,Both in fortune's sunshine bright,

ííííAnd in stormy weather.

ííííJust as we are gather'd thus,

ííííOthers are collected;On them, therefore, as on us,

ííííBe Fate's smile directed!From the springhead to the sea,

ííííMany a mill's revolving,And the world's prosperity

ííííIs the task I'm solving.

íííí1802.-----WONT AND DONE.

ííííI HAVE loved; for the first time with passion I rave!I then was the servant, but now am the slave;

ííííI then was the servant of all:By this creature so charming I now am fast bound,To love and love's guerdon she turns all around,

ííííAnd her my sole mistress I call.

ííííl've had faith; for the first time my faith is now strong!And though matters go strangely, though matters go wrong,

ííííTo the ranks of the faithful I'm true:Though ofttimes 'twas dark and though ofttimes 'twas drear,In the pressure of need, and when danger was near,

ííííYet the dawning of light I now view.

ííííI have eaten; but ne'er have thus relish'd my food!For when glad are the senses, and joyous the blood,

ííííAt table all else is effacedAs for youth, it but swallows, then whistles an air;As for me, to a jovial resort I'd repair,

ííííWhere to eat, and enjoy what I taste.

ííííI have drunk; but have never thus relish'd the bowl!For wine makes us lords, and enlivens the soul,

ííííAnd loosens the trembling slave's tongue.Let's not seek to spare then the heart-stirring drink,For though in the barrel the old wine may sink,

ííííIn its place will fast mellow the young.

ííííI have danced, and to dancing am pledged by a vow!Though no caper or waltz may be raved about now,

ííííIn a dance that's becoming, whirl round.And he who a nosegay of flowers has dress'd,And cares not for one any more than the rest,

ííííWith a garland of mirth is aye crown'd.

ííííThen once more be merry, and banish all woes!For he who but gathers the blossoming rose.

ííííBy its thorns will be tickled alone.To-day still, as yesterday, glimmers the star;Take care from all heads that hang down to keep far,

ííííAnd make but the future thine own.

íííí1813.-----GENERAL CONFESSION.

ííííIn this noble ring to-day

ííííLet my warning shame ye!Listen to my solemn voice,--

ííííSeldom does it name ye.Many a thing have ye intended,

ííííMany a thing have badly ended,And now I must blame ye.

ííííAt some moment in our lives

ííííWe must all repent us!So confess, with pious trust,

ííííAll your sins momentous!Error's crooked pathways shunning.

ííííLet us, on the straight road running,Honestly content us!

ííííYes! we've oft, when waking, dream'd,

ííííLet's confess it rightly;Left undrain'd the brimming cup,

ííííWhen it sparkled brightly;Many a shepherd's-hour's soft blisses,

ííííMany a dear mouth's flying kissesWe've neglected lightly.

ííííMute and silent have we sat,

ííííWhilst the blockheads prated,And above e'en song divine

ííííHave their babblings rated;To account we've even call'd us

ííííFor the moments that enthrall'd us,With enjoyment freighted.

ííííIf thou'lt absolution grant

ííííTo thy true ones ever,We, to execute thy will,

ííííCeaseless will endeavour,From half-measures strive to wean us,

ííííWholly, fairly, well demean us,Resting, flagging never.

ííííAt all blockheads we'll at once

ííííLet our laugh ring clearly,And the pearly-foaming wine

ííííNever sip at merely.Ne'er with eye alone give kisses,

ííííBut with boldness suck in blissesFrom those lips loved dearly.

íííí1803.*-----COPTIC SONG.

ííííLEAVE we the pedants to quarrel and strive,

ííííRigid and cautious the teachers to be!All of the wisest men e'er seen alive

ííííSmile, nod, and join in the chorus with me:""Vain 'tis to wait till the dolt grows less silly!Play then the fool with the fool, willy-nilly,--

ííííChildren of wisdom,--remember the word!""

ííííMerlin the old, from his glittering grave,When I, a stripling, once spoke to him,--gave

ííííJust the same answer as that I've preferr'd;""Vain 'tis to wait till the dolt grows less silly!Play then the fool with the fool, willy-nilly,--

ííííChildren of wisdom,--remember the word!""

ííííAnd on the Indian breeze as it booms,And in the depths of Egyptian tombs,

ííííOnly the same holy saying I've heard:""Vain 'tis to wait till the dolt grows less silly!Play then the fool with the fool, willy-nilly,--

ííííChildren of wisdom,--remember the word!""

íííí1789.*-----ANOTHER.

ííííGo! obedient to my call,

ííííTurn to profit thy young days,

ííííWiser make betimes thy breast

ííííIn Fate's balance as it sways,

ííííSeldom is the cock at rest;Thou must either mount, or fall,

ííííThou must either rule and win,

ííííOr submissively give in,Triumph, or else yield to clamour:Be the anvil or the hammer.

íííí1789.-----VANITAS! VANITATUM VANITAS!

ííííMY trust in nothing now is placed,

ííííHurrah!So in the world true joy I taste,

ííííHurrah!Then he who would be a comrade of mineMust rattle his glass, and in chorus combine,Over these dregs of wine.

ííííI placed my trust in gold and wealth,

ííííHurrah!But then I lost all joy and health,

ííííLack-a-day!Both here and there the money roll'd,And when I had it here, behold,From there had fled the gold!

ííííI placed my trust in women next,

ííííHurrah!But there in truth was sorely vex'd,

ííííLack-a-day!The False another portion sought,The True with tediousness were fraught,The Best could not be bought.

ííííMy trust in travels then I placed,

ííííHurrah!And left my native land in haste.

ííííLack-a-day!But not a single thing seem'd good,The beds were bad, and strange the food,And I not understood.

ííííI placed my trust in rank and fame,

ííííHurrah!Another put me straight to shame,

ííííLack-a-day!And as I had been prominent,All scowl'd upon me as I went,I found not one content.

ííííI placed my trust in war and fight,

ííííHurrah!We gain'd full many a triumph bright,

ííííHurrah!Into the foeman's land we cross'd,We put our friends to equal cost,And there a leg I lost.

ííííMy trust is placed in nothing now,

ííííHurrah!At my command the world must bow,

ííííHurrah!And as we've ended feast and strain,The cup we'll to the bottom drain;No dregs must there remain!

íííí1806.-----FORTUNE OF WAR.

ííííNOUGHT more accursed in war I know

ííííThan getting off scot-free;Inured to danger, on we go

ííííIn constant victory;We first unpack, then pack again,

ííííWith only this reward,That when we're marching, we complain,

ííííAnd when in camp, are bor'd.

ííííThe time for billeting comes next,--

ííííThe peasant curses it;Each nobleman is sorely vex'd,

íííí'Tis hated by the cit.Be civil, bad though be thy food,

ííííThe clowns politely treat;If to our hosts we're ever rude,

ííííJail-bread we're forced to eat.

ííííAnd when the cannons growl around,

ííííAnd small arms rattle clear,And trumpet, trot, and drum resound,

ííííWe merry all appear;And as it in the fight may chance,

ííííWe yield, then charge amain,And now retire, and now advance,

ííííAnd yet a cross ne'er gain.

ííííAt length there comes a musket-ball,

ííííAnd hits the leg, please Heaven;And then our troubles vanish all,

ííííFor to the town we're driven,(Well cover'd by the victor's force,)

ííííWhere we in wrath first came,--The women, frightened then, of course,

ííííAre loving now and tame.

ííííCellar and heart are open'd wide,

ííííThe cook's allow'd no rest;While beds with softest down supplied

ííííAre by our members press'd.The nimble lads upon us wait,

ííííNo sleep the hostess takesHer shift is torn in pieces straight,--

ííííWhat wondrous lint it makes!

ííííIf one has tended carefully

ííííThe hero's wounded limb,Her neighbour cannot rest, for she

ííííHas also tended him.A third arrives in equal haste,

ííííAt length they all are there,And in the middle he is placed

ííííOf the whole band so fair!

ííííOn good authority the king

ííííHears how we love the fight,And bids them cross and ribbon bring,

ííííOur coat and breast to dight.Say if a better fate can e'er

ííííA son of Mars pursue!'Midst tears at length we go from there,

ííííBeloved and honour'd too.

íííí1814.-----OPEN TABLE.

ííííMANY a guest I'd see to-day,

ííííMet to taste my dishes!Food in plenty is prepar'd,

ííííBirds, and game, and fishes.Invitations all have had,

ííííAll proposed attending.Johnny, go and look around!

ííííAre they hither wending?

ííííPretty girls I hope to see,

ííííDear and guileless misses,Ignorant how sweet it is

ííííGiving tender kisses.Invitations all have had,

ííííAll proposed attending.Johnny, go and look around!

ííííAre they hither wending?

ííííWomen also I expect,

ííííLoving tow'rd their spouses,Whose rude grumbling in their breasts

ííííGreater love but rouses.Invitations they've had too,

ííííAll proposed attending!Johnny, go and look around!

ííííAre they hither wending?

ííííI've too ask'd young gentlemen,

ííííWho are far from haughty,And whose purses are well-stock'd,

ííííWell-behaved, not haughty.These especially I ask'd,

ííííAll proposed attending.Johnny, go and look around!

ííííAre they hither wending?

ííííMen I summon'd with respect,

ííííWho their own wives treasure;Who in ogling other Fair

ííííNever take a pleasure.To my greetings they replied,

ííííAll proposed attending.Johnny, go and look around!

ííííAre they hither wending?

ííííThen to make our joy complete,

ííííPoets I invited,Who love other's songs far more

ííííThan what they've indited.All acceded to my wish,

ííííAll proposed attending.Johnny, go and look around!

ííííAre they hither wending?

ííííNot a single one appears,

ííííNone seem this way posting.All the soup boils fast away,

ííííJoints are over-roasting.Ah, I fear that we have been

ííííRather too unbending!Johnny, tell me what you think!

ííííNone are hither wending.

ííííJohnny, run and quickly bring

ííííOther guests to me now!Each arriving as he is--

ííííThat's the plan, I see now.In the town at once 'tis known,

ííííEvery one's commending.Johnny, open all the doors:

ííííAll are hither wending!

íííí1815.*-----THE RECKONING.

ííííLEADER.

ííííLET no cares now hover o'er us

ííííLet the wine unsparing run!Wilt thou swell our merry chorus?

ííííHast thou all thy duty done?

ííííSOLO.

ííííTwo young folks--the thing is curious--

ííííLoved each other; yesterdayBoth quite mild, to-day quite furious,

ííííNext day, quite the deuce to pay!If her neck she there was stooping,

ííííHe must here needs pull his hair.I revived their spirits drooping,

ííííAnd they're now a happy pair.

ííííCHORUS.

ííííSurely we for wine may languish!

ííííLet the bumper then go round!For all sighs and groans of anguish

ííííThou to-day in joy hast drown'd.

ííííSOLO.

ííííWhy, young orphan, all this wailing?

íííí""Would to heaven that I were dead!For my guardian's craft prevailing

ííííSoon will make me beg my bread.""Knowing well the rascal genus,

ííííInto court I dragg'd the knave;Fair the judges were between us,

ííííAnd the maiden's wealth did save.

ííííCHORUS.

ííííSurely we for wine may languish!

ííííLet the bumper then go round!For all sighs and groans of anguish

ííííThou to-day in joy hast drown'd.

ííííSOLO.

ííííTo a little fellow, quiet,

ííííUnpretending and subdued,Has a big clown, running riot,

ííííBeen to-day extremely rude.I bethought me of my duty,

ííííAnd my courage swell'd apace,So I spoil'd the rascal's beauty,

ííííSlashing him across the face.

ííííCHORUS.

ííííSurely we for wine may languish!

ííííLet the bumper then go round!For all sighs and groans of anguish

ííííThou to-day in joy hast drown'd.

ííííSOLO.

ííííBrief must be my explanation,

ííííFor I really have done nought.Free from trouble and vexation,

ííííI a landlord's business bought.There I've done, with all due ardour,

ííííAll that duty order'd me;Each one ask'd me for the larder,

ííííAnd there was no scarcity.

ííííCHORUS.

ííííSurely we for wine may languish!

ííííLet the bumper then go round!For all sighs and groans of anguish

ííííThou to-day in joy hast drown'd.

ííííLEADER.

ííííEach should thus make proclamation

ííííOf what he did well to-day!That's the match whose conflagration

ííííShould inflame our tuneful lay.Let it be our precept ever

ííííTo admit no waverer here!For to act the good endeavour,

ííííNone but rascals meek appear.

ííííCHORUS.

ííííSurely we for wine may languish!

ííííLet the bumper then go round!For all sighs and groans of anguish

ííííWe have now in rapture drown'd.

ííííTRIO.

ííííLet each merry minstrel enter,

ííííHe's right welcome to our hall!'Tis but with the self─tormentor

ííííThat we are not liberal;

ííííFor we fear that his caprices,

ííííThat his eye-brows dark and sad,That his grief that never ceases

ííííHide an empty heart, or bad.

ííííCHORUS.

ííííNo one now for wine shall languish!

ííííHere no minstrel shall be found,Who all sighs and groans of anguish,

ííííHas not first in rapture drown'd!

íííí1810.-----ERGO BIBAMUS!

ííííFOR a praiseworthy object we're now gather'd here,

ííííSo, brethren, sing: ERGO BIBAMUS!Tho' talk may be hush'd, yet the glasses ring clear,

ííííRemember then: ERGO BIBAMUS!In truth 'tis an old, 'tis an excellent word,With its sound so befitting each bosom is stirr'd,And an echo the festal hall filling is heard,

ííííA glorious ERGO BIBAMUS!

ííííI saw mine own love in her beauty so rare,

ííííAnd bethought me of: ERGO BIBAMUS;So I gently approach'd, and she let me stand there,

ííííWhile I help'd myself, thinking: BIBAMUS!And when she's appeased, and will clasp you and kiss,Or when those embraces and kisses ye miss,Take refuge, till sound is some worthier bliss,

ííííIn the comforting ERGO BIBAMUS!

ííííI am call'd by my fate far away from each friend;

ííííYe loved ones, then: ERGO BIBAMUS!With wallet light-laden from hence I must wend.

ííííSo double our ERGO BIBAMUS!Whate'er to his treasures the niggard may add,Yet regard for the joyous will ever be had,For gladness lends over its charms to the glad,

ííííSo, brethren, sing; ERGO BIBAMUS!

ííííAnd what shall we say of to-day as it flies?

ííííI thought but of: ERGO BIBAMUS'Tis one of those truly that seldom arise,

ííííSo again and again sing: BIBAMUS!For joy through a wide-open portal it guides,Bright glitter the clouds, as the curtain divides,An a form, a divine one, to greet us in glides,

ííííWhile we thunder our: ERGO BIBAMUS!

íííí1810.-----EPIPHANIAS.

ííííTHE three holy kings with their star's bright ray,--They eat and they drink, but had rather not pay;They like to eat and drink away,They eat and drink, but had rather not pay.

ííííThe three holy kings have all come here,In number not four, but three they appear;And if a fourth join'd the other three,Increased by one their number would be.

ííííThe first am I,--the fair and the white,I ought to be seen when the sun shines bright!But, alas! with all my spices and myrrh,No girl now likes me,--I please not her.

ííííThe next am I,--the brown and the long,Known well to women, known well to song.Instead of spices, 'tis gold I bear,And so I'm welcome everywhere.

ííííThe last am I,--the black and small,And fain would be right merry withal.I like to eat and to drink full measure,I eat and drink, and give thanks with pleasure.

ííííThe three holy kings are friendly and mild,They seek the Mother, and seek the Child;The pious Joseph is sitting by,The ox and the ass on their litter lie.

ííííWe're bringing gold, we're bringing myrrh,The women incense always prefer;And if we have wine of a worthy growth,We three to drink like six are not loth.

ííííAs here we see fair lads and lasses,But not a sign of oxen or asses,We know that we have gone astrayAnd so go further on our way.-----

ííííBALLADS.

íííí-----Poet's art is ever ableTo endow with truth mere fable.----MIGNON.[This universally known poem is also to be found in WilhelmMeister.]

ííííKNOW'ST thou the land where the fair citron blows,Where the bright orange midst the foliage glows,Where soft winds greet us from the azure skies,Where silent myrtles, stately laurels rise,Know'st thou it well?

íííí'Tis there, 'tis there,That I with thee, beloved one, would repair.

ííííKnow'st thou the house? On columns rests its pile,Its halls are gleaming, and its chambers smile,And marble statues stand and gaze on me:""Poor child! what sorrow hath befallen thee?""Know'st thou it well?

íííí'Tis there, 'tis there,That I with thee, protector, would repair!

ííííKnow'st thou the mountain, and its cloudy bridge?The mule can scarcely find the misty ridge;In caverns dwells the dragon's olden brood,The frowning crag obstructs the raging flood.Know'st thou it well?

íííí'Tis there, 'tis there,Our path lies--Father--thither, oh repair!

íííí1795.*-----THE MINSTREL.

íííí[This fine poem is introduced in the second book of WilhelmMeister.]

íííí""WHAT tuneful strains salute mine ear

ííííWithout the castle walls?Oh, let the song re-echo here,

ííííWithin our festal halls!""Thus spake the king, the page out-hied;The boy return'd; the monarch cried:

íííí""Admit the old man yonder!""

íííí""All hail, ye noble lords to-night!

ííííAll hail, ye beauteous dames!Star placed by star! What heavenly sight!

ííííWhoe'er can tell their names?Within this glittering hall sublime,Be closed, mine eyes! 'tis not the time

ííííFor me to feast my wonder.""

ííííThe minstrel straightway closed his eyes,

ííííAnd woke a thrilling tone;The knights look'd on in knightly guise,

ííííFair looks tow'rd earth were thrown.The monarch, ravish'd by the strain,Bade them bring forth a golden chain,

ííííTo be his numbers' guerdon.

íííí""The golden chain give not to me,

ííííBut give the chain to thoseIn whose bold face we shiver'd see

ííííThe lances of our foes.Or give it to thy chancellor there;With other burdens he may bear

ííííThis one more golden burden.

íííí""I sing, like birds of blithesome note,

ííííThat in the branches dwell;The song that rises from the throat

ííííRepays the minstrel well.One boon I'd crave, if not too bold--One bumper in a cup of gold

ííííBe as my guerdon given.""

ííííThe bowl he raised, the bowl he quaff'd:

íííí""Oh drink, with solace fraught!Oh, house thrice-blest, where such a draught

ííííA trifling gift is thought!When Fortune smiles, remember me,And as I thank you heartily,

ííííAs warmly thank ye Heaven!""

íííí1795.*-----BALLAD

ííííOF THE BANISHED AND RETURNING COUNT.

íííí[Goethe began to write an opera called Lowenstuhl, founded uponthe old tradition which forms the subject of this Ballad, but henever carried out his design.]

ííííOH, enter old minstrel, thou time-honour'd one!We children are here in the hall all alone,

ííííThe portals we straightway will bar.Our mother is praying, our father is gone

ííííTo the forest, on wolves to make war.Oh sing us a ballad, the tale then repeat,

íííí'Till brother and I learn it right;We long have been hoping a minstrel to meet,

ííííFor children hear tales with delight.

íííí""At midnight, when darkness its fearful veil weaves,His lofty and stately old castle he leaves,

ííííBut first he has buried his wealth.What figure is that in his arms one perceives,

ííííAs the Count quits the gateway by stealth?O'er what is his mantle so hastily thrown?

ííííWhat bears he along in his flight?A daughter it is, and she gently sleeps on""--

ííííThe children they hear with delight.

íííí""The morning soon glimmers. the world is so wide,In valleys and forests a home is supplied,

ííííThe bard in each village is cheer'd.Thus lives he and wanders, while years onward glide,

ííííAnd longer still waxes his beard;But the maiden so fair in his arms grows amain,

íííí'Neath her star all-protecting and bright,Secured in the mantle from wind and from rain--""

ííííThe children they hear with delight.

íííí""And year upon year with swift footstep now steals,The mantle it fades, many rents it reveals,

ííííThe maiden no more it can hold.The father he sees her, what rapture he feels!

ííííHis joy cannot now be controll'd.How worthy she seems of the race whence she springs,

ííííHow noble and fair to the sight!What wealth to her dearly-loved father she brings!""--

ííííThe children they hear with delight.

íííí""Then comes there a princely knight galloping by,She stretches her hand out, as soon as he's nigh,

ííííBut alms he refuses to give.He seizes her hand, with a smile in his eye:

íííí'Thou art mine!' he exclaims, 'while I live!''When thou know'st,' cries the old man, 'the treasure that'sthere,

ííííA princess thou'lt make her of right;Betroth'd be she now, on this spot green and fair--'""

ííííThe children they hear with delight.

íííí""So she's bless'd by the priest on the hallowed place,And she goes with a smiling but sorrowful face,

ííííFrom her father she fain would not part.The old man still wanders with ne'er-changing pace,

ííííHe covers with joy his sad heart.So I think of my daughter, as years pass away,

ííííAnd my grandchildren far from my sight;I bless them by night, and I bless them by day""--

ííííThe children they hear with delight.

ííííHe blesses the children: a knocking they hear,The father it is! They spring forward in fear,

ííííThe old man they cannot conceal--""Thou beggar, wouldst lure, then, my children so dear?

ííííStraight seize him, ye vassals of steel!To the dungeon most deep, with the fool-hardy knave!""

ííííThe mother from far hears the fight;She hastens with flatt'ring entreaty to crave--

ííííThe children they hear with delight.

ííííThe vassals they suffer the Bard to stand there,And mother and children implore him to spare,

ííííThe proud prince would stifle his ire,'Till driven to fury at hearing their prayer,

ííííHis smouldering anger takes fire:""Thou pitiful race! Oh, thou beggarly crew!

ííííEclipsing my star, once so bright!Ye'll bring me destruction, ye sorely shall rue!""

ííííThe children they hear with affright.

ííííThe old man still stands there with dignified mien,The vassals of steel quake before him, I ween,

ííííThe Count's fury increases in power;""My wedded existence a curse long has been,

ííííAnd these are the fruits from that flower!'Tis ever denied, and the saying is true,

ííííThat to wed with the base-born is right;The beggar has borne me a beggarly crew,--""

ííííThe children they hear with affright.

íííí""If the husband, the father, thus treats you with scorn,If the holiest bonds by him rashly are torn,

ííííThen come to your father--to me!The beggar may gladden life's pathway forlorn,

ííííThough aged and weak he may be.This castle is mine! thou hast made it thy prey,

ííííThy people 'twas put me to flight;The tokens I bear will confirm what I say""--

ííííThe children they hear with delight.

íííí""The king who erst govern'd returneth again,And restores to the Faithful the goods that were ta'en,

ííííI'll unseal all my treasures the while;The laws shall be gentle, and peaceful the reign""--

ííííThe old man thus cries with a smile--""Take courage, my son! all hath turned out for good,

ííííAnd each hath a star that is bright,Those the princess hath borne thee are princely in blood,""--

ííííThe children thy hear with delight.

íííí1816.-----THE VIOLET.

ííííUPON the mead a violet stood,Retiring, and of modest mood,

ííííIn truth, a violet fair.Then came a youthful shepherdess,And roam'd with sprightly joyousness,And blithely woo'd

ííííWith carols sweet the air

íííí""Ah!"" thought the violet, ""had I beenFor but the smallest moment e'en

ííííNature's most beauteous flower,'Till gather'd by my love, and press'd,When weary, 'gainst her gentle breast,For e'en, for e'en

ííííOne quarter of an hour!""

ííííAlas! alas! the maid drew nigh,The violet failed to meet her eye,

ííííShe crush'd the violet sweet.It sank and died, yet murmur'd not:""And if I die, oh, happy lot,For her I die,

ííííAnd at her very feet!""

íííí1775.*-----THE FAITHLESS BOY.

ííííTHERE was a wooer blithe and gay,

ííííA son of France was he,--Who in his arms for many a day,

ííííAs though his bride were she,A poor young maiden had caress'd,And fondly kiss'd, and fondly press'd,

ííííAnd then at length deserted.

ííííWhen this was told the nut-brown maid,

ííííHer senses straightway fled;She laugh'd and wept, and vow'd and pray'd,

ííííAnd presently was dead.The hour her soul its farewell took,The boy was sad, with terror shook,

ííííThen sprang upon his charger.

ííííHe drove his spurs into his side,

ííííAnd scour'd the country round;But wheresoever he might ride,

ííííNo rest for him was found.For seven long days and nights he rode,It storm'd, the waters overflow'd,

ííííIt bluster'd, lighten'd, thunder'd.

ííííOn rode he through the tempest's din,

ííííTill he a building spied;In search of shelter crept he in,

ííííWhen he his steed had tied.And as he groped his doubtful way,The ground began to rock and sway,--

ííííHe fell a hundred fathoms.

ííííWhen he recover'd from the blow,

ííííHe saw three lights pass by;He sought in their pursuit to go,

ííííThe lights appear'd to fly.They led his footsteps all astray,Up, down, through many a narrow way

ííííThrough ruin'd desert cellars.

ííííWhen lo! he stood within a hall,

ííííWith hollow eyes. and grinning all;They bade him taste the fare.

ííííA hundred guests sat there.He saw his sweetheart 'midst the throng,Wrapp'd up in grave-clothes white and long;

ííííShe turn'd, and----*

íííí1774.(* This ballad is introduced in Act II. of Claudine of VillaBella, where it is suddenly broken off, as it is here.)-----THE ERL-KING.

ííííWHO rides there so late through the night dark and drear?The father it is, with his infant so dear;He holdeth the boy tightly clasp'd in his arm,He holdeth him safely, he keepeth him warm.

íííí""My son, wherefore seek'st thou thy face thus to hide?""""Look, father, the Erl-King is close by our side!Dost see not the Erl-King, with crown and with train?""""My son, 'tis the mist rising over the plain.""

íííí""Oh, come, thou dear infant! oh come thou with me!Full many a game I will play there with thee;On my strand, lovely flowers their blossoms unfold,My mother shall grace thee with garments of gold.""

íííí""My father, my father, and dost thou not hearThe words that the Erl-King now breathes in mine ear?""""Be calm, dearest child, 'tis thy fancy deceives;'Tis the sad wind that sighs through the withering leaves.""

íííí""Wilt go, then, dear infant, wilt go with me there?My daughters shall tend thee with sisterly careMy daughters by night their glad festival keep,They'll dance thee, and rock thee, and sing thee to sleep.""

íííí""My father, my father, and dost thou not see,How the Erl-King his daughters has brought here for me?""""My darling, my darling, I see it aright,'Tis the aged grey willows deceiving thy sight.""

íííí""I love thee, I'm charm'd by thy beauty, dear boy!And if thou'rt unwilling, then force I'll employ.""""My father, my father, he seizes me fast,Full sorely the Erl-King has hurt me at last.""

ííííThe father now gallops, with terror half wild,He grasps in his arms the poor shuddering child;He reaches his courtyard with toil and with dread,--The child in his arms finds he motionless, dead.

íííí1782.*-----JOHANNA SEBUS.

íííí[To the memory of an excellent and beautiful girl of 17,belonging to the village of Brienen, who perished on the 13th ofJanuary, 1809, whilst giving help on the occasion of the breakingup of the ice on the Rhine, and the bursting of the dam ofCleverham.]

ííííTHE DAM BREAKS DOWN, THE ICE-PLAIN GROWLS,THE FLOODS ARISE, THE WATER HOWLS.

íííí""I'll bear thee, mother, across the swell,

íííí'Tis not yet high, I can wade right well.""

íííí""Remember us too! in what danger are we!

ííííThy fellow-lodger, and children three!

ííííThe trembling woman!--Thou'rt going away!""

ííííShe bears the mother across the spray.

íííí""Quick! haste to the mound, and awhile there wait,

ííííI'll soon return, and all will be straight.

ííííThe mound's close by, and safe from the wet;

ííííBut take my goat too, my darling pet!""

ííííTHE DAM DISSOLVES, THE ICE-PLAIN GROWLS,THE FLOODS DASH ON, THE WATER HOWLS.

ííííShe places the mother safe on the shore;

ííííFair Susan then turns tow'rd the flood once more.

íííí""Oh whither? Oh whither? The breadth fast grows,

ííííBoth here and there the water o'erflows.

ííííWilt venture, thou rash one, the billows to brave?""""THEY SHALL, AND THEY MUST BE PRESERVED FROM THE WAVE!""

ííííTHE DAM DISAPPEARS, THE WATER GROWLS,LIKE OCEAN BILLOWS IT HEAVES AND HOWLS.

ííííFair Susan returns by the way she had tried,

ííííThe waves roar around, but she turns not aside;

ííííShe reaches the mound, and the neighbour straight,

ííííBut for her and the children, alas, too late!

ííííTHE DAM DISAPPEAR'D,--LIKE A SEA IT GROWLS,ROUND THE HILLOCK IN CIRCLING EDDIES IT HOWLS.

ííííThe foaming abyss gapes wide, and whirls round,

ííííThe women and children are borne to the ground;

ííííThe horn of the goat by one is seized fast,

ííííBut, ah, they all must perish at last!

ííííFair Susan still stands-there, untouch'd by the wave;

ííííThe youngest, the noblest, oh, who now will save?

ííííFair Susan still stands there, as bright as a star,

ííííBut, alas! all hope, all assistance is far.

ííííThe foaming waters around her roar,

ííííTo save her, no bark pushes off from the shore.

ííííHer gaze once again she lifts up to Heaven,

ííííThen gently away by the flood she is driven.

ííííNO DAM, NO PLAIN! TO MARK THE PLACESOME STRAGGLING TREES ARE THE ONLY TRACE.

ííííThe rushing water the wilderness covers,

ííííYet Susan's image still o'er it hovers.--

ííííThe water sinks, the plains re-appear.

ííííFair Susan's lamented with many a tear,--

ííííMay he who refuses her story to tell,

ííííBe neglected in life and in death as well!

íííí1809.-----THE FISHERMAN.

ííííTHE waters rush'd, the waters rose,

ííííA fisherman sat by,While on his line in calm repose

ííííHe cast his patient eye.And as he sat, and hearken'd there,

ííííThe flood was cleft in twain,And, lo! a dripping mermaid fair

ííííSprang from the troubled main.

ííííShe sang to him, and spake the while:

íííí""Why lurest thou my brood,With human wit and human guile

ííííFrom out their native flood?Oh, couldst thou know how gladly dart

ííííThe fish across the sea,Thou wouldst descend, e'en as thou art,

ííííAnd truly happy be!

íííí""Do not the sun and moon with grace

ííííTheir forms in ocean lave?Shines not with twofold charms their face,

ííííWhen rising from the wave?The deep, deep heavens, then lure thee not,--

ííííThe moist yet radiant blue,--Not thine own form,--to tempt thy lot

íííí'Midst this eternal dew?""

ííííThe waters rush'd, the waters rose,

ííííWetting his naked feet;As if his true love's words were those,

ííííHis heart with longing beat.She sang to him, to him spake she,

ííííHis doom was fix'd, I ween;Half drew she him, and half sank he,

ííííAnd ne'er again was seen.

íííí1779.*-----THE KING OF THULE.*

íííí(* This ballad is also introduced in Faust, where it is sung byMargaret.)

ííííIN Thule lived a monarch,

ííííStill faithful to the grave,To whom his dying mistress

ííííA golden goblet gave.

ííííBeyond all price he deem'd it,

ííííHe quaff'd it at each feast;And, when he drain'd that goblet,

ííííHis tears to flow ne'er ceas'd.

ííííAnd when he felt death near him,

ííííHis cities o'er he told,And to his heir left all things,

ííííBut not that cup of gold.

ííííA regal banquet held he

ííííIn his ancestral ball,In yonder sea-wash'd castle,

íííí'Mongst his great nobles all.

ííííThere stood the aged reveller,

ííííAnd drank his last life's-glow,--Then hurl'd the holy goblet

ííííInto the flood below.

ííííHe saw it falling, filling,

ííííAnd sinking 'neath the main,His eyes then closed for ever,

ííííHe never drank again.

íííí1774.-----

ííííTHE BEAUTEOUS FLOWER.

ííííSONG OF THE IMPRISONED COUNT.

ííííCOUNT.

ííííI KNOW a flower of beauty rare,

ííííAh, how I hold it dear!To seek it I would fain repair,

ííííWere I not prison'd here.My sorrow sore oppresses me,For when I was at liberty,

ííííI had it close beside me.

ííííThough from this castle's walls so steep

ííííI cast mine eyes around,And gaze oft from the lofty keep,

ííííThe flower can not be found.Whoe'er would bring it to my sight,Whether a vassal he, or knight,

ííííMy dearest friend I'd deem him.

ííííTHE ROSE.

ííííI blossom fair,--thy tale of woes

ííííI hear from 'neath thy grate.Thou doubtless meanest me, the rose.

ííííPoor knight of high estate!Thou hast in truth a lofty mind;The queen of flowers is then enshrin'd,

ííííI doubt not, in thy bosom.

ííííCOUNT.

ííííThy red, in dress of green array'd,

ííííAs worth all praise I hold;And so thou'rt treasured by each maid

ííííLike precious stones or gold.Thy wreath adorns the fairest faceBut still thou'rt not the flower whose grace

ííííI honour here in silence.

ííííTHE LILY.

ííííThe rose is wont with pride to swell,

ííííAnd ever seeks to rise;But gentle sweethearts love full well

ííííThe lily's charms to prize,The heart that fills a bosom true,That is, like me, unsullied too,

ííííMy merit values duly.

ííííCOUNT.

ííííIn truth, I hope myself unstain'd,

ííííAnd free from grievous crime;Yet I am here a prisoner chain'd,

ííííAnd pass in grief my time,To me thou art an image sureOf many a maiden, mild and pure,

ííííAnd yet I know a dearer.

ííííTHE PINK.

ííííThat must be me, the pink, who scent

ííííThe warder's garden here;Or wherefore is he so intent

ííííMy charms with care to rear?My petals stand in beauteous ring,Sweet incense all around I fling,

ííííAnd boast a thousand colours.

ííííCOUNT.

ííííThe pink in truth we should not slight,

ííííIt is the gardener's prideIt now must stand exposed to light,

ííííNow in the shade abide.Yet what can make the Count's heart glowIs no mere pomp of outward show;

ííííIt is a silent flower.

ííííTHE VIOLET.

ííííHere stand I, modestly half hid,

ííííAnd fain would silence keep;Yet since to speak I now am bid,

ííííI'll break my silence deep.If, worthy Knight, I am that flower,It grieves me that I have not power

ííííTo breathe forth all my sweetness.

ííííCOUNT.

ííííThe violet's charms I prize indeed,

ííííSo modest 'tis, and fair,And smells so sweet; yet more I need

ííííTo ease my heavy care.The truth I'll whisper in thine ear:Upon these rocky heights so drear,

ííííI cannot find the loved one.

ííííThe truest maiden 'neath the sky

ííííRoams near the stream below,And breathes forth many a gentle sigh,

ííííTill I from hence can go.And when she plucks a flow'ret blue,And says ""Forget-me-not!""--I, too,

ííííThough far away, can feel it.

ííííAy, distance only swells love's might,

ííííWhen fondly love a pair;Though prison'd in the dungeon's night,

ííííIn life I linger thereAnd when my heart is breaking nigh,""Forget-me-not!"" is all I cry,

ííííAnd straightway life returneth.

íííí1798.-----SIR CURT'S WEDDING-JOURNEY.

ííííWITH a bridegroom's joyous bearing,

ííííMounts Sir Curt his noble beast,To his mistress' home repairing,

ííííThere to hold his wedding feast;When a threatening foe advances

ííííFrom a desert, rocky spot;For the fray they couch their lances,

ííííNot delaying, speaking not.

ííííLong the doubtful fight continues,

ííííVictory then for Curt declares;Conqueror, though with wearied sinews,

ííííForward on his road he fares.When he sees, though strange it may be,

ííííSomething 'midst the foliage move;'Tis a mother, with her baby,

ííííStealing softly through the grove!

ííííAnd upon the spot she beckons--

íííí""Wherefore, love, this speed so wild?Of the wealth thy storehouse reckons,

ííííHast thou nought to give thy child!""Flames of rapture now dart through him,

ííííAnd he longs for nothing more,While the mother seemeth to him

ííííLovely as the maid of yore.

ííííBut he hears his servants blowing,

ííííAnd bethinks him of his bride;And ere long, while onward going,

ííííChances past a fair to ride;In the booths he forthwith buys him

ííííFor his mistress many a pledge;But, alas! some Jews surprise him,

ííííAnd long-standing debts allege.

ííííAnd the courts of justice duly

ííííSend the knight to prison straight.Oh accursed story, truly!

ííííFor a hero, what a fate!Can my patience such things weather?

ííííGreat is my perplexity.Women, debts, and foes together,--

ííííAh, no knight escapes scot free!

íííí1803.*-----WEDDING SONG.

ííííTHE tale of the Count our glad song shall record

ííííWho had in this castle his dwelling,Where now ye are feasting the new-married lord,

ííííHis grandson of whom we are telling.The Count as Crusader had blazon'd his fame,Through many a triumph exalted his name,And when on his steed to his dwelling he came,

ííííHis castle still rear'd its proud head,But servants and wealth had all fled.

íííí'Tis true that thou, Count, hast return'd to thy home,

ííííBut matters are faring there ill.The winds through the chambers at liberty roam,

ííííAnd blow through the windows at willWhat's best to be done in a cold autumn night?Full many I've pass'd in more piteous plight;The morn ever settles the matter aright.

ííííThen quick, while the moon shines so clear,

ííííTo bed on the straw, without fear,

ííííAnd whilst in a soft pleasing slumber he lay,

ííííA motion he feels 'neath his bed.The rat, an he likes it, may rattle away!

ííííAy, had he but crumbs there outspread!But lo! there appears a diminutive wight,A dwarf 'tis, yet graceful, and bearing a light,With orator-gestures that notice invite,

ííííAt the feet of the Count on the floor

ííííWho sleeps not, though weary full sore.

íííí""We've long been accustom'd to hold here our feast,

ííííSince thou from thy castle first went;And as we believed thou wert far in the East,

ííííTo revel e'en now we were bent.And if thou'lt allow it, and seek not to chide,We dwarfs will all banquet with pleasure and pride,To honour the wealthy, the beautiful bride

ííííSays the Count with a smile, half-asleep;--

íííí""Ye're welcome your quarters to keep!""

ííííThree knights then advance, riding all in a group,

ííííWho under the bed were conceal'd;And then is a singing and noise-making troop

ííííOf strange little figures reveal'd;And waggon on waggon with all kinds of things--The clatter they cause through the ear loudly rings--The like ne'er was seen save in castles of kings;

ííííAt length, in a chariot of gold,

ííííThe bride and the guests too, behold!

ííííThen all at full gallop make haste to advance,

ííííEach chooses his place in the hall;With whirling and waltzing, and light joyous dance,

ííííThey begin with their sweethearts the ball.The fife and the fiddle all merrily sound,Thy twine, and they glide, and with nimbleness bound,Thy whisper, and chatter, and, chatter around;

ííííThe Count on the scene casts his eye,

ííííAnd seems in a fever to lie.

ííííThey hustle, and bustle, and rattle away

ííííOn table, on bench, and on stool;Then all who had joined in the festival gay

ííííWith their partners attempt to grow cool.The hams and the sausages nimbly they bear,And meat, fish, and poultry in plenty are there,Surrounded with wine of the vintage most rare:

ííííAnd when they have revell'd full long,

ííííThey vanish at last with a song.

íííí*      *      *      *      *      *

ííííAnd if we're to sing all that further occurr'd,

ííííPray cease ye to bluster and prate;For what he so gladly in small saw and heard

ííííHe enjoy'd and he practis'd in great.For trumpets, and singing, and shouts without endOn the bridal-train, chariots and horsemen attend,They come and appear, and they bow and they bend,

ííííIn merry and countless array.

ííííThus was it, thus is it to-day.

íííí1802.-----THE TREASURE-DIGGER

ííííALL my weary days I pass'd

ííííSick at heart and poor in purse.

ííííPoverty's the greatest curse,

ííííRiches are the highest good!And to end my woes at last,

ííííTreasure-seeking forth I sped.

íííí""Thou shalt have my soul instead!""

ííííThus I wrote, and with my blood.

ííííRing round ring I forthwith drew,

ííííWondrous flames collected there,

ííííHerbs and bones in order fair,

ííííTill the charm had work'd aright.Then, to learned precepts true,

ííííDug to find some treasure old,

ííííIn the place my art foretold

ííííBlack and stormy was the night.

ííííComing o'er the distant plain,

ííííWith the glimmer of a star,

ííííSoon I saw a light afar,

ííííAs the hour of midnight knell'd.Preparation was in vain.

ííííSudden all was lighted up

ííííWith the lustre of a cup

ííííThat a beauteous boy upheld.

ííííSweetly seem'd his eves to laugh

ííííNeath his flow'ry chaplet's load;

ííííWith the drink that brightly glow'd,

ííííHe the circle enter'd in.And he kindly bade me quaff:

ííííThen methought ""This child can ne'er,

ííííWith his gift so bright and fair,

ííííTo the arch-fiend be akin.""

íííí""Pure life's courage drink!"" cried he:""This advice to prize then learn,--

ííííNever to this place return

ííííTrusting in thy spells absurd;Dig no longer fruitlessly.

ííííGuests by night, and toil by day!

ííííWeeks laborious, feast-days gay!

ííííBe thy future magic-word!

íííí1797.-----THE RAT-CATCHER.

ííííI AM the bard known far and wide,The travell'd rat-catcher beside;A man most needful to this town,So glorious through its old renown.However many rats I see,How many weasels there may be,I cleanse the place from ev'ry one,All needs must helter-skelter run.

ííííSometimes the bard so full of cheerAs a child-catcher will appear,Who e'en the wildest captive brings,Whene'er his golden tales he sings.However proud each boy in heart,However much the maidens start,I bid the chords sweet music make,And all must follow in my wake.

ííííSometimes the skilful bard ye viewIn the form of maiden-catcher too;For he no city enters e'er,Without effecting wonders there.However coy may be each maid,However the women seem afraid,Yet all will love-sick be ere longTo sound of magic lute and song.

íííí[Da Capo.]                  1803.*-----

ííííTHE SPINNER.

ííííAs I calmly sat and span,

ííííToiling with all zeal,Lo! a young and handsome man

ííííPass'd my spinning-wheel.

ííííAnd he praised,--what harm was there?--

ííííSweet the things he said--Praised my flax-resembling hair,

ííííAnd the even thread.

ííííHe with this was not content,

ííííBut must needs do more;And in twain the thread was rent,

ííííThough 'twas safe before.

ííííAnd the flax's stonelike weight

ííííNeeded to be told;But no longer was its state

ííííValued as of old.

ííííWhen I took it to the weaver,

ííííSomething felt I start,And more quickly, as with fever,

ííííThrobb'd my trembling heart.

ííííThen I bear the thread at length

ííííThrough the heat, to bleach;But, alas, I scarce have strength

ííííTo the pool to reach.

ííííWhat I in my little room

ííííSpan so fine and slight,--As was likely. I presume--

ííííCame at last to light.

íííí1800.*-----BEFORE A COURT OF JUSTICE.

ííííTHE father's name ye ne'er shall be told

ííííOf my darling unborn life;""Shame, shame,"" ye cry, ""on the strumpet bold!""

ííííYet I'm an honest wife.

ííííTo whom I'm wedded, ye ne'er shall be told,

ííííYet he's both loving and fair;He wears on his neck a chain of gold,

ííííAnd a hat of straw doth he wear.

ííííIf scorn 'tis vain to seek to repel,

ííííOn me let the scorn be thrown.I know him well, and he knows me well,

ííííAnd to God, too, all is known.

ííííSir Parson and Sir Bailiff, again,

ííííI pray you, leave me in peace!My child it is, my child 'twill remain,

ííííSo let your questionings cease!

íííí1815.*-----THE PAGE AND THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER.

ííííPAGE.

ííííWHERE goest thou? Where?Miller's daughter so fair!

ííííThy name, pray?--

ííííMILLER'S DAUGHTER.

íííí'Tis Lizzy.

ííííPAGE.Where goest thou? Where?With the rake in thy hand?

ííííMILLER'S DAUGHTER.Father's meadows and land

ííííTo visit, I'm busy.

ííííPAGE.Dost go there alone?

ííííMILLER'S DAUGHTER.By this rake, sir, 'tis shown

ííííThat we're making the hay;And the pears ripen fastIn the garden at last,

ííííSo I'll pick them to-day.

ííííPAGE.Is't a silent thicket I yonder view?

ííííMILLER'S DAUGHTER.Oh, yes! there are two;There's one on each side.

ííííPAGE.I'll follow thee soon;When the sun burns at noonWe'll go there, o'urselves from his rays to hide,And then in some glade all-verdant and deep--

ííííMILLER'S DAUGHTER.Why, people would say--

ííííPAGE.Within mine arms thou gently wilt sleep.

ííííMILLER'S DAUGHTER.

ííííYour pardon, I pray!Whoever is kiss'd by the miller-maid,Upon the spot must needs be betray'd.

íííí'Twould give me distress

ííííTo cover with whiteYour pretty dark dress.Equal with equal! then all is right!That's the motto in which I delight.I am in love with the miller-boy;He wears nothing that I could destroy.

íííí1797.-----THE YOUTH AND THE MILLSTREAM.

íííí[This sweet Ballad, and the one entitled The Maid of the Mill'sRepentance, were written on the occasion of a visit paid by Goetheto Switzerland. The Maid of the Mill's Treachery, to which thelatter forms the sequel, was not written till the following year.]

ííííYOUTH.

ííííSAY, sparkling streamlet, whither thou

ííííArt going!With joyous mien thy waters now

ííííAre flowing.Why seek the vale so hastily?Attend for once, and answer me!

ííííMILLSTREAM.

ííííOh youth, I was a brook indeed;

ííííBut latelyMy bed they've deepen'd, and my speed

ííííSwell'd greatly,That I may haste to yonder mill.And so I'm full and never still.

ííííYOUTH.

ííííThe mill thou seekest in a mood

ííííContented,And know'st not how my youthful blood

íííí'S tormented.But doth the miller's daughter fairGaze often on thee kindly there?

ííííMILLSTREAM.

ííííShe opes the shutters soon as light

ííííIs gleaming;And comes to bathe her features bright

ííííAnd beaming.So full and snow-white is her breast,--I feel as hot as steam suppress'd.

ííííYOUTH.

ííííIf she in water can inflame

ííííSuch ardour,Surely, then, flesh and blood to tame

ííííIs harder.When once is seen her beauteous face,One ever longs her steps to trace.

ííííMILLSTREAM.

ííííOver the wheel I, roaring, bound,

ííííAll-proudly,And ev'ry spoke whirls swiftly round,

ííííAnd loudly.Since I have seen the miller's daughter,With greater vigour flows the water.

ííííYOUTH.

ííííLike others, then, can grief, poor brook,

ííííOppress thee?""Flow on!""--thus she'll, with smiling look,

ííííAddress thee.With her sweet loving glance, oh say,Can she thy flowing current stay?

ííííMILLSTREAM.

íííí'Tis sad, 'tis sad to have to speed

ííííFrom yonder;I wind, and slowly through the mead

ííííWould wander;And if the choice remain'd with me,Would hasten back there presently.

ííííYOUTH.

ííííFarewell, thou who with me dost prove

ííííLove's sadness!Perchance some day thou'lt breathe of love

ííííAnd gladness.Go, tell her straight, and often too,The boy's mute hopes and wishes true.

íííí1797.-----

ííííTHE MAID OF THE MILL'S TREACHERY.

íííí[This Ballad is introduced in the Wanderjahre, in a tale calledThe Foolish Pilgrim.]

ííííWHENCE comes our friend so hastily,

ííííWhen scarce the Eastern sky is grey?Hath he just ceased, though cold it be,

ííííIn yonder holy spot to pray?The brook appears to hem his path,

ííííWould he barefooted o'er it go?Why curse his orisons in wrath,

ííííAcross those heights beclad with snow?

ííííAlas! his warm bed he bath left,

ííííWhere he had look'd for bliss, I ween;And if his cloak too, had been reft,

ííííHow fearful his disgrace had been!By yonder villain sorely press'd,

ííííHis wallet from him has been torn;Our hapless friend has been undress'd,

ííííLeft well nigh naked as when born.

ííííThe reason why he came this road,

ííííIs that he sought a pair of eyes,Which, at the mill, as brightly glow'd

ííííAs those that are in Paradise.He will not soon again be there;

ííííFrom out the house he quickly hied,And when he gain'd the open air,

ííííThus bitterly and loudly cried

íííí""Within her gaze, so dazzling bright,

ííííNo word of treachery I could read;She seem'd to see me with delight,

ííííYet plann'd e'en then this cruel deed!Could I, when basking in her smile,

ííííDream of the treason in her breast?She bade kind Cupid stay awhile,

ííííAnd he was there, to make us blest.

íííí""To taste of love's sweet ecstasy

ííííThroughout the night, that endless seem'd,And for her mother's help to cry

ííííOnly when morning sunlight beam'd!A dozen of her kith and kin,

ííííA very human flood, in-press'dHer cousins came, her aunts peer'd in,

ííííAnd uncles, brothers, and the rest.

íííí""Then what a tumult, fierce and loud!

ííííEach seem'd a beast of prey to be;The maiden's honour all the crowd,

ííííWith fearful shout, demand of me.Why should they, madmen-like, begin

ííííTo fall upon a guiltless youth?For he who such a prize would win,

ííííFar nimbler needs must be, in truth.

íííí""The way to follow up with skill

ííííHis freaks, by love betimes is known:He ne'er will leave, within a mill,

ííííSweet flowers for sixteen years alone.--They stole my clothes away,--yes, all!

ííííAnd tried my cloak besides to steal.How strange that any house so small

ííííSo many rascals could conceal!

íííí""Then I sprang up, and raved, and swore,

ííííTo force a passage through them there.I saw the treacherous maid once more,

ííííAnd she was still, alas, so fairThey all gave way before my wrath,

ííííWild outcries flew about pell-mell;At length I managed to rush forth,

ííííWith voice of thunder, from that hell.

íííí""As maidens of the town we fly,

ííííWe'll shun you maidens of the village;Leave it to those of quality

ííííTheir humble worshippers to pillage.Yet if ye are of practised skill,

ííííAnd of all tender ties afraid,Exchange your lovers, if ye will,

ííííBut never let them be betray'd.""

ííííThus sings he in the winter-night,

ííííWhile not a blade of grass was green.I laugh'd to see his piteous plight,

ííííFor it was well-deserved, I ween.And may this be the fate of all,

ííííWho treat by day their true loves ill,And, with foolhardy daring, crawl

ííííBy night to Cupid's treacherous mill!

íííí1798.-----THE MAID OF THE MILL'S REPENTANCE.

ííííYOUTH.

ííííAWAY, thou swarthy witch! Go forth

ííííFrom out my house, I tell thee!Or else I needs must, in my wrath,

ííííExpel thee!What's this thou singest so falsely, forsooth,Of love and a maiden's silent truth?

ííííWho'll trust to such a story!

ííííGIPSY.

ííííI sing of a maid's repentant fears,

ííííAnd long and bitter yearning;Her levity's changed to truth and tears

ííííAll-burning.She dreads no more the threats of her mother,She dreads far less the blows of her brother,

ííííThan the dearly loved-one's hatred.

ííííYOUTH.

ííííOf selfishness sing and treacherous lies,

ííííOf murder and thievish plunder!Such actions false will cause no surprise,

ííííOr wonder.When  they share their booty, both clothes and purse,--As bad as you gipsies, and even worse,

ííííSuch tales find ready credence.

ííííGIPSY.

íííí""Alas, alas! oh what have I done?

ííííCan listening aught avail me?I hear him toward my room hasten on,

ííííTo hail me.My heart beat high, to myself I said:'O would that thou hadst never betray'd

ííííThat night of love to thy mother!'""

ííííYOUTH.

ííííAlas! I foolishly ventured there,

ííííFor the cheating silence misled me;Ah, sweetest! let me to thee repair,--

ííííNor dread me!When suddenly rose a fearful din,Her mad relations came pouring in.

ííííMy blood still boils in my body!

ííííGIPSY.

íííí""Oh when will return an hour like this?

ííííI pine in silent sadness;I've thrown away my only true bliss

ííííWith madness.Alas, poor maid! O pity my youth!My brother was then full cruel in troth

ííííTo treat the loved one so basely!""

ííííTHE POET.

ííííThe swarthy woman then went inside,

ííííTo the spring in the courtyard yonder;Her eyes from their stain she purified,

ííííAnd,--wonder!--Her face and eyes were radiant and bright,And the maid of the mill was disclosed to the sight

ííííOf the startled and angry stripling!

ííííTHE MAID OF THE MILL.

ííííThou sweetest, fairest, dearly-loved life!

ííííBefore thine anger I cower;But blows I dread not, nor sharp-edged knife,--

ííííThis hourOf sorrow and love to thee I'll sing,And myself before thy feet I'll fling,

ííííAnd either live or die there!

ííííYOUTH.

ííííAffection, say, why buried so deep

ííííIn my heart hast thou lain hidden?By whom hast thou now to awake from thy sleep

ííííBeen bidden?Ah love, that thou art immortal I see!Nor knavish cunning nor treachery

ííííCan destroy thy life so godlike.

ííííTHE MAID OF THE MILL.

ííííIf still with as fond and heartfelt love,

ííííAs thou once didst swear, I'm cherish'd,Then nought of the rapture we used to prove

ííííIs perish'd.So take the woman so dear to thy breast!In her young and innocent charms be blest,

ííííFor all are thine from henceforward!

ííííBOTH.

ííííNow, sun, sink to rest! Now, sun, arise!

ííííYe stars, be now shining, now darkling!A star of love now gleams in the skies,

ííííAll-sparkling!As long as the fountain may spring and run,So long will we two be blended in one,

ííííUpon each other's bosoms!

íííí1797.-----THE TRAVELLER AND THE FARM~MAIDEN.

ííííHE.

ííííCANST thou give, oh fair and matchless maiden,

íííí'Neath the shadow of the lindens yonder,--

ííííWhere I'd fain one moment cease to wander,--Food and drink to one so heavy laden?

ííííSHE.

ííííWouldst thou find refreshment, traveller weary,

ííííBread, ripe fruit and cream to meet thy wishes,--

ííííNone but Nature's plain and homely dishes,--Near the spring may soothe thy wanderings dreary.

ííííHE.

ííííDreams of old acquaintance now pass through me,

ííííNe'er-forgotten queen of hours of blisses.

ííííLikenesses I've often found, but this isOne that quite a marvel seemeth to me!

ííííSHE.

ííííTravellers often wonder beyond measure,

ííííBut their wonder soon see cause to smother;

ííííFair and dark are often like each other,Both inspire the mind with equal pleasure.

ííííHE.

ííííNot now for the first time I surrender

ííííTo this form, in humble adoration;

ííííIt was brightest midst the constellationIn the hail adorn'd with festal splendour.

ííííSHE.

ííííBe thou joyful that 'tis in my power

ííííTo complete thy strange and merry story!

ííííSilks behind her, full of purple glory,Floated, when thou saw'st her in that hour.

ííííHE.

ííííNo, in truth, thou hast not sung it rightly!

ííííSpirits may have told thee all about it;

ííííPearls and gems they spoke of, do not doubt it,--By her gaze eclipsed,--it gleam'd so brightly!

ííííSHE.

ííííThis one thing I certainly collected:

ííííThat the fair one--(say nought, I entreat thee!)

ííííFondly hoping once again to meet thee,Many a castle in the air erected.

ííííHE.

ííííBy each wind I ceaselessly was driven,

ííííSeeking gold and honour, too, to capture!

ííííWhen my wand'rings end, then oh, what rapture,If to find that form again 'tis given!

ííííSHE.

íííí'Tis the daughter of the race now banish'd

ííííThat thou seest, not her likeness only;

ííííHelen and her brother, glad though lonely,Till this farm of their estate now vanish'd.

ííííHE.

ííííBut the owner surely is not wanting

ííííOf these plains, with ev'ry beauty teeming?

ííííVerdant fields, broad meads, and pastures gleaming,Gushing springs, all heav'nly and enchanting.

ííííSHE.

ííííThou must hunt the world through, wouldst thou find him!--

ííííWe have wealth enough in our possession,

ííííAnd intend to purchase the succession,When the good man leaves the world behind him.

ííííHE.

ííííI have learnt the owner's own condition,

ííííAnd, fair maiden, thou indeed canst buy it;

ííííBut the cost is great, I won't deny it,--Helen is the price,--with thy permission!

ííííSHE.

ííííDid then fate and rank keep us asunder,

ííííAnd must Love take this road, and no other?

ííííYonder comes my dear and trusty brother;What will he say to it all, I wonder?

íííí1803.*-----EFFECTS AT A DISTANCE.

ííííTHE queen in the lofty hall takes her place,

ííííThe tapers around her are flaming;She speaks to the page: ""With a nimble pace

ííííGo, fetch me my purse for gaming.

íííí'Tis lying, I'll pledge,

ííííOn my table's edge.""Each nerve the nimble boy straineth,And the end of the castle soon gaineth.

ííííThe fairest of maidens was sipping sherbet

ííííBeside the queen that minute;Near her mouth broke the cup,--and she got so wet!

ííííThe very devil seem'd in it

ííííWhat fearful distress

íííí'Tis spoilt, her gay dress.She hastens, and ev'ry nerve straineth,And the end of the castle soon gaineth.

ííííThe boy was returning, and quickly came,

ííííAnd met the sorrowing maiden;None knew of the fact,--and yet with Love's flame,

ííííThose two had their hearts full laden.

ííííAnd, oh the bliss

ííííOf a moment like this!Each falls on the breast of the other,With kisses that well nigh might smother.

ííííThey tear themselves asunder at last,

ííííTo her chamber she hastens quickly,To reach the queen the page hies him fast,

ííííMidst the swords and the fans crowded thickly.

ííííThe queen spied amain

ííííOn his waistcoat a stain;For nought was inscrutable to her,Like Sheba's queen--Solomon's wooer.

ííííTo her chief attendant she forthwith cried

íííí""We lately together contended,And thou didst assert, with obstinate pride,

ííííThat the spirit through space never wended,--

ííííThat traces alone

ííííBy the present were shown,--That afar nought was fashion'd--not evenBy the stars that illumine you heaven.

íííí""Now see! while a goblet beside me they drain'd,

ííííThey spilt all the drink in the chalice;And straightway the boy had his waistcoat stain'd

ííííAt the furthermost end of the palace.--

ííííLet them newly be clad!

ííííAnd since I am gladThat it served as a proof so decided,The cost will by me be provided.""

íííí1808.-----THE WALKING BELL

ííííA CHILD refused to go betimes

ííííTo church like other people;He roam'd abroad, when rang the chimes

ííííOn Sundays from the steeple.

ííííHis mother said: ""Loud rings the bell,

ííííIts voice ne'er think of scorning;Unless thou wilt behave thee well,

íííí'Twill fetch thee without warning.""

ííííThe child then thought: ""High over head

ííííThe bell is safe suspended--""So to the fields he straightway sped

ííííAs if 'twas school-time ended.

ííííThe bell now ceas'd as bell to ring,

ííííRoused by the mother's twaddle;But soon ensued a dreadful thing!--

ííííThe bell begins to waddle.

ííííIt waddles fast, though strange it seem;

ííííThe child, with trembling wonder,Runs off, and flies, as in a dream;

ííííThe bell would draw him under.

ííííHe finds the proper time at last,

ííííAnd straightway nimbly rushesTo church, to chapel, hastening fast

ííííThrough pastures, plains, and bushes.

ííííEach Sunday and each feast as well,

ííííHis late disaster heeds he;The moment that he bears the bell,

ííííNo other summons needs he.

íííí1813.-----FAITHFUL ECKART,

íííí""OH, would we were further! Oh, would we were home,The phantoms of night tow'rd us hastily come,

ííííThe band of the Sorceress sisters.They hitherward speed, and on finding us here,They'll drink, though with toil we have fetch'd it, the beer,

ííííAnd leave us the pitchers all empty.""

ííííThus speaking, the children with fear take to flight,When sudden an old man appears in their sight:

íííí""Be quiet, child! children, be quiet!From hunting they come, and their thirst they would still,So leave them to swallow as much as they will,

ííííAnd the Evil Ones then will be gracious.""

ííííAs said, so 'twas done! and the phantoms draw near,And shadowlike seem they, and grey they appear,

íííí~Yet blithely they sip and they revelThe beer has all vanish'd, the pitchers are void;With cries and with shouts the wild hunters, o'erjoy'd,

ííííSpeed onward o'er vale and o'er mountain.

ííííThe children in terror fly nimbly tow'rd home,And with them the kind one is careful to come:

íííí""My darlings, oh, be not so mournful!--""They'll blame us and beat us, until we are dead.""--""No, no! ye will find that all goes well,"" he said;

íííí""Be silent as mice, then, and listen!

íííí""And he by whose counsels thus wisely ye're taught,Is he who with children loves ever to sport.

ííííThe trusty and faithful old Eckart.Ye have heard of the wonder for many a day,But ne'er had a proof of the marvellous lay,--

ííííYour hands hold a proof most convincing.""

ííííThey arrive at their home, and their pitchers they placeBy the side of their parents, with fear on their face,

ííííAwaiting a beating and scolding.But see what they're tasting: the choicest of beer!Though three times and four times they quaff the good cheer

ííííThe pitchers remain still unemptied.

ííííThe marvel it lasts till the dawning of day;All people who hear of it doubtless will say:

íííí""What happen'd at length to the pitchers?""In secret the children they smile, as they wait;At last, though, they stammer, and stutter, and prate,

ííííAnd straightway the pitchers were empty.

ííííAnd if, children, with kindness address'd ye may be,Whether father, or master, or alderman he,

ííííObey him, and follow his bidding!And if 'tis unpleasant to bridle the tongue,Yet talking is bad, silence good for the young--

ííííAnd then will the beer fill your pitchers!

íííí1813.-----THE DANCE OF DEATH.

ííííTHE warder looks down at the mid hour of night,

ííííOn the tombs that lie scatter'd below:The moon fills the place with her silvery light,

ííííAnd the churchyard like day seems to glow.When see! first one grave, then another opes wide,And women and men stepping forth are descried,

ííííIn cerements snow-white and trailing.

ííííIn haste for the sport soon their ankles they twitch,

ííííAnd whirl round in dances so gay;The young and the old, and the poor, and the rich,

ííííBut the cerements stand in their way;And as modesty cannot avail them aught here,They shake themselves all, and the shrouds soon appear

ííííScatter'd over the tombs in confusion.

ííííNow waggles the leg, and now wriggles the thigh,

ííííAs the troop with strange gestures advance,And a rattle and clatter anon rises high,

ííííAs of one beating time to the dance.The sight to the warder seems wondrously queer,When the villainous Tempter speaks thus in his ear:

íííí""Seize one of the shrouds that lie yonder!""

ííííQuick as thought it was done! and for safety he fled

ííííBehind the church-door with all speed;The moon still continues her clear light to shed

ííííOn the dance that they fearfully lead.But the dancers at length disappear one by one,And their shrouds, ere they vanish, they carefully don,

ííííAnd under the turf all is quiet.

ííííBut one of them stumbles and shuffles there still,

ííííAnd gropes at the graves in despair;Yet 'tis by no comrade he's treated so ill

ííííThe shroud he soon scents in the air.So he rattles the door--for the warder 'tis wellThat 'tis bless'd, and so able the foe to repel,

ííííAll cover'd with crosses in metal.

ííííThe shroud he must have, and no rest will allow,

ííííThere remains for reflection no time;On the ornaments Gothic the wight seizes now,

ííííAnd from point on to point hastes to climb.Alas for the warder! his doom is decreed!Like a long-legged spider, with ne'er-changing speed,

ííííAdvances the dreaded pursuer.

ííííThe warder he quakes, and the warder turns pale,

ííííThe shroud to restore fain had sought;When the end,--now can nothing to save him avail,--

ííííIn a tooth formed of iron is caught.With vanishing lustre the moon's race is run,When the bell thunders loudly a powerful One,

ííííAnd the skeleton fails, crush'd to atoms.

íííí1813.-----THE PUPIL IN MAGIC.

ííííI AM now,--what joy to hear it!--

ííííOf the old magician rid;And henceforth shall ev'ry spirit

ííííDo whate'er by me is bid;

ííííI have watch'd with rigour

ííííAll he used to do,

ííííAnd will now with vigour

ííííWork my wonders too.

ííííWander, wander

ííííOnward lightly,

ííííSo that rightly

ííííFlow the torrent,

ííííAnd with teeming waters yonder

ííííIn the bath discharge its current!

ííííAnd now come, thou well-worn broom,

ííííAnd thy wretched form bestir;Thou hast ever served as groom,

ííííSo fulfil my pleasure, sir!

ííííOn two legs now stand,

ííííWith a head on top;

ííííWaterpail in hand,

ííííHaste, and do not stop!

ííííWander, wander

ííííOnward lightly,

ííííSo that rightly

ííííFlow the torrent,

ííííAnd with teeming waters yonder

ííííIn the bath discharge its current!

ííííSee! he's running to the shore,

ííííAnd has now attain'd the pool,And with lightning speed once more

ííííComes here, with his bucket full!

ííííBack he then repairs;

ííííSee how swells the tide!

ííííHow each pail he bears

ííííStraightway is supplied!

ííííStop, for, lo!

ííííAll the measure

ííííOf thy treasure

ííííNow is right!--

ííííAh, I see it! woe, oh woe!

ííííI forget the word of might.

ííííAh, the word whose sound can straight

ííííMake him what he was before!Ah, he runs with nimble gait!

ííííWould thou wert a broom once more!

ííííStreams renew'd for ever

ííííQuickly bringeth he;

ííííRiver after river

ííííRusheth on poor me!

ííííNow no longer

ííííCan I bear him;

ííííI will snare him,

ííííKnavish sprite!

ííííAh, my terror waxes stronger!

ííííWhat a look! what fearful sight

ííííOh, thou villain child of hell!

ííííShall the house through thee be drown'dFloods I see that wildly swell,

ííííO'er the threshold gaining ground.

ííííWilt thou not obey,

ííííOh, thou broom accurs'd?

ííííBe thou still I pray,

ííííAs thou wert at first!

ííííWill enough

ííííNever please thee?

ííííI will seize thee,

ííííHold thee fast,

ííííAnd thy nimble wood so tough,

ííííWith my sharp axe split at last.

ííííSee, once more he hastens back!

ííííNow, oh Cobold, thou shalt catch it!I will rush upon his track;

ííííCrashing on him falls my hatchet.

ííííBravely done, indeed!

ííííSee, he's cleft in twain!

ííííNow from care I'm freed,

ííííAnd can breathe again.

ííííWoe, oh woe!

ííííBoth the parts,

ííííQuick as darts,

ííííStand on end,

ííííServants of my dreaded foe!

ííííOh, ye gods protection send!

ííííAnd they run! and wetter still

ííííGrow the steps and grows the hail.Lord and master hear me call!

ííííEver seems the flood to fill,

ííííAh, he's coming! see,

ííííGreat is my dismay!

ííííSpirits raised by me

ííííVainly would I lay!

íííí""To the side

ííííOf the room

ííííHasten, broom,

ííííAs of old!

ííííSpirits I have ne'er untied

ííííSave to act as they are told.""

íííí1797.-----THE BRIDE OF CORINTH.

íííí[First published in Schiller's Horen, in connection with afriendly contest in the art of ballad-writing between the twogreat poets, to which many of their finest works are owing.]

ííííONCE a stranger youth to Corinth came,

ííííWho in Athens lived, but hoped that heFrom a certain townsman there might claim,

ííííAs his father's friend, kind courtesy.

ííííSon and daughter, they

ííííHad been wont to say

ííííShould thereafter bride and bridegroom be.

ííííBut can he that boon so highly prized,

ííííSave tis dearly bought, now hope to get?They are Christians and have been baptized,

ííííHe and all of his are heathens yet.

ííííFor a newborn creed,

ííííLike some loathsome weed,

ííííLove and truth to root out oft will threat.

ííííFather, daughter, all had gone to rest,

ííííAnd the mother only watches late;She receives with courtesy the guest,

ííííAnd conducts him to the room of state.

ííííWine and food are brought,

ííííEre by him besought;

ííííBidding him good night. she leaves him straight.

ííííBut he feels no relish now, in truth,

ííííFor the dainties so profusely spread;Meat and drink forgets the wearied youth,

ííííAnd, still dress'd, he lays him on the bed.

ííííScarce are closed his eyes,

ííííWhen a form in-hies

ííííThrough the open door with silent tread.

ííííBy his glimmering lamp discerns he now

ííííHow, in veil and garment white array'd,With a black and gold band round her brow,

ííííGlides into the room a bashful maid.

ííííBut she, at his sight,

ííííLifts her hand so white,

ííííAnd appears as though full sore afraid.

íííí""Am I,"" cries she, ""such a stranger here,

ííííThat the guest's approach they could not name?Ah, they keep me in my cloister drear,

ííííWell nigh feel I vanquish'd by my shame.

ííííOn thy soft couch now

ííííSlumber calmly thou!

ííííI'll return as swiftly as I came.""

íííí""Stay, thou fairest maiden!"" cries the boy,

ííííStarting from his couch with eager haste:""Here are Ceres', Bacchus' gifts of joy;

ííííAmor bringest thou, with beauty grac'd!

ííííThou art pale with fear!

ííííLoved one let us here

ííííProve the raptures the Immortals taste.""

íííí""Draw not nigh, O Youth! afar remain!

ííííRapture now can never smile on me;For the fatal step, alas! is ta'en,

ííííThrough my mother's sick-bed phantasy.

ííííCured, she made this oath:

íííí'Youth and nature both

ííííShall henceforth to Heav'n devoted be.'

íííí""From the house, so silent now, are driven

ííííAll the gods who reign'd supreme of yore;One Invisible now rules in heaven,

ííííOn the cross a Saviour they adore.

ííííVictims slay they here,

ííííNeither lamb nor steer,But the altars reek with human gore.""

ííííAnd he lists, and ev'ry word he weighs,

ííííWhile his eager soul drinks in each sound:""Can it be that now before my gaze

ííííStands my loved one on this silent ground?

ííííPledge to me thy troth!

ííííThrough our father's oath:

ííííWith Heav'ns blessing will our love be crown'd.""

íííí""Kindly youth, I never can be thine!

íííí'Tis my sister they intend for thee.When I in the silent cloister pine,

ííííAh, within her arms remember me!

ííííThee alone I love,

ííííWhile love's pangs I prove;

ííííSoon the earth will veil my misery.""

íííí""No! for by this glowing flame I swear,

ííííHymen hath himself propitious shown:Let us to my fathers house repair,

ííííAnd thoult find that joy is not yet flown,

ííííSweetest, here then stay,

ííííAnd without delay

ííííHold we now our wedding feast alone!""

ííííThen exchange they tokens of their truth;

ííííShe gives him a golden chain to wear,And a silver chalice would the youth

ííííGive her in return of beauty rare.

íííí""That is not for me;

ííííYet I beg of thee,One lock only give me of thy hair.""

ííííNow the ghostly hour of midnight knell'd,

ííííAnd she seem'd right joyous at the sign;To her pallid lips the cup she held,

ííííBut she drank of nought but blood-red wine.

ííííFor to taste the bread

ííííThere before them spread,

ííííNought he spoke could make the maid incline.

ííííTo the youth the goblet then she brought,--

ííííHe too quaff'd with eager joy the bowl.Love to crown the silent feast he sought,

ííííAh! full love-sick was the stripling's soul.

ííííFrom his prayer she shrinks,

ííííTill at length he sinks

ííííOn the bed and weeps without control.

ííííAnd she comes, and lays her near the boy:

íííí""How I grieve to see thee sorrowing so!If thou think'st to clasp my form with joy,

ííííThou must learn this secret sad to know;

ííííYes! the maid, whom thou

ííííCall'st thy loved one now,

ííííIs as cold as ice, though white as snow.""

ííííThen he clasps her madly in his arm,

ííííWhile love's youthful might pervades his frame:""Thou might'st hope, when with me, to grow warm,

ííííE'en if from the grave thy spirit came!

ííííBreath for breath, and kiss!

ííííOverflow of bliss!

ííííDost not thou, like me, feel passion's flame?""

ííííLove still closer rivets now their lips,

ííííTears they mingle with their rapture blest,From his mouth the flame she wildly sips,

ííííEach is with the other's thought possess'd.

ííííHis hot ardour's flood

ííííWarms her chilly blood,

ííííBut no heart is beating in her breast.

ííííIn her care to see that nought went wrong,

ííííNow the mother happen'd to draw near;At the door long hearkens she, full long,

ííííWond'ring at the sounds that greet her ear.

ííííTones of joy and sadness,

ííííAnd love's blissful madness,

ííííAs of bride and bridegroom they appear,

ííííFrom the door she will not now remove

íííí'Till she gains full certainty of this;And with anger hears she vows of love,

ííííSoft caressing words of mutual bliss.

íííí""Hush! the cock's loud strain!

ííííBut thoult come again,

ííííWhen the night returns!""--then kiss on kiss.

ííííThen her wrath the mother cannot hold,

ííííBut unfastens straight the lock with ease""In this house are girls become so bold,

ííííAs to seek e'en strangers' lusts to please?""

ííííBy her lamp's clear glow

ííííLooks she in,--and oh!

ííííSight of horror!--'tis her child she sees.

ííííFain the youth would, in his first alarm,

ííííWith the veil that o'er her had been spread,With the carpet, shield his love from harm;

ííííBut she casts them from her, void of dread,

ííííAnd with spirit's strength,

ííííIn its spectre length,

ííííLifts her figure slowly from the bed.

íííí""Mother! mother!""--Thus her wan lips say:

íííí""May not I one night of rapture share?From the warm couch am I chased away?

ííííDo I waken only to despair?

ííííIt contents not thee

ííííTo have driven me

ííííAn untimely shroud of death to wear?

íííí""But from out my coffin's prison-bounds

ííííBy a wond'rous fate I'm forced to rove,While the blessings and the chaunting sounds

ííííThat your priests delight in, useless prove.

ííííWater, salt, are vain

ííííFervent youth to chain,

ííííAh, e'en Earth can never cool down love!

íííí""When that infant vow of love was spoken,

ííííVenus' radiant temple smiled on both.Mother! thou that promise since hast broken,

ííííFetter'd by a strange, deceitful oath.

ííííGods, though, hearken ne'er,

ííííShould a mother swear

ííííTo deny her daughter's plighted troth.

ííííFrom my grave to wander I am forc'd,

ííííStill to seek The Good's long-sever'd link,Still to love the bridegroom I have lost,

ííííAnd the life-blood of his heart to drink;

ííííWhen his race is run,

ííííI must hasten on,

ííííAnd the young must 'neath my vengeance sink,

íííí""Beauteous youth! no longer mayst thou live;

ííííHere must shrivel up thy form so fair;Did not I to thee a token give,

ííííTaking in return this lock of hair?

ííííView it to thy sorrow!

ííííGrey thoult be to-morrow,

ííííOnly to grow brown again when there.

íííí""Mother, to this final prayer give ear!

ííííLet a funeral pile be straightway dress'd;Open then my cell so sad and drear,

ííííThat the flames may give the lovers rest!

ííííWhen ascends the fire

ííííFrom the glowing pyre,

ííííTo the gods of old we'll hasten, blest.""

íííí1797.-----THE GOD AND THE BAYADERE.

ííííAN INDIAN LEGEND.

íííí[This very fine Ballad was also first given in the Horen.](MAHADEVA is one of the numerous names of Seeva, the destroyer,--the great god of the Brahmins.)

ííííMAHADEVA,* Lord of earth

ííííFor the sixth time comes below,

ííííAs a man of mortal birth,--

ííííLike him, feeling joy and woe.

ííííHither loves he to repair,

ííííAnd his power behind to leave;

ííííIf to punish or to spare,

ííííMen as man he'd fain perceive.And when he the town as a trav'ller hath seen,Observing the mighty, regarding the mean,He quits it, to go on his journey, at eve.

ííííHe was leaving now the place,

ííííWhen an outcast met his eyes,--

ííííFair in form, with painted face,--

ííííWhere some straggling dwellings rise.

íííí""Maiden, hail!""--""Thanks! welcome here!

ííííStay!--I'll join thee in the road.'

íííí""Who art thou?""--""A Bayadere,

ííííAnd this house is love's abode.""The cymbal she hastens to play for the dance,Well skill'd in its mazes the sight to entrance,Then by her with grace is the nosegay bestow'd.

ííííThen she draws him, as in play,

ííííO'er the threshold eagerly:

íííí""Beauteous stranger, light as day

ííííThou shalt soon this cottage see.

ííííI'll refresh thee, if thou'rt tired,

ííííAnd will bathe thy weary feet;

ííííTake whate'er by thee's desired,

ííííToying, rest, or rapture sweet.""--She busily seeks his feign'd suff'rings to ease;Then smiles the Immortal; with pleasure he seesThat with kindness a heart so corrupted can beat.

ííííAnd he makes her act the part

ííííOf a slave; he's straight obey'd.

ííííWhat at first had been but art,

ííííSoon is nature in the maid.

ííííBy degrees the fruit we find,

ííííWhere the buds at first obtain;

ííííWhen obedience fills the mind,

ííííLove will never far remain.But sharper and sharper the maiden to prove,The Discerner of all things below and above,Feigns pleasure, and horror, and maddening pain.

ííííAnd her painted cheeks he kisses,

ííííAnd his vows her heart enthrall;

ííííFeeling love's sharp pangs and blisses,

ííííSoon her tears begin to fall.

ííííAt his feet she now must sink,

ííííNot with thoughts of lust or gain,--

ííííAnd her slender members shrink,

ííííAnd devoid of power remain.And so the bright hours with gladness prepareTheir dark, pleasing veil of a texture so fair,And over the couch softly, tranquilly reign.

ííííLate she falls asleep, thus bless'd,--

ííííEarly wakes, her slumbers fled,

ííííAnd she finds the much-loved guest

ííííOn her bosom lying dead.

ííííScreaming falls she on him there,

ííííBut, alas, too late to save!

ííííAnd his rigid limbs they bear

ííííStraightway to their fiery grave.Then hears she the priests and the funeral song,Then madly she runs, and she severs the throng:""Why press tow'rd the pile thus? Why scream thus, and rave?""

ííííThen she sinks beside his bier,

ííííAnd her screams through air resound:

íííí""I must seek my spouse so dear,

ííííE'en if in the grave he's bound.

ííííShall those limbs of grace divine

ííííFall to ashes in my sight?

ííííMine he was! Yes, only mine!

ííííAh, one single blissful night!""The priests chaunt in chorus: ""We bear out the old,When long they've been weary, and late they've grown cold:We bear out the young, too, so thoughtless and light.

íííí""To thy priests' commands give ear!

ííííThis one was thy husband ne'er;

ííííLive still as a Bayadere,

ííííAnd no duty thou need'st share.

ííííTo deaths silent realms from life,

ííííNone but shades attend man's frame,

ííííWith the husband, none but wife,--

ííííThat is duty, that is fame.Ye trumpets, your sacred lament haste to raiseOh, welcome, ye gods, the bright lustre of days!Oh, welcome to heaven the youth from the flame!""

ííííThus increased her torments are

ííííBy the cruel, heartless quire;

ííííAnd with arms outstretching far

ííííLeaps she on the glowing pyre.

ííííBut the youth divine outsprings

ííííFrom the flame with heav'nly grace,

ííííAnd on high his flight he wings,

ííííWhile his arms his love embrace.In the sinner repentant the Godhead feels joy;Immortals delight thus their might to employ.Lost children to raise to a heavenly place.

íííí1797.-----THE PARIAH.

ííííI.  THE PARIAH S PRAYER.

ííííDREADED Brama, lord of might!

ííííAll proceed from thee alone;Thou art he who judgeth right!

ííííDost thou none but Brahmins own?Do but Rajahs come from thee?

ííííNone but those of high estate?

ííííDidst not thou the ape create,Aye, and even such as we?

ííííWe are not of noble kind,

ííííFor with woe our lot is rife;And what others deadly find

ííííIs our only source of life.Let this be enough for men,

ííííLet them, if they will, despise us;

ííííBut thou, Brama, thou shouldst prize us,All are equal in thy ken.

ííííNow that, Lord, this prayer is said,

ííííAs thy child acknowledge me;Or let one be born in-stead,

ííííWho may link me on to thee!Didst not thou a Bayadere

ííííAs a goddess heavenward raise?

ííííAnd we too to swell thy praise,Such a miracle would hear.

íííí1821.-----II. LEGEND.

íííí[The successful manner in which Goethe employs the simplerhymeless trochaic metre in this and in many other Poems willperhaps be remarked by the reader.]

ííííWATER-FETCHING goes the nobleBrahmin's wife, so pure and lovely;He is honour'd, void of blemish.And of justice rigid, stern.Daily from the sacred riverBrings she back refreshments precious;--But where is the pail and pitcher?She of neither stands in need.For with pure heart, hands unsullied,She the water lifts, and rolls itTo a wondrous ball of crystalThis she bears with gladsome bosom,Modestly, with graceful motion,To her husband in the house.

ííííShe to-day at dawn of morningPraying comes to Ganges' waters,Bends her o'er the glassy surface--Sudden, in the waves reflected,Flying swiftly far above her,From the highest heavens descending,She discerns the beauteous formOf a youth divine, createdBy the God's primeval wisdomIn his own eternal breast.

ííííWhen she sees him, straightway feels sheWondrous, new, confused sensationsIn her inmost, deepest being;Fain she'd linger o'er the vision,Then repels it,--it returneth,--And, perplex'd, she bends her flood-wardsWith uncertain hands to draw it;But, alas, she draws no more!For the water's sacred billowsSeem to fly, to hasten from her;She but sees the fearful chasmOf a whirlpool black disclosed.

ííííArms drop down, and footsteps stumble,Can this be the pathway homewards?Shall she fly, or shall she tarry?Can she think, when thought and counsel,When assistance all are lost?So before her spouse appears she--On her looks he--look is judgment--Proudly on the sword he seizes,To the hill of death he drags her,Where delinquents' blood pays forfeit.What resistance could she offer?What excuses could she proffer,Guilty, knowing not her guilt?

ííííAnd with bloody sword returns he,Musing, to his silent dwelling,When his son before him stands:""Whose this blood? Oh, father! father!""""The delinquent woman's!""--""Never!For upon the sword it dries not,Like the blood of the delinquent;Fresh it flows, as from the wound.Mother! mother! hither hasten!Unjust never was my father,Tell me what he now hath done.""--""Silence! silence! hers the blood is!""""Whose, my father?""--""Silence! Silence!""""What! oh what! my mother's blood!What her crime? What did she? Answer!Now, the sword! the sword now hold I;Thou thy wife perchance might'st slaughter,But my mother might'st not slay!Through the flames the wife is ableHer beloved spouse to follow,And his dear and only motherThrough the sword her faithful son.""""Stay! oh stay!"" exclaim'd the father:""Yet 'tis time, so hasten, hasten!Join the head upon the body,With the sword then touch the figure,And, alive she'll follow thee.""

ííííHastening, he, with breathless wonder,Sees the bodies of two womenLying crosswise, and their heads too;Oh, what horror! which to choose!Then his mother's head he seizes,--Does not kiss it, deadly pale 'tis,--On the nearest headless bodyPuts it quickly, and then blessesWith the sword the pious work.Then the giant form uprises,--From the dear lips of his mother,Lips all god-like--changeless--blissful,Sound these words with horror fraught:""Son, oh son! what overhast'ning!Yonder is thy mother's body,Near it lies the impious headOf the woman who hath fallenVictim to the judgment-sword!To her body I am graftedBy thy hand for endless ages;Wise in counsel, wild in action,I shall be amongst the gods.E'en the heav'nly boy's own image,Though in eye and brow so lovely,Sinking downwards to the bosomMad and raging lust will stir.

íííí""'Twill return again for ever,Ever rising, ever sinking,Now obscured, and now transfigur'd,--So great Brama hath ordain'd.He 'twas sent the beauteous pinions,Radiant face and slender membersOf the only God-begotten,That I might be proved and tempted;For from high descends temptation,When the gods ordain it so.And so I, the Brahmin woman,With my head in Heaven reclining,Must experience, as a Pariah,The debasing power of earth.

ííííSon, I send thee to thy father!Comfort him! Let no sad penance,Weak delay, or thought of merit,Hold thee in the desert fastWander on through ev'ry nation,Roam abroad throughout all ages,And proclaim to e'en the meanest,That great Brama hears his cry!

íííí""None is in his eyes the meanest--He whose limbs are lame and palsied,He whose soul is wildly riven,Worn with sorrow, hopeless, helpless,Be he Brahmin, be he Pariah,If tow'rd heaven he turns his gaze,Will perceive, will learn to know it:Thousand eyes are glowing yonder,Thousand ears are calmly list'ning,From which nought below is hid.

íííí""If I to his throne soar upward,If he sees my fearful figureBy his might transform'd to horror,He for ever will lament it,--May it to your good be found!And I now will kindly warn him,And I now will madly tell himWhatsoe'er my mind conceiveth,What within my bosom heaveth.But my thoughts, my inmost feelings--Those a secret shall remain.""

íííí1821.-----III.  THE PARIAH'S THANKS.

ííííMIGHTY Brama, now I'll bless thee!

íííí'Tis from thee that worlds proceed!As my ruler I confess thee,

ííííFor of all thou takest heed.

ííííAll thy thousand ears thou keepest

ííííOpen to each child of earth;We, 'mongst mortals sunk the deepest,

ííííHave from thee received new birth.

ííííBear in mind the woman's story,

ííííWho, through grief, divine became;Now I'll wait to view His glory,

ííííWho omnipotence can claim.

íííí1821.-----DEATH-LAMENT OF THE NOBLE WIFE OF ASAN AGA.

íííí[From the Morlack.)

ííííWHAT is yonder white thing in the forest?Is it snow, or can it swans perchance be?Were it snow, ere this it had been melted,Were it swans, they all away had hastend.Snow, in truth, it is not, swans it is not,'Tis the shining tents of Asan Aga.He within is lying, sorely wounded;To him come his mother and his sister;Bashfully his wife delays to come there.When the torment of his wounds had lessen'd,To his faithful wife he sent this message:""At my court no longer dare to tarry,At my court, or e'en amongst my people.""

ííííWhen the woman heard this cruel message,Mute and full of sorrow stood that true one.At the doors she hears the feet of horses,And bethinks that Asan comes--her husband,To the tower she springs, to leap thence headlong,Her two darling daughters follow sadly,And whilst weeping bitter tears, exclaim they:These are not our father Asan's horses;'Tis thy brother Pintorowich coming!""

ííííSo the wife of Asan turns to meet him,Clasps her arms in anguish round her brother:""See thy sister's sad disgrace, oh brother!How I'm banish'd--mother of five children!""Silently her brother from his wallet,Wrapp'd in deep red-silk, and ready written,Draweth forth the letter of divorcement,To return home to her mother's dwelling,Free to be another's wife thenceforward.

ííííWhen the woman saw that mournful letter,Fervently she kiss'd her two sons' foreheads,And her two girls' cheeks with fervour kiss'd she,But she from the suckling in the cradleCould not tear herself, so deep her sorrow!So she's torn thence by her fiery brother,On his nimble steed he lifts her quickly,And so hastens, with the heart-sad woman,Straightway tow'rd his father's lofty dwelling.

ííííShort the time was--seven days had pass'd not,--Yet enough 'twas; many mighty princesSought the woman in her widow's-mourning.Sought the woman,--as their wife they sought her.And the mightiest was Imoski's Cadi,And the woman weeping begg'd her brother:By thy life, my brother, I entreat thee,Let me not another's wife be ever,Lest my heart be broken at the imageOf my poor, my dearly-cherish'd children!""

ííííTo her prayer her brother would not hearken,Fix'd to wed her to Imoski's Cadi.Yet the good one ceaselessly implored him:""Send, at least a letter, oh, my brother,With this message to Imoski's Cadi:'The young widow sends thee friendly greeting;Earnestly she prays thee, through this letter,That, when thou com'st hither, with thy Suatians,A long veil thou'lt bring me, 'neath whose shadowI may hide, when near the house of Asan,And not see my dearly cherish'd orphans.'""

ííííScarcely had the Cadi read this letter,Than he gather'd all his Suatians round him,And then tow'rd the bride his course directed,And the veil she ask'd for, took he with him.

ííííHappily they reach'd the princess' dwelling,From the dwelling happily they led her.But when they approach'd the house of Asan,Lo! the children saw from high their mother,And they shouted: ""To thy halls return thou!Eat thy supper with thy darling children!""Mournfully the wife of Asan heard it,Tow'rd the Suatian prince then turn'd she, saying:""Let, I pray, the Suatians and the horsesAt the loved ones' door a short time tarry,That I may give presents to my children.""

ííííAnd before the loved ones' door they tarried,And she presents gave to her poor children,To the boys gave gold-embroider'd buskins,To the girls gave long and costly dresses,To the suckling, helpless in the cradle,Gave a garment, to be worn hereafter.

ííííThis aside saw Father Asan Aga,--Sadly cried he to his darling children:""Hither come, ye dear unhappy infants,For your mother's breast is turn'd to iron,Lock'd for ever, closed to all compassion!""

ííííWhen the wife of Asan heard him speak thus,On the ground, all pale and trembling, fell she,And her spirit fled her sorrowing bosom,When she saw her children flying from her.

ííííCANTATAS.

íííí-----May the bard these numbers praise,That are sung his fame to raise.-----

ííííTHE Poems composed by Goethe under this title are five innumber, of which three are here given. The other two are entirelypersonal in their allusions, and not of general interest. One ofthem is a Requiem on the Prince de Ligne, who died in 1814, andwhom Goethe calls ""the happiest man of the century,"" and theother was composed in honour of the 70th birthday of his friendZelter the composer, when Goethe was himself more than 79 (1828).The following sweet aria introduced in the latter is, however,worth giving:--

ííííTHE flowers so carefully rear'd,

ííííIn a garland for him I oft twin'd:How sweet have they ever appear'd,

ííííWhen wreath'd for a friend dear and kind.Then incense sweet ascended,

ííííThen new-horn blossoms rose,With gentle zephyrs blended

ííííIn tones of soft repose.-----IDYLL.

ííííA village Chorus is supposed to be assembled, and about tocommence its festive procession.

íííí[Written for the birthday of the Duchess Louisa of Weimar.]

ííííCHORUS.

ííííTHE festal day hail ye

ííííWith garlands of pleasure,

ííííAnd dances' soft measure,With rapture commingledAnd sweet choral song.

ííííDAMON.

ííííOh, how I yearn from out the crowd to flee!What joy a secret glade would give to me!Amid the throng, the turmoil here,Confined the plain, the breezes e'en appear.

ííííCHORUS.

ííííNow order it truly,That ev'ry one dulyMay roam and may wander,Now here, and now yonder,

ííííThe meadows along.

íííí[The Chorus retreats gradually, and the song becomes fainter andfainter, till it dies away in the distance.]

ííííDAMON.

ííííIn vain ye call, in vain would lure me on;True my heart speaks,--but with itself alone.

ííííAnd if I may view

ííííA blessing-fraught land,

ííííThe heaven's clear blue,

ííííAnd the plain's verdant hue,

ííííAlone I'll rejoice,

ííííUndisturbed by man's voice.

ííííAnd there I'll pay homage

ííííTo womanly merit,

ííííObserve it in spirit,

ííííIn spirit pay homage;

ííííTo echo alone

ííííShall my secret be known.

ííííCHORUS.

íííí[Faintly mingling with Damon's song in the distance.]

ííííTo echo--alone--

ííííShall my secret--be known.--

ííííMENALCAS.

ííííMy friend, why meet I here with thee?

ííííThou hast'nest not to join the festal throng?No longer stay, but come with me,

ííííAnd mingle in the dance and song.

ííííDAMON.

ííííThou'rt welcome, friend! but suffer me to roam

ííííWhere these old beeches hide me from man's view:Love seeks in solitude a home,

ííííAnd homage may retreat there too.

ííííMENALCAS.

ííííThou seekest here a spurious fame,

ííííAnd hast a mind to-day to grieve me.Love as thy portion thou mayst claim

ííííBut homage thou must share with all, believe me!

ííííWhen their voices thousands raise,And the dawn of morning praise,

ííííRapture bringing,

ííííBlithely singing

ííííOn before us,Heart and ear in pleasure vie;

ííííAnd when thousands join in chorus,

ííííWith the feelings brightly glowing,

ííííAnd the wishes overflowing,Forcibly they'll bear thee high.

íííí[The Chorus gradually approaches, from the distance.]

ííííDAMON.

ííííDistant strains are hither wending,

ííííAnd I'm gladden'd by the throng;Yes, they're coming,--yes, descending

ííííTo the valley from the height,

ííííMENALCAS.

ííííLet us haste, our footsteps blending

ííííWith the rhythm of the song!Yes, they come; their course they're bending

ííííTow'rd the wood's green sward so bright.

ííííCHORUS.[Gradually becoming louder.]

ííííYes, we hither come, attending

ííííWith the harmony of song,As the hours their race are ending

ííííOn this day of blest delight.

ííííALL.

ííííLet none revealThe thoughts we feel,The aims we own!Let joy alone

ííííDisclose the story!She'll prove it rightAnd her delight

ííííIncludes the glory,Includes the blissOf days like this!

íííí1813.-----RINALDO.*

íííí[This Cantata was written for Prince Frederick of Gotha, and setto music by Winter, the Prince singing the part of Rinaldo.--Seethe Annalen.]

íííí(* See Tasso's Gerusalemme Liberata, Canto XVI.)

ííííCHORUS.

ííííTo the strand! quick, mount the bark!

ííííIf no favouring zephyrs blow,

ííííPly the oar and nimbly row,And with zeal your prowess mark!

ííííO'er the sea we thus career.

ííííRINALDO.

ííííOh, let me linger one short moment here!'Tis heaven's decree, I may not hence away.The rugged cliffs, the wood-encircled bay,Hold me a prisoner, and my flight delay.

ííííYe were so fair, but now that dream is o'er;The charms of earth, the charms of heaven are nought.What keeps me in this spot so terror-fraught?

ííííMy only joy is fled for evermore.

ííííLet me taste those days so sweet,

ííííHeav'n-descended, once again!Heart, dear heart! ay, warmly beat!

ííííSpirit true, recall those days

ííííFreeborn breath thy gentle lays

ííííMingled are with joy and pain.

ííííRound the beds, so richly gleaming,

ííííRises up a palace fair;All with rosy fragrance teeming,

ííííAs in dream thou saw'st it ne'er.

ííííAnd this spacious garden round,

ííííFar extend the galleries;Roses blossom near the ground,

ííííHigh in air, too, bloom the trees.

ííííWat'ry flakes and jets are falling.

ííííSweet and silv'ry strains arise;While the turtle-dove is calling,

ííííAnd the nightingale replies.

ííííCHORUS.

ííííGently come! feel no alarm,

ííííOn a noble duty bent;Vanish'd now is ev'ry charm

ííííThat by magic power was lent.Friendly words and greetings calmOn his wounds will pour soft balm.

ííííFill his mind with sweet content.

ííííRINALDO.

ííííHark! the turtle-dove is calling,

ííííAnd the nightingale replies;Wat'ry flakes and jets are falling,

ííííMingling with their melodies.

ííííBut all of them say:

ííííHer only we mean;But all fly away,

ííííAs soon as she's seen,--The beauteous young maiden,

ííííWith graces so rife,

ííííThen lily and rose

ííííIn wreaths are entwining;

ííííIn dancing combining,Each zephyr that blows

ííííIts brother is greeting,

ííííAll flying and meeting,With balsam full laden,

ííííWhen waken'd to life.

ííííCHORUS.

ííííNo! no longer may we wait;Rouse him from his vision straight!Show the adamantine shield!

ííííRINALDO.

ííííWoe! what form is here reveal'd!

ííííCHORUS.

íííí'Twill disclose the cheat to thee.

ííííRINALDO.

ííííAm I doom'd myself to seeThus degraded evermore?

ííííCHORUS.

ííííCourage take, and all is o'er.

ííííRINALDO.

ííííBe it so! I'll take fresh heart,From the spot beloved depart,Leave Armida once again,--Come then! here no more remain.

ííííCHORUS.

ííííYes, 'tis well! no more remain.

ííííSEMI-CHORUS.

ííííAway then! let's fly

ííííO'er the zephyr-kiss'd ocean!The soul-lighted eye

ííííSees armies in motion,See proud banners wave

ííííO'er the dust-sprinkled course.

ííííCHORUS.

ííííFrom his forefathers brave

ííííDraws the hero new force.

ííííRINALDO.

ííííWith sorrow laden,

ííííWithin this valley's

ííííAll-silent alleysThe fairest maiden

ííííAgain I see.

ííííTwice can this be?What! shall I hear it,And not have spiritTo ease her pains?

ííííCHORUS.

ííííUnworthy chains?

ííííRINALDO.

ííííAnd now I've see her,

ííííAlas! how changed!With cold demeanour.

ííííAnd looks estranged,With ghostly tread,--All hope is fled,Yes, fled for ever.The lightnings quiver,Each palace falls;The godlike halls,Each joyous hourOf spirit-power,With love's sweet dayAll fade away!

ííííCHORUS.

ííííYes, fade away!

ííííSEMI-CHORUS.

ííííAlready are heard

ííííThe prayers of the pious.

ííííWhy longer deny us?The favouring zephyr

ííííForbids all delay.

ííííCHORUS.

ííííAway, then! away!

ííííRINALDO.

ííííWith heart sadly stirr'd,

ííííYour command I receive;

ííííYe force me to leave.Unkind is the zephyr,--

ííííOh, wherefore not stay?

ííííCHORUS.

ííííAway, then! away!

íííí1811.-----THE FIRST WALPURGIS-NIGHT.

ííííA DRUID.

ííííSWEET smiles the May!

ííííThe forest gay

ííííFrom frost and ice is freed;

ííííNo snow is found,

ííííGlad songs resound

ííííAcross the verdant mead.

ííííUpon the height

ííííThe snow lies light,

ííííYet thither now we go,There to extol our Father's name,

ííííWhom we for ages know.Amid the smoke shall gleam the flame;

ííííThus pure the heart will grow.

ííííTHE DRUIDS.

ííííAmid the smoke shall gleam the flame;Extol we now our Father's name,

ííííWhom we for ages know!

ííííUp, up, then, let us go!

ííííONE OF THE PEOPLE.

ííííWould ye, then, so rashly act?Would ye instant death attract?Know ye not the cruel threats

ííííOf the victors we obey?Round about are placed their nets

ííííIn the sinful heathen's way.Ah! upon the lofty wall

ííííWife and children slaughter they;And we allHasten to a certain fall.

ííííCHORUS OF WOMEN.

ííííAy, upon the camp's high wall

ííííAll our children loved they slay.

ííííAh, what cruel victors they!And we allHasten to a certain fall.

ííííA DRUID.

ííííWho fears to-day

ííííHis rites to pay,

ííííDeserves his chains to wear.

ííííThe forest's free!

ííííThis wood take we,

ííííAnd straight a pile prepare!

ííííYet in the wood

ííííTo stay 'tis good

ííííBy day, till all is still,With watchers all around us plac'd

ííííProtecting you from ill.With courage fresh, then let us haste

ííííOur duties to fulfil.

ííííCHORUS OF WATCHERS.

ííííYe valiant watchers, now divideYour numbers through the forest wide,

ííííAnd see that all is still,

ííííWhile they their rites fulfil.

ííííA WATCHER.

ííííLet us in a cunning wise,Yon dull Christian priests surpriseWith the devil of their talk

ííííWe'll those very priests confound.Come with prong, and come with fork.

ííííRaise a wild and rattling soundThrough the livelong night, and prowl

ííííAll the rocky passes round.Screechowl, owl,Join in chorus with our howl!

ííííCHORUS OF WATCHERS.

ííííCome with prong, and come with fork,Like the devil of their talk,And with wildly rattling sound,Prowl the desert rocks around!Screechowl, owl,Join in chorus with our howl!

ííííA DRUID.

ííííThus far 'tis right.

ííííThat we by night

ííííOur Father's praises sing;

ííííYet when 'tis day,

ííííTo Thee we may

ííííA heart unsullied bring.

íííí'Tis true that now,

ííííAnd often, Thou

ííííFav'rest the foe in fight.As from the smoke is freed the blaze,

ííííSo let our faith burn bright!And if they crush our golden ways,

ííííWho e'er can crush Thy light?

ííííA CHRISTIAN WATCHER.

ííííComrades, quick! your aid afford!All the brood of hell's abroad;See how their enchanted forms

ííííThrough and through with flames are glowing!Dragon-women, men-wolf swarms,

ííííOn in quick succession going!Let us, let us haste to fly!

ííííWilder yet the sounds are growing,And the archfiend roars on high;From the groundHellish vapours rise around.

ííííCHORUS OF CHRISTIAN WATCHERS.

ííííTerrible enchanted forms,Dragon-women, men-wolf swarms!Wilder yet the sounds are growing!See, the archfiend comes, all-glowing!From the groundHellish vapours rise around!

ííííCHORUS OF DRUIDS.

ííííAs from the smoke is freed the blaze,

ííííSo let our faith burn bright!And if they crush our golden ways,

ííííWho e'er can crush Thy light?

íííí1799.-----

ííííODES.

íííí-----

ííííTHESE are the most singular of all the Poems of Goethe, and tomany will appear so wild and fantastic, as to leave anything buta pleasing impression. Those at the beginning, addressed to hisfriend Behrisch, were written at the age of eighteen, and most ofthe remainder were composed while he was still quite young.Despite, however, the extravagance of some of them, such as theWinter Journey over the Hartz Mountains, and the Wanderer'sStorm-Song, nothing can be finer than the noble one entitledMahomet's Song, and others, such as the Spirit Song' over theWaters, The God-like, and, above all, the magnificent sketch ofPrometheus, which forms part of an unfinished piece bearing thesame name, and called by Goethe a 'Dramatic Fragment.'

ííííTO MY FRIEND.

íííí[These three Odes are addressed to a certain Behrisch, who wastutor to Count Lindenau, and of whom Goethe gives an odd accountat the end of the Seventh Book of his Autobiography.]

ííííFIRST ODE.

ííííTRANSPLANT the beauteous tree!Gardener, it gives me pain;A happier resting-placeIts trunk deserved.

ííííYet the strength of its natureTo Earth's exhausting avarice,To Air's destructive inroads,An antidote opposed.

ííííSee how it in springtimeCoins its pale green leaves!Their orange-fragrancePoisons each flyblow straight.

ííííThe caterpillar's toothIs blunted by them;With silv'ry hues they gleamIn the bright sunshine,

ííííIts twigs the maidenFain would twine inHer bridal-garland;Youths its fruit are seeking.

ííííSee, the autumn cometh!The caterpillarSighs to the crafty spider,--Sighs that the tree will not fade.

ííííHov'ring thitherFrom out her yew-tree dwelling,The gaudy foe advancesAgainst the kindly tree,

ííííAnd cannot hurt it,But the more artful oneDefiles with nauseous venomIts silver leaves;

ííííAnd sees with triumphHow the maiden shudders,The youth, how mourns he,On passing by.

ííííTransplant the beauteous tree!Gardener, it gives me pain;Tree, thank the gardenerWho moves thee hence!

íííí1767.-----SECOND ODE.

ííííTHOU go'st! I murmur--Go! let me murmur.Oh, worthy man,Fly from this land!

ííííDeadly marshes,Steaming mists of OctoberHere interweave their currents,Blending for ever.

ííííNoisome insectsHere are engender'd;Fatal darknessVeils their malice.

ííííThe fiery-tongued serpent,Hard by the sedgy bank,Stretches his pamper'd body,Caress'd by the sun's bright beams.

ííííTempt no gentle night-ramblesUnder the moon's cold twilight!Loathsome toads hold their meetingsYonder at every crossway.

ííííInjuring not,Fear will they cause thee.Oh, worthy man,Fly from this land!

íííí1767.-----THIRD ODE.

ííííBE void of feeling!A heart that soon is stirr'd,Is a possession sadUpon this changing earth.

ííííBehrisch, let spring's sweet smileNever gladden thy brow!Then winter's gloomy tempestsNever will shadow it o'er.

ííííLean thyself ne'er on a maiden'sSorrow-engendering breast.Ne'er on the arm,Misery-fraught, of a friend.

ííííAlready envyFrom out his rocky ambushUpon thee turnsThe force of his lynx-like eyes,

ííííStretches his talons,On thee falls,In thy shouldersCunningly plants them.

ííííStrong are his skinny arms,As panther-claws;He shaketh thee,And rends thy frame.

ííííDeath 'tis to part,'Tis threefold deathTo part, not hopingEver to meet again.

ííííThou wouldst rejoice to leaveThis hated land behind,Wert thou not chain'd to meWith friendships flowery chains.

ííííBurst them! I'll not repine.No noble friendWould stay his fellow-captive,If means of flight appear.

ííííThe remembranceOf his dear friend's freedomGives him freedomIn his dungeon.

ííííThou go'st,--I'm left.But e'en alreadyThe last year's winged spokesWhirl round the smoking axle.

ííííI number the turnsOf the thundering wheel;The last one I bless.--Each bar then is broken, I'm free then as thou!

íííí1767.-----MAHOMET'S SONG.

íííí[This song was intended to be introduced in a dramatic poementitled Mahomet, the plan of which was not carried out byGoethe. He mentions that it was to have been sung by Ali towardsthe end of the piece, in honor of his master, Mahomet, shortlybefore his death, and when at the height of his glory, of whichit is typical.]

ííííSEE the rock-born stream!Like the gleamOf a star so brightKindly spiritsHigh above the cloudsNourished him while youthfulIn the copse between the cliffs.

ííííYoung and fresh.From the clouds he dancethDown upon the marble rocks;Then tow'rd heavenLeaps exulting.

ííííThrough the mountain-passesChaseth he the colour'd pebbles,And, advancing like a chief,Tears his brother streamlets with himIn his course.

ííííIn the valley down below'Neath his footsteps spring the flowers,And the meadowIn his breath finds life.

ííííYet no shady vale can stay him,Nor can flowers,Round his knees all-softly twiningWith their loving eyes detain him;To the plain his course he taketh,Serpent-winding,

ííííSocial streamletsJoin his waters. And now moves heO'er the plain in silv'ry glory,And the plain in him exults,And the rivers from the plain,And the streamlets from the mountain,Shout with joy, exclaiming: ""Brother,Brother, take thy brethren with thee,With thee to thine aged father,To the everlasting ocean,Who, with arms outstretching far,Waiteth for us;Ah, in vain those arms lie openTo embrace his yearning children;For the thirsty sand consumes usIn the desert waste; the sunbeamsDrink our life-blood; hills around usInto lakes would dam us! Brother,Take thy brethren of the plain,Take thy brethren of the mountainWith thee, to thy father's arms!

ííííLet all come, then!--And now swells heLordlier still; yea, e'en a peopleBears his regal flood on high!And in triumph onward rolling,Names to countries gives he,--citiesSpring to light beneath his foot.

ííííEver, ever, on he rushes,Leaves the towers' flame-tipp'd summits,Marble palaces, the offspringOf his fullness, far behind.

ííííCedar-houses bears the AtlasOn his giant shoulders; flutt'ringIn the breeze far, far above himThousand flags are gaily floating,Bearing witness to his might.

ííííAnd so beareth he his brethren,All his treasures, all his children,Wildly shouting, to the bosomOf his long-expectant sire.

íííí1774.-----SPIRIT SONG OVER THE WATERS.

ííííTHE soul of manResembleth water:From heaven it cometh,To heaven it soareth.And then againTo earth descendeth,Changing ever.

ííííDown from the loftyRocky wallStreams the bright flood,Then spreadeth gentlyIn cloudy billowsO'er the smooth rock,And welcomed kindly,Veiling, on roams it,Soft murmuring,Tow'rd the abyss.

ííííCliffs projectingOppose its progress,--Angrily foams itDown to the bottom,Step by step.

ííííNow, in flat channel,Through the meadowland steals it,And in the polish'd lakeEach constellationJoyously peepeth.

ííííWind is the lovingWooer of waters;Wind blends togetherBillows all-foaming.

ííííSpirit of man,Thou art like unto water!Fortune of man,Thou art like unto wind!

íííí1789.*-----MY GODDESS.

ííííSAY, which ImmortalMerits the highest reward?With none contend I,But I will give itTo the aye-changing,Ever-movingWondrous daughter of Jove.His best-beloved offspring.Sweet Phantasy.

ííííFor unto herHath he grantedAll the fancies which erstTo none allow'd heSaving himself;Now he takes his pleasureIn the mad one.

ííííShe may, crowned with roses,With staff twined round with lilies,Roam thro' flow'ry valleys,Rule the butterfly-people,And soft-nourishing dewWith bee-like lipsDrink from the blossom:

ííííOr else she mayWith fluttering hairAnd gloomy looksSigh in the windRound rocky cliffs,And thousand-hued.Like morn and even.Ever changing,Like moonbeam's light,To mortals appear.

ííííLet us all, then,Adore the Father!The old, the mighty,Who such a beauteousNe'er-fading spouseDeigns to accordTo perishing mortals!

ííííTo us aloneDoth he unite her,With heavenly bonds,While he commands her,in joy and sorrow,As a true spouseNever to fly us.

ííííAll the remainingRaces so poorOf life-teeming earth.In children so rich.Wander and feedIn vacant enjoyment,And 'mid the dark sorrowsOf evanescentRestricted life,--Bow'd by the heavyYoke of Necessity.

ííííBut unto us heHath his most versatile,Most cherished daughterGranted,--what joy!

ííííLovingly greet herAs a beloved one!Give her the woman'sPlace in our home!

ííííAnd oh, may the agedStepmother WisdomHer gentle spiritNe'er seek to harm!

ííííYet know I her sister,The older, sedater,Mine own silent friend;Oh, may she never,Till life's lamp is quench'd,Turn away from me,--That noble inciter,Comforter,--Hope!

íííí[The following explanation is necessary, in order to make thisode in any way intelligible. The Poet is supposed to leave hiscompanions, who are proceeding on a hunting expedition in winter,in order himself to pay a visit to a hypochondriacal friend, andalso to see the mining in the Hartz mountains. The odealternately describes, in a very fragmentary and peculiar manner,the naturally happy disposition of the Poet himself and theunhappiness of his friend; it pictures the wildness of the roadand the dreariness of the prospect, which is relieved at one spotby the distant sight of a town, a very vague allusion to which ismade in the third strophe; it recalls the hunting party on whichhis companions have gone; and after an address to Love, concludesby a contrast between the unexplored recesses of the highest peakof the Hartz and the metalliferous veins of its smallerbrethren.]

ííííLIKE the vultureWho on heavy morning cloudsWith gentle wing reposingLooks for his prey,--Hover, my song!

ííííFor a God hathUnto each prescribedHis destined path,Which the happy oneRuns o'er swiftlyTo his glad goal:He whose heart cruelFate hath contracted,Struggles but vainlyAgainst all the barriersThe brazen thread raises,But which the harsh shearsMust one day sever.

ííííThrough gloomy thicketsPresseth the wild deer on,And with the sparrowsLong have the wealthySettled themselves in the marsh.

ííííEasy 'tis following the chariotThat by Fortune is driven,Like the baggage that movesOver well-mended highwaysAfter the train of a prince.

ííííBut who stands there apart?In the thicket, lost is his path;Behind him the bushesAre closing together,The grass springs up again,The desert engulphs him.

ííííAh, who'll heal his afflictions,To whom balsam was poison,Who, from love's fullness,Drank in misanthropy only?First despised, and now a despiser,He, in secret, wastethAll that he is worth,In a selfishness vain.If there be, on thy psaltery,Father of Love, but one toneThat to his ear may be pleasing,Oh, then, quicken his heart!Clear his cloud-enveloped eyesOver the thousand fountainsClose by the thirsty oneIn the desert.

ííííThou who createst much joy,For each a measure o'erflowing,Bless the sons of the chaseWhen on the track of the prey,With a wild thirsting for blood,Youthful and joyousAvenging late the injusticeWhich the peasant resistedVainly for years with his staff.

ííííBut the lonely one veilWithin thy gold clouds!Surround with winter-green,Until the roses bloom again,The humid locks,Oh Love, of thy minstrel!

ííííWith thy glimmering torchLightest thou himThrough the fords when 'tis night,Over bottomless placesOn desert-like plains;With the thousand colours of morningGladd'nest his bosom;With the fierce-biting stormBearest him proudly on high;Winter torrents rush from the cliffs,--Blend with his psalms;An altar of grateful delightHe finds in the much-dreaded mountain'sSnow-begirded summit,Which foreboding nationsCrown'd with spirit-dances.

ííííThou stand'st with breast inscrutable,Mysteriously disclosed,High o'er the wondering world,And look'st from cloudsUpon its realms and its majesty,Which thou from the veins of thy brethrenNear thee dost water.

íííí1777.-----TO FATHER* KRONOS.

íííí[written in a post-chaise.]

íííí(* In the original, Schwager, which has the twofold meaning ofbrother-in-law and postilion.)

ííííHASTEN thee, Kronos!On with clattering trotDownhill goeth thy path;Loathsome dizziness ever,When thou delayest, assails me.Quick, rattle along,Over stock and stone let thy trotInto life straightway lead

ííííNow once moreUp the toilsome ascentHasten, panting for breath!Up, then, nor idle be,--Striving and hoping, up, up!

ííííWide, high, glorious the viewGazing round upon life,While from mount unto mountHovers the spirit eterne,Life eternal foreboding.

ííííSideways a roof's pleasant shadeAttracts thee,And a look that promises coolnessOn the maidenly threshold.There refresh thee! And, maiden,Give me this foaming draught also,Give me this health-laden look!

ííííDown, now! quicker still, down!See where the sun setsEre he sets, ere old ageSeizeth me in the morass,Ere my toothless jaws mumble,And my useless limbs totter;While drunk with his farewell beamHurl me,--a fiery seaFoaming still in mine eye,--Hurl me, while dazzled and reeling,Down to the gloomy portal of hell.

ííííBlow, then, gossip, thy horn,Speed on with echoing trot,So that Orcus may know we are coming;So that our host may with joyWait at the door to receive us.

íííí1774.-----THE WANDERER'S STORM-SONG.

íííí[Goethe says of this ode, that it is the only one remaining outof several strange hymns and dithyrambs composed by him at aperiod of great unhappiness, when the love-affair between him andFrederica had been broken off by him. He used to sing them whilewandering wildly about the country. This particular one wascaused by his being caught in a tremendous storm on one of theseoccasions. He calls it a half-crazy piece (halkunsinn), and thereader will probably agree with him.]

ííííHe whom thou ne'er leavest, Genius,Feels no dread within his heartAt the tempest or the rain.He whom thou ne'er leavest, Genius,Will to the rain-clouds,Will to the hailstorm,Sing in replyAs the lark sings,Oh thou on high!

ííííHim whom thou ne'er leavest, Genius,Thou wilt raise above the mud-trackWith thy fiery pinions.He will wander,As, with flowery feet,Over Deucalion's dark flood,Python-slaying, light, glorious,Pythius Apollo.

ííííHim whom thou ne'er leavest, Genius,Thou wilt place upon thy fleecy pinionWhen he sleepeth on the rock,--Thou wilt shelter with thy guardian wingIn the forest's midnight hour.

ííííHim whom thou ne'er leavest, Genius,Thou wilt wrap up warmlyIn the snow-drift;Tow'rd the warmth approach the Muses,Tow'rd the warmth approach the Graces.

ííííYe Muses, hover round me!Ye Graces also!That is water, that is earth,And the son of water and of earthOver which I wander,Like the gods.

ííííYe are pure, like the heart of the water,Ye are pure like the marrow of earth,Hov'ring round me, while I hoverOver water, o'er the earthLike the gods.

ííííShall he, then, return,The small, the dark, the fiery peasant?Shall he, then, return, waitingOnly thy gifts, oh Father Bromius,And brightly gleaming, warmth-spreading fire?Return with joy?And I, whom ye attended,Ye Muses and ye Graces,Whom all awaits that ye,Ye Muses and ye Graces,Of circling bliss in lifeHave glorified--shall IReturn dejected?

ííííFather Bromius!Thourt the Genius,Genius of ages,Thou'rt what inward glowTo Pindar was,What to the worldPhoebus Apollo.

ííííWoe! Woe Inward warmth,Spirit-warmth,Central-point!Glow, and vie withPhoebus Apollo!Coldly soonHis regal lookOver thee will swiftly glide,--

ííííEnvy-struckLinger o'er the cedar's strength,Which, to flourish,Waits him not.

ííííWhy doth my lay name thee the last?Thee, from whom it began,Thee, in whom it endeth,Thee, from whom it flows,Jupiter Pluvius!Tow'rd thee streams my song.And a Castalian springRuns as a fellow-brook,Runs to the idle ones,Mortal, happy ones,Apart from thee,Who cov'rest me around,Jupiter Pluvius!

ííííNot by the elm-treeHim didst thou visit,With the pair of dovesHeld in his gentle arm,--With the beauteous garland of roses,--Caressing him, so blest in his flowers,Anacreon,Storm-breathing godhead!Not in the poplar grove,Near the Sybaris' strand,Not on the mountain'sSun-illumined browDidst thou seize him,The flower-singing,Honey-breathing,Sweetly noddingTheocritus.

ííííWhen the wheels were rattling,Wheel on wheel tow'rd the goal,High aroseThe sound of the lashOf youths with victory glowing,In the dust rolling,As from the mountain fallShowers of stones in the vale--Then thy soul was brightly glowing, Pindar--Glowing? Poor heart!

ííííThere, on the hill,--Heavenly might!But enough glowThither to wend,Where is my cot!

íííí1771.-----THE SEA-VOYAGE.

ííííMANY a day and night my bark stood ready laden;Waiting fav'ring winds, I sat with true friends round me,Pledging me to patience and to courage,In the haven.

ííííAnd they spoke thus with impatience twofold:""Gladly pray we for thy rapid passage,Gladly for thy happy voyage; fortuneIn the distant world is waiting for thee,In our arms thoult find thy prize, and love too,When returning.""

ííííAnd when morning came, arose an uproar,And the sailors' joyous shouts awoke us;All was stirring, all was living, moving,Bent on sailing with the first kind zephyr.

ííííAnd the sails soon in the breeze are swelling,And the sun with fiery love invites us;Fill'd the sails are, clouds on high are floating,On the shore each friend exulting raisesSongs of hope, in giddy joy expectingJoy the voyage through, as on the morn of sailing,And the earliest starry nights so radiant.

ííííBut by God-sent changing winds ere long he's drivenSideways from the course he had intended,And he feigns as though he would surrender,While he gently striveth to outwit them,

ííííTo his goal, e'en when thus press'd, still faithful.But from out the damp grey distance rising,Softly now the storm proclaims its advent,Presseth down each bird upon the waters,Presseth down the throbbing hearts of mortals.And it cometh. At its stubborn fury,Wisely ev'ry sail the seaman striketh;With the anguish-laden ball are sportingWind and water.

ííííAnd on yonder shore are gather'd standing,Friends and lovers, trembling for the bold one:""Why, alas, remain'd he here not with us!Ah, the tempest! Cast away by fortune!Must the good one perish in this fashion?Might not he perchance.... Ye great immortals!""

ííííYet he, like a man, stands by his rudder;With the bark are sporting wind and water,Wind and water sport not with his bosom:On the fierce deep looks he, as a master,--In his gods, or shipwreck'd, or safe landed,Trusting ever.

íííí1776.-----THE EAGLE AND DOVE.

ííííIN search of prey once raised his pinionsAn eaglet;A huntsman's arrow came, and reftHis right wing of all motive power.Headlong he fell into a myrtle grove,For three long days on anguish fed,In torment writhedThroughout three long, three weary nights;And then was cured,Thanks to all-healing Nature'sSoft, omnipresent balm.He crept away from out the copse,And stretch'd his wing--alas!Lost is all power of flight--He scarce can lift himselfFrom off the groundTo catch some mean, unworthy prey,And rests, deep-sorrowing,On the low rock beside the stream.Up to the oak he looks,Looks up to heaven,While in his noble eye there gleams a tear.Then, rustling through the myrtle boughs, behold,There comes a wanton pair of doves,Who settle down, and, nodding, strutO'er the gold sands beside the stream,And gradually approach;Their red-tinged eyes, so full of love,Soon see the inward-sorrowing one.The male, inquisitively social, leapsOn the next bush, and looksUpon him kindly and complacently.""Thou sorrowest,"" murmurs he:""Be of good cheer, my friend!All that is needed for calm happinessHast thou not here?Hast thou not pleasure in the golden boughThat shields thee from the day's fierce glow?Canst thou not raise thy breast to catch,On the soft moss beside the brook,The sun's last rays at even?Here thou mayst wander through the flowers' fresh dew,Pluck from the overflowThe forest-trees provide,Thy choicest food,--mayst quenchThy light thirst at the silvery spring.Oh friend, true happinessLies in contentedness,And that contentednessFinds everywhere enough.""""Oh, wise one!"" said the eagle, while he sankIn deep and ever deep'ning thought--""Oh Wisdom! like a dove thou speakest!""

íííí1774.*-----PROMETHEUS.

ííííCOVER thy spacious heavens, Zeus,With clouds of mist,And, like the boy who lopsThe thistles' heads,Disport with oaks and mountain-peaks,Yet thou must leaveMy earth still standing;My cottage too, which was not raised by thee;Leave me my hearth,Whose kindly glowBy thee is envied.

ííííI know nought poorerUnder the sun, than ye gods!Ye nourish painfully,With sacrificesAnd votive prayers,Your majesty:Ye would e'en starve,If children and beggarsWere not trusting fools.

ííííWhile yet a childAnd ignorant of life,I turned my wandering gazeUp tow'rd the sun, as if with himThere were an ear to hear my wailings,A heart, like mine,To feel compassion for distress.

ííííWho help'd meAgainst the Titans' insolence?Who rescued me from certain death,From slavery?Didst thou not do all this thyself,My sacred glowing heart?And glowedst, young and good,Deceived with grateful thanksTo yonder slumbering one?

ííííI honour thee! and why?Hast thou e'er lighten'd the sorrowsOf the heavy laden?Hast thou e'er dried up the tearsOf the anguish-stricken?Was I not fashion'd to be a manBy omnipotent Time,And by eternal Fate,Masters of me and thee?

ííííDidst thou e'er fancyThat life I should learn to hate,And fly to deserts,Because not allMy blossoming dreams grew ripe?

ííííHere sit I, forming mortalsAfter my image;A race resembling me,To suffer, to weep,To enjoy, to be glad,And thee to scorn,As I!

íííí1773.-----GANYMEDE.

ííííHow, in the light of morning,Round me thou glowest,Spring, thou beloved one!With thousand-varying loving blissThe sacred emotionsBorn of thy warmth eternalPress 'gainst my bosom,Thou endlessly fair one!Could I but hold thee clasp'dWithin mine arms!

ííííAh! upon thy bosomLay I, pining,And then thy flowers, thy grass,Were pressing against my heart.Thou coolest the burningThirst of my bosom,Beauteous morning breeze!The nightingale then calls meSweetly from out of the misty vale.I come, I come!Whither? Ah, whither?

ííííUp, up, lies my course.While downward the cloudsAre hovering, the cloudsAre bending to meet yearning love.For me,Within thine armsUpwards!Embraced and embracing!Upwards into thy bosom,Oh Father all-loving!

íííí1789.*-----THE BOUNDARIES OF HUMANITY.

ííííWHEN the primevalAll-holy FatherSows with a tranquil handFrom clouds, as they roll,Bliss-spreading lightningsOver the earth,Then do I kiss the lastHem of his garment,While by a childlike aweFiil'd is my breast.

ííííFor with immortalsNe'er may a mortalMeasure himself.If he soar upwardsAnd if he touchWith his forehead the stars,Nowhere will rest thenHis insecure feet,And with him sportTempest and cloud.

ííííThough with firm sinewyLimbs he may standOn the enduringWell-grounded earth,All he is everAble to do,Is to resembleThe oak or the vine.

ííííWherein do godsDiffer from mortals?In that the formerSee endless billowsHeaving before them;Us doth the billowLift up and swallow,So that we perish.

ííííSmall is the ringEnclosing our life,And whole generationsLink themselves firmlyOn to existence'sChain never-ending.

íííí1789. *-----THE GODLIKE.

ííííNOBLE be man,Helpful and good!For that aloneDistinguisheth himFrom all the beingsUnto us known.

ííííHail to the beings,Unknown and glorious,Whom we forebode!From his exampleLearn we to know them!

ííííFor unfeelingNature is ever:On bad and on goodThe sun alike shineth;And on the wicked,As on the best,The moon and stars gleam.

ííííTempest and torrent,Thunder and hail,Roar on their path,Seizing the while,As they haste onward,One after another.

ííííEven so, fortuneGropes 'mid the throng--Innocent boyhood'sCurly head seizing,--Seizing the hoaryHead of the sinner.

ííííAfter laws mighty,Brazen, eternal,Must all we mortalsFinish the circuitOf our existence.

ííííMan, and man onlyCan do the impossible;He 'tis distinguisheth,Chooseth and judgeth;He to the momentEndurance can lend.

ííííHe and he onlyThe good can reward,The bad can he punish,Can heal and can save;All that wanders and straysCan usefully blend.And we pay homageTo the immortalsAs though they were men,And did in the great,What the best, in the small,Does or might do.

ííííBe the man that is noble,Both helpful and good.Unweariedly formingThe right and the useful,A type of those beingsOur mind hath foreshadow'd!

ííííMISCELLANEOUS POEMS.

íííí-----in the wares before you spread,Types of all things may be read.-----THE GERMAN PARNASSUS.

íííí'NEATH the shadow

ííííOf these bushes,On the meadow

ííííWhere the cooling water gushes.Phoebus gave me, when a boy,All life's fullness to enjoy.So, in silence, as the GodBade them with his sov'reign nod,Sacred Muses train'd my daysTo his praise.--With the bright and silv'ry floodOf Parnassus stirr'd my blood,And the seal so pure and chasteBy them on my lips was placed.

ííííWith her modest pinions, see,Philomel encircles me!In these bushes, in yon grove,

ííííCalls she to her sister-throng,

ííííAnd their heavenly choral songTeaches me to dream of love.

ííííFullness waxes in my breastOf emotions social, blest;Friendship's nurtured─love awakes,--And the silence Phoebus breaksOf his mountains, of his vales,Sweetly blow the balmy gales;All for whom he shows affection,Who are worthy his protection,Gladly follow his direction.

ííííThis one comes with joyous bearing

ííííAnd with open, radiant gaze;That a sterner look is wearing,This one, scarcely cured, with daring

ííííWakes the strength of former days;For the sweet, destructive flamePierced his marrow and his frame.That which Amor stole beforePhoebus only can restore,Peace, and joy, and harmony,Aspirations pure and free.

ííííBrethren, rise ye!Numbers prize ye!Deeds of worth resemble they.

ííííWho can better than the bardGuide a friend when gone astray?

ííííIf his duty he regard,More he'll do, than others may.

ííííYes! afar I hear them sing!Yes! I hear them touch the string,And with mighty godlike stroke

ííííRight and duty they inspire,And evoke,

ííííAs they sing, and wake the lyre,Tendencies of noblest worth,To each type of strength give birth.

ííííPhantasies of sweetest powerFlowerRound about on ev'ry bough,Bending nowLike the magic wood of old,'Neath the fruit that gleams like gold.

ííííWhat we feel and what we view

ííííIn the land of highest bliss,--

ííííThis dear soil, a sun like this,--Lures the best of women too.And the Muses' breathings blestRouse the maiden's gentle breast,Tune the throat to minstrelsy,And with cheeks of beauteous dye,Bid it sing a worthy song,Sit the sister-band among;And their strains grow softer still,As they vie with earnest will.

ííííOne amongst the band betimes

ííííGoes to wanderBy the beeches, 'neath the limes,

ííííYonder seeking, finding yonderThat which in the morning-groveShe had lost through roguish Love,All her breast's first aspirations,And her heart's calm meditations,To the shady wood so fair

ííííGently stealing,Takes she that which man can ne'er

ííííDuly merit,--each soft feeling,--Disregards the noontide rayAnd the dew at close of day,?

ííííIn the plain her path she loses.Ne'er disturb her on her way!

ííííSeek her silently, ye Muses

ííííShouts I hear, wherein the soundOf the waterfall is drown'd.From the grove loud clamours rise,Strange the tumult, strange the cries.See I rightly? Can it be?To the very sanctuary,Lo, an impious troop in-hies!

ííííO'er the landStreams the band;Hot desire,Drunken-fireIn their gazeWildly plays,--Makes their hairBristle there.And the troop,With fell swoop,Women, men,Coming then,Ply their blowsAnd expose,Void of shame,All the frame.Iron shot,Fierce and hot,Strike with fearOn the ear;All they slayOn their way.O'er the landPours the band;All take flightAt their sight.

ííííAh, o'er ev'ry plant they rush!Ah, their cruel footsteps crushAll the flowers that fill their path!Who will dare to stem their wrath?

ííííBrethren, let us venture all!

ííííVirtue in your pure cheek glows.Phoebus will attend our call

ííííWhen he sees our heavy woes;And that we may have arightWeapons suited to the fight,He the mountain shaketh now--From its browRattling downStone on stoneThrough the thicket spread appear.Brethren, seize them! Wherefore fear?Now the villain crew assail,As though with a storm of hail,And expel the strangers wildFrom these regions soft and mildWhere the sun has ever smil'd!

ííííWhat strange wonder do I see?Can it be?All my limbs of power are reft.And all strength my hand has left.Can it he?None are strangers that I see!And our brethren 'tis who goOn before, the way to show!Oh, the reckless impious ones!How they, with their jarring tones,Beat the time, as on they hie!Quick, my brethren!--let us fly!

ííííTo the rash ones, yet a word!Ay, my voice shall now be heard,As a peal of thunder, strong!

ííííWords as poets' arms were made,--

ííííWhen the god will he obey'd,Follow fast his darts ere long.

ííííWas it possible that yeThus your godlike dignityShould forget? The Thyrsus rude

ííííMust a heavy burden feel

ííííTo the hand but wont to stealO'er the lyre in gentle mood.From the sparkling waterfalls,From the brook that purling calls,Shall Silenus' loathsome beastBe allow'd at will to feast?Aganippe's * wave he sipsWith profane and spreading lips,--With ungainly feet stamps madly,Till the waters flow on sadly.

ííííFain I'd think myself deluded

ííííIn the sadd'ning sounds I hear;From the holy glades secluded

ííííHateful tones assail the ear.Laughter wild (exchange how mournful!)

ííííTakes the place of love's sweet dream;Women-haters and the scornful

ííííIn exulting chorus scream.Nightingale and turtle dove

ííííFly their nests so warm and chaste,And, inflamed with sensual love,

ííííHolds the Faun the Nymph embrac'd.Here a garment's torn away,

ííííScoffs succeed their sated bliss,While the god, with angry ray,

ííííLooks upon each impious kiss.

ííííVapour, smoke, as from a fire,

ííííAnd advancing clouds I view;Chords not only grace the lyre,

ííííFor the bow its chords bath too.Even the adorer's heart

ííííDreads the wild advancing hand,For the flames that round them dart

ííííShow the fierce destroyer's hand.

ííííOh neglect not what I say,

ííííFor I speak it lovingly!From our boundaries haste away,

ííííFrom the god's dread anger fly!Cleanse once more the holy place,

ííííTurn the savage train aside!Earth contains upon its face

ííííMany a spot unsanctified;Here we only prize the good.

ííííStars unsullied round us burn.

ííííIf ye, in repentant mood,

ííííFrom your wanderings would return,--If ye fail to find the bliss

ííííThat ye found with us of yore,--Or when lawless mirth like this

ííííGives your hearts delight no more,--Then return in pilgrim guise,

ííííGladly up the mountain go,While your strains repentant rise,

ííííAnd our brethren's advent show.

ííííLet a new-born wreath entwine

ííííSolemnly your temples round;Rapture glows in hearts divine

ííííWhen a long-lost sinner's found.Swifter e'en than Lathe's flood

ííííRound Death's silent house can play,Ev'ry error of the good

ííííWill love's chalice wash away.All will haste your steps to meet,

ííííAs ye come in majesty,--Men your blessing will entreat;--

ííííOurs ye thus will doubly be!

íííí1798.(* Aganippe--A spring in Boeotia, which arose out of MountHelicon, and was sacred to Apollo and the Muses.)-----LILY'S MENAGERIE.

íííí[Goethe describes this much-admired Poem, which he wrote inhonour of his love Lily, as being ""designed to change hissurrender of her into despair, by drolly-fretful images.""]

ííííTHERE'S no menagerie, I vow,

ííííExcels my Lily's at this minute;

ííííShe keeps the strangest creatures in it,And catches them, she knows not how.

ííííOh, how they hop, and run, and rave,And their clipp'd pinions wildly wave,--Poor princes, who must all endureThe pangs of love that nought can cure.

ííííWhat is the fairy's name?--Is't Lily?--Ask not me!Give thanks to Heaven if she's unknown to thee.

ííííOh what a cackling, what a shrieking,

ííííWhen near the door she takes her stand,

ííííWith her food-basket in her hand!Oh what a croaking, what a squeaking!Alive all the trees and the bushes appear,While to her feet whole troops draw near;The very fish within, the water clearSplash with impatience and their heads protrude;And then she throws around the foodWith such a look!--the very gods delighting(To say nought of beasts). There begins, then, a biting,A picking, a pecking, a sipping,And each o'er the legs of another is tripping,And pushing, and pressing, and flapping,And chasing, and fuming, and snapping,And all for one small piece of bread,To which, though dry, her fair hands give a taste,As though it in ambrosia had been plac'd.

ííííAnd then her look! the tone

ííííWith which she calls: Pipi! Pipi!Would draw Jove's eagle from his throne;Yes, Venus' turtle doves, I wean,And the vain peacock e'en,Would come, I swear,Soon as that tone had reach'd them through the air.

ííííE'en from a forest dark had she

ííííEnticed a bear, unlick'd, ill-bred,

ííííAnd, by her wiles alluring, ledTo join the gentle company,Until as tame as they was he:(Up to a certain point, be't understood!)How fair, and, ah, how goodShe seem'd to be! I would have drain'd my bloodTo water e'en her flow'rets sweet.

íííí""Thou sayest: I! Who? How? And where?""--Well, to be plain, good Sirs--I am the bear;

ííííIn a net-apron, caught, alas!

ííííChain'd by a silk-thread at her feet.

ííííBut how this wonder came to passI'll tell some day, if ye are curious;Just now, my temper's much too furious.

ííííAh, when I'm in the corner plac'd,

ííííAnd hear afar the creatures snapping,

ííííAnd see the flipping and the flapping,

ííííI turn around

ííííWith growling sound,

ííííAnd backward run a step in haste,

ííííAnd look around

ííííWith growling sound.

ííííThen run again a step in haste,And to my former post go round.

ííííBut suddenly my anger grows,A mighty spirit fills my nose,My inward feelings all revolt.A creature such as thou! a dolt!Pipi, a squirrel able nuts to crack!I bristle up my shaggy backUnused a slave to be.I'm laughed at by each trim and upstart treeTo scorn. The bowling-green I fly,

ííííWith neatly-mown and well-kept grass:

ííííThe box makes faces as I pass,--Into the darkest thicket hasten I,Hoping to 'scape from the ring,Over the palings to spring!Vainly I leap and climb;

ííííI feel a leaden spell.

ííííThat pinions me as well,And when I'm fully wearied out in time,I lay me down beside some mock-cascade,

ííííAnd roll myself half dead, and foam, and cry,

ííííAnd, ah! no Oreads hear my sigh,Excepting those of china made!

ííííBut, ah, with sudden power

ííííIn all my members blissful feelings reign!'Tis she who singeth yonder in her bower!

ííííI hear that darling, darling voice again.The air is warm, and teems with fragrance clear,Sings she perchance for me alone to hear?

ííííI haste, and trample down the shrubs amain;The trees make way, the bushes all retreat,And so--the beast is lying at her feet.

ííííShe looks at him: ""The monster's droll enough!

ííííHe's, for a bear, too mild,

ííííYet, for a dog, too wild,So shaggy, clumsy, rough!""Upon his back she gently strokes her foot;

ííííHe thinks himself in Paradise.What feelings through his seven senses shoot!

ííííBut she looks on with careless eyes.I lick her soles, and kiss her shoes,

ííííAs gently as a bear well may;Softly I rise, and with a clever ruse

ííííLeap on her knee.--On a propitious dayShe suffers it; my ears then tickles she,

ííííAnd hits me a hard blow in wanton play;I growl with new-born ecstasy;Then speaks she in a sweet vain jest, I wot""Allons lout doux! eh! la menotte!Et faites serviteurComme un joli seigneur.""Thus she proceeds with sport and glee;

ííííHope fills the oft-deluded beast;Yet if one moment he would lazy be,

ííííHer fondness all at once hath ceas'd.

ííííShe doth a flask of balsam-fire possess,

ííííSweeter than honey bees can make,

ííííOne drop of which she'll on her finger take,When soften'd by his love and faithfulness,

ííííWherewith her monster's raging thirst to slake;Then leaves me to myself, and flies at last,And I, unbound, yet prison'd fastBy magic, follow in her train,Seek for her, tremble, fly again.The hapless creature thus tormenteth she,

ííííRegardless of his pleasure or his woe;Ha! oft half-open'd does she leave the door for me,

ííííAnd sideways looks to learn if I will fly or no.And I--Oh gods! your hands aloneCan end the spell that's o'er me thrown;Free me, and gratitude my heart will fill;

ííííAnd yet from heaven ye send me down no aid--

ííííNot quite in vain doth life my limbs pervade:I feel it! Strength is left me still.

íííí1775.-----TO CHARLOTTE.

íííí'MIDST the noise of merriment and glee,

íííí'Midst full many a sorrow, many a care,Charlotte, I remember, we remember thee,

ííííHow, at evening's hour so fair,Thou a kindly hand didst reach us,

ííííWhen thou, in some happy place

ííííWhere more fair is Nature s face,

ííííMany a lightly-hidden traceOf a spirit loved didst teach us.

ííííWell 'tis that thy worth I rightly knew,--

ííííThat I, in the hour when first we met,

ííííWhile the first impression fill'd me yet,Call'd thee then a girl both good and true.

ííííRear'd in silence, calmly, knowing nought,

ííííOn the world we suddenly are thrown;Hundred thousand billows round us sport;

ííííAll things charm us--many please alone,Many grieve us, and as hour on hour is stealing,

ííííTo and fro our restless natures sway;First we feel, and then we find each feeling

ííííBy the changeful world-stream borne away.

ííííWell I know, we oft within us find

ííííMany a hope and many a smart.Charlotte, who can know our mind?

ííííCharlotte, who can know our heart?Ah! 'twould fain be understood, 'twould fain o'erflow

ííííIn some creature's fellow-feelings blest,And, with trust, in twofold measure know

ííííAll the grief and joy in Nature's breast.

ííííThen thine eye is oft around thee cast,

ííííBut in vain, for all seems closed for ever.Thus the fairest part of life is madly pass'd

ííííFree from storm, but resting never:To thy sorrow thou'rt to-day repell'd

ííííBy what yesterday obey'd thee.Can that world by thee be worthy held

ííííWhich so oft betray'd thee?

ííííWhich, 'mid all thy pleasures and thy pains,

ííííLived in selfish, unconcern'd repose?See, the soul its secret cells regains,

ííííAnd the heart--makes haste to close.Thus found I thee, and gladly went to meet thee;

íííí""She's worthy of all love!"" I cried,And pray'd that Heaven with purest bliss might greet thee,

ííííWhich in thy friend it richly hath supplied.

íííí1776.*-----LOVE'S DISTRESSES.

ííííWHO will hear me? Whom shall I lament to?Who would pity me that heard my sorrows?Ah, the lip that erst so many rapturesUsed to taste, and used to give responsive,Now is cloven, and it pains me sorely;And it is not thus severely woundedBy my mistress having caught me fiercely,And then gently bitten me, intendingTo secure her friend more firmly to her:No, my tender lip is crack'd thus, onlyBy the winds, o'er rime and frost proceeding,Pointed, sharp, unloving, having met me.Now the noble grape's bright juice commingledWith the bee's sweet juice, upon the fireOf my hearth, shall ease me of my torment.Ah, what use will all this be, if with itLove adds not a drop of his own balsam?

íííí1789.*-----THE MUSAGETES.

ííííIN the deepest nights of WinterTo the Muses kind oft cried I:""Not a ray of morn is gleaming,Not a sign of daylight breaking;Bring, then, at the fitting moment,Bring the lamp's soft glimm'ring lustre,'Stead of Phoebus and Aurora,To enliven my still labours!""Yet they left me in my slumbers,Dull and unrefreshing, lying,And to each late-waken'd morningFollow'd days devoid of profit.

ííííWhen at length return'd the spring-time,To the nightingales thus spake I:""Darling nightingales, oh, beat yeEarly, early at my window,--Wake me from the heavy slumberThat chains down the youth so strongly!""Yet the love-o'erflowing songstersTheir sweet melodies protractedThrough the night before my window,Kept awake my loving spirit,Rousing new and tender yearningsIn my newly-waken'd bosom.And the night thus fleeted o'er me,And Aurora found me sleeping,--Ay, the sun could scarce arouse me.

ííííNow at length is come the Summer,And the early fly so busyDraws me from my pleasing slumbersAt the first-born morning-glimmer.Mercilessly then returns she,Though the half-aroused one oftenScares her from him with impatience,And she lures her shameless sisters,So that from my weary eyelidsKindly sleep ere long is driven.From my couch then boldly spring I,And I seek the darling Muses,in the beechen-grove I find them,Full of pieasure to receive me;And to the tormenting insectsOwe I many a golden hour.Thus be ye, unwelcome beings,Highly valued by the poet,As the flies my numbers tell of.

íííí1798.-----MORNING LAMENT.

ííííOH thou cruel deadly-lovely maiden,Tell me what great sin have I committed,That thou keep'st me to the rack thus fasten'd,That thou hast thy solemn promise broken?

íííí'Twas but yestere'en that thou with fondnessPress'd my hand, and these sweet accents murmured:""Yes, I'll come, I'll come when morn approacheth,Come, my friend, full surely to thy chamber.""

ííííOn the latch I left my doors, unfasten'd,Having first with care tried all the hinges,And rejoic'd right well to find they creak'd not.

ííííWhat a night of expectation pass'd I!For I watch'd, and ev'ry chime I number'd;If perchance I slept a few short moments,Still my heart remain'd awake forever,And awoke me from my gentle slumbers.

ííííYes, then bless'd I night's o'erhanging darkness,That so calmly cover'd all things round me;I enjoy'd the universal silence,While I listen'd ever in the silence,If perchance the slightest sounds were stirring.

íííí""Had she only thoughts, my thoughts resembling,Had she only feelings, like my feelings,She would not await the dawn of morning.But, ere this, would surely have been with me.""

ííííSkipp'd a kitten on the floor above me,Scratch'd a mouse a panel in the corner,Was there in the house the slightest motion,Ever hoped I that I heard thy footstep,Ever thought I that I heard thee coming.And so lay I long, and ever longer,And already was the daylight dawning,And both here and there were signs of movement.

íííí""Is it yon door? Were it my door only!""In my bed I lean'd upon my elbow,Looking tow'rd the door, now half-apparent,If perchance it might not be in motion.Both the wings upon the latch continued,On the quiet hinges calmly hanging.

ííííAnd the day grew bright and brighter ever;And I heard my neighbour's door unbolted,As he went to earn his daily wages,And ere long I heard the waggons rumbling,And the city gates were also open'd,While the market-place, in ev'ry corner,Teem'd with life and bustle and confusion.

ííííIn the house was going now and comingUp and down the stairs, and doors were creakingBackwards now, now forwards,--footsteps clatter'dYet, as though it were a thing all-living,From my cherish'd hope I could not tear me.

ííííWhen at length the sun, in hated splendour.Fell upon my walls, upon my windows,Up I sprang, and hasten'd to the garden,There to blend my breath, so hot and yearning,With the cool refreshing morning breezes,And, it might be, even there to meet thee:But I cannot find thee in the arbour,Or the avenue of lofty lindens.

íííí1789.*-----THE VISIT.

ííííFAIN had I to-day surprised my mistress,But soon found I that her door was fasten'd.Yet I had the key safe in my pocket,And the darling door I open'd softly!In the parlour found I not the maiden,Found the maiden not within her closet,Then her chamber-door I gently open'd,When I found her wrapp'd in pleasing slumbers,Fully dress'd, and lying on the sofa.

ííííWhile at work had slumber stolen o'er her;For her knitting and her needle found IResting in her folded bands so tender;And I placed myself beside her softly,And held counsel, whether I should wake her.

ííííThen I looked upon the beauteous quietThat on her sweet eyelids was reposingOn her lips was silent truth depicted,On her cheeks had loveliness its dwelling,And the pureness of a heart unsulliedIn her bosom evermore was heaving.All her limbs were gracefully reclining,Set at rest by sweet and godlike balsam.Gladly sat I, and the contemplationHeld the strong desire I felt to wake herFirmer and firmer down, with mystic fetters.

íííí""Oh, thou love,"" methought, ""I see that slumber,Slumber that betrayeth each false feature,Cannot injure thee, can nought discoverThat could serve to harm thy friend's soft feelings.

íííí""Now thy beauteous eyes are firmly closed,That, when open, form mine only rapture.And thy sweet lips are devoid of motion,Motionless for speaking or for kissing;Loosen'd are the soft and magic fettersOf thine arms, so wont to twine around me,And the hand, the ravishing companionOf thy sweet caresses, lies unmoving.Were my thoughts of thee but based on error,Were the love I bear thee self-deception,I must now have found it out, since AmorIs, without his bandage, placed beside me.""

ííííLong I sat thus, full of heartfelt pleasureAt my love, and at her matchless merit;She had so delighted me while slumbering,That I could not venture to awake her.

ííííThen I on the little table near herSoftly placed two oranges, two roses;Gently, gently stole I from her chamber.When her eyes the darling one shall open,She will straightway spy these colourd presents,And the friendly gift will view with wonder,For the door will still remain unopen'd.

ííííIf perchance I see to-night the angel,How will she rejoice,--reward me doublyFor this sacrifice of fond affection!

íííí1765.-----THE MAGIC NET.

ííííDo I see a contest yonder?See I miracles or pastimes?Beauteous urchins, five in number,'Gainst five sisters fair contending,--Measured is the time they're beating--At a bright enchantress' bidding.Glitt'ring spears by some are wielded,Threads are others nimbly twining,

ííííSo that in their snares, the weaponsOne would think, must needs be captured,Soon, in truth, the spears are prison'd;Yet they, in the gentle war-dance,One by one escape their fettersIn the row of loops so tender,That make haste to seize a free oneSoon as they release a captive.

ííííSo with contests, strivings, triumphs,Flying now, and now returning,Is an artful net soon woven,In its whiteness like the snow-flakes,That, from light amid the darkness,Draw their streaky lines so varied,As e'en colours scarce can draw them.

ííííWho shall now receive that garmentFar beyond all others wish'd-for?Whom our much-loved mistress favourAs her own acknowledged servant?I am blest by kindly Fortune'sTokens true, in silence pray'd for!And I feel myself held captive,To her service now devoted.

ííííYet, e'en while I, thus enraptured,Thus adorn'd, am proudly wand'ring,See! yon wantons are entwining,Void of strife, with secret ardour,Other nets, each fine and finer,Threads of twilight interweaving,Moonbeams sweet, night-violets' balsam.

ííííEre the net is noticed by us,Is a happier one imprison'd,Whom we, one and all, togetherGreet with envy and with blessings.

íííí1803.-----THE GOBLET.

ííííONCE I held a well-carved brimming goblet,--In my two hands tightly clasp'd I held it,Eagerly the sweet wine sipp'd I from it,Seeking there to drown all care and sorrow.

ííííAmor enter'd in, and found me sitting,And he gently smiled in modest fashion,Smiled as though the foolish one he pitied.

íííí""Friend, I know a far more beauteous vessel,One wherein to sink thy spirit wholly;Say, what wilt thou give me, if I grant it,And with other nectar fill it for thee?""

ííííOh, how kindly hath he kept his promise!For to me, who long had yearn'd, he grantedThee, my Lida, fill'd with soft affection.

ííííWhen I clasp mine arms around thee fondly,When I drink in love's long-hoarded balsamFrom thy darling lips so true, so faithful,Fill'd with bliss thus speak I to my spirit""No! a vessel such as this, save AmorNever god hath fashion'd or been lord of!Such a form was ne'er produced by VulcanWith his cunning, reason-gifted hammers!On the leaf-crown'd mountains may LyaeusBid his Fauns, the oldest and the wisest,Pass the choicest clusters through the winepress,And himself watch o'er the fermentation:Such a draught no toil can e'er procure him!""

íííí1781.-----TO THE GRASSHOPPER.

ííííAFTER ANACREON.

íííí[The strong resemblance of this fine poem to Cowley's Ode bearingthe same name, and beginning ""Happy insect! what can be,"" will beat once seen.]

ííííHAPPY art thou, darling insect,Who, upon the trees' tall branches,By a modest draught inspired,Singing, like a monarch livest!Thou possessest as thy portionAll that on the plains thou seest,All that by the hours is brought thee'Mongst the husbandmen thou livest,As a friend, uninjured by them,Thou whom mortals love to honour,Herald sweet of sweet Spring's advent!Yes, thou'rt loved by all the Muses,

ííííPhoebus' self, too, needs must love thee;They their silver voices gave thee,Age can never steal upon thee.Wise and gentle friend of poets,Born a creature fleshless, bloodless,Though Earth's daughter, free from suff'ring,To the gods e'en almost equal.

íííí1781.-----FROM 'THE SORROWS OF YOUNG WERTHER.'

íííí[Prefixed to the second edition.]

ííííEV'RY youth for love's sweet portion sighs,

ííííEv'ry maiden sighs to win man's love;Why, alas! should bitter pain arise

ííííFrom the noblest passion that we prove?

ííííThou, kind soul, bewailest, lov'st him well,

ííííFrom disgrace his memory's saved by thee;Lo, his spirit signs from out its cell:

ííííBE A MAN, NOR SEEK TO FOLLOW ME.

íííí1775.-----TRILOGY OF PASSION.

ííííI. TO WERTHER.

íííí[This poem, written at the age of seventy-five, was appended toan edition of 'Werther,' published at that time.]

ííííONCE more, then, much-wept shadow, thou dost dare

ííííBoldly to face the day's clear light,To meet me on fresh blooming meadows fair,

ííííAnd dost not tremble at my sight.Those happy times appear return'd once more.

ííííWhen on one field we quaff'd refreshing dew,And, when the day's unwelcome toils were o'er,

ííííThe farewell sunbeams bless'd our ravish'd view;Fate bade thee go,--to linger here was mine,--Going the first, the smaller loss was thine.

ííííThe life of man appears a glorious fate:The day how lovely, and the night how great!And we 'mid Paradise-like raptures plac'd,The sun's bright glory scarce have learn'd to taste.

ííííWhen strange contending feelings dimly cover,Now us, and now the forms that round us hover;One's feelings by no other are supplied,'Tis dark without, if all is bright inside;An outward brightness veils my sadden'd mood,When Fortune smiles,--how seldom understood!Now think we that we know her, and with mightA woman's beauteous form instils delight;The youth, as glad as in his infancy,The spring-time treads, as though the spring were heRavish'd, amazed, he asks, how this is done?He looks around, the world appears his own.With careless speed he wanders on through space,Nor walls, nor palaces can check his race;As some gay flight of birds round tree-tops plays,So 'tis with him who round his mistress strays;He seeks from AEther, which he'd leave behind him,The faithful look that fondly serves to bind him.

ííííYet first too early warn'd, and then too late,He feels his flight restrain'd, is captur'd straightTo meet again is sweet, to part is sad,Again to meet again is still more glad,And years in one short moment are enshrin'd;But, oh, the harsh farewell is hid behind!

ííííThou smilest, friend, with fitting thoughts inspired;By a dread parting was thy fame acquired,Thy mournful destiny we sorrow'd o'er,For weal and woe thou left'st us evermore,And then again the passions' wavering forceDrew us along in labyrinthine course;And we, consumed by constant misery,At length must part--and parting is to die!How moving is it, when the minstrel sings,To 'scape the death that separation brings!Oh grant, some god, to one who suffers so,To tell, half-guilty, his sad tale of woe

íííí1824

ííííII. ELEGY.

ííííWhen man had ceased to utter his lament,

ííííA god then let me tell my tale of sorrow.

ííííWHAT hope of once more meeting is there nowIn the still-closed blossoms of this day?Both heaven and hell thrown open seest thou;What wav'ring thoughts within the bosom playNo longer doubt! Descending from the sky,She lifts thee in her arms to realms on high.

ííííAnd thus thou into Paradise wert brought,

ííííAs worthy of a pure and endless life;Nothing was left, no wish, no hope, no thought,

ííííHere was the boundary of thine inmost strife:And seeing one so fair, so glorified,The fount of yearning tears was straightway dried.

ííííNo motion stirr'd the day's revolving wheel,

ííííIn their own front the minutes seem'd to go;The evening kiss, a true and binding seal,

ííííNe'er changing till the morrow's sunlight glow.The hours resembled sisters as they went.Yet each one from another different.

ííííThe last hour's kiss, so sadly sweet, effac'd

ííííA beauteous network of entwining love.Now on the threshold pause the feet, now haste.

ííííAs though a flaming cherub bade them move;The unwilling eye the dark road wanders o'er,Backward it looks, but closed it sees the door.

ííííAnd now within itself is closed this breast,

ííííAs though it ne'er were open, and as though,Vying with ev'ry star, no moments blest

ííííHad, in its presence, felt a kindling glow;Sadness, reproach, repentance, weight of care,Hang heavy on it in the sultry air.

ííííIs not the world still left? The rocky steeps,

ííííAre they with holy shades no longer crown'd?Grows not the harvest ripe? No longer creeps

ííííThe espalier by the stream,--the copse around?Doth not the wondrous arch of heaven still rise,Now rich in shape, now shapeless to the eyes?

ííííAs, seraph-like, from out the dark clouds' chorus,

ííííWith softness woven, graceful, light, and fair,Resembling Her, in the blue aether o'er us,

ííííA slender figure hovers in the air,--Thus didst thou see her joyously advance,The fairest of the fairest in the dance.

ííííYet but a moment dost thou boldly dare

ííííTo clasp an airy form instead of hers;Back to thine heart! thou'lt find it better there,

ííííFor there in changeful guise her image stirsWhat erst was one, to many turneth fast,In thousand forms, each dearer than the last.

ííííAs at the door, on meeting lingerd she,

ííííAnd step by step my faithful ardour bless'd,For the last kiss herself entreated me,

ííííAnd on my lips the last last kiss impress'd,--Thus clearly traced, the lov'd one's form we view,With flames engraven on a heart so true,--

ííííA heart that, firm as some embattled tower,

ííííItself for her, her in itself reveres,For her rejoices in its lasting power,

ííííConscious alone, when she herself appears;Feels itself freer in so sweet a thrall,And only beats to give her thanks in all.

ííííThe power of loving, and all yearning sighs

ííííFor love responsive were effaced and drown'd;While longing hope for joyous enterprise

ííííWas form'd, and rapid action straightway found;If love can e'er a loving one inspire,Most lovingly it gave me now its fire;

ííííAnd 'twas through her!--an inward sorrow lay

ííííOn soul and body, heavily oppress'd;To mournful phantoms was my sight a prey,

ííííIn the drear void of a sad tortured breast;Now on the well-known threshold Hope hath smil'd,Herself appeareth in the sunlight mild.

ííííUnto the peace of God, which, as we read,

ííííBlesseth us more than reason e'er bath done,Love's happy peace would I compare indeed,

ííííWhen in the presence of the dearest one.There rests the heart, and there that sweetest thought,The thought of being hers, is check'd by nought.

ííííIn the pure bosom doth a yearning float,

ííííUnto a holier, purer, unknown BeingIts grateful aspiration to devote,

ííííThe Ever-Nameless then unriddled seeing;We call it: piety!--such blest delightI feel a share in, when before her sight.

ííííBefore her sight, as 'neath the sun's hot ray,

ííííBefore her breath, as 'neath the spring's soft wind,In its deep wintry cavern melts away

ííííSelf-love, so long in icy chains confin'd;No selfishness and no self-will are nigh,For at her advent they were forced to fly.

ííííIt seems as though she said: ""As hours pass by

ííííThey spread before us life with kindly plan;Small knowledge did the yesterday supply,

ííííTo know the morrow is conceal'd from man;And if the thought of evening made me start,The sun at setting gladden'd straight my heart.

íííí""Act, then, as I, and look, with joyous mind,

ííííThe moment in the face; nor linger thou!Meet it with speed, so fraught with life, so kind

ííííIn action, and in love so radiant now;Let all things be where thou art, childlike ever,Thus thoult be all, thus, thou'lt be vanquish'd never.""

ííííThou speakest well, methought, for as thy guide

ííííThe moment's favour did a god assign,And each one feels himself when by thy side,

ííííFate's fav'rite in a moment so divine;I tremble at thy look that bids me go,Why should I care such wisdom vast to know?

ííííNow am I far! And what would best befit

ííííThe present minute? I could scarcely tell;Full many a rich possession offers it,

ííííThese but offend, and I would fain repel.Yearnings unquenchable still drive me on,All counsel, save unbounded tears, is gone.

ííííFlow on, flow on in never-ceasing course,

ííííYet may ye never quench my inward fire!Within my bosom heaves a mighty force,

ííííWhere death and life contend in combat dire.Medicines may serve the body's pangs to still;Nought but the spirit fails in strength of will,--

ííííFails in conception; wherefore fails it so?

ííííA thousand times her image it portrays;Enchanting now, and now compell'd to go,

ííííNow indistinct, now clothed in purest rays!How could the smallest comfort here be flowing?The ebb and flood, the coming and the going!

íííí*      *      *      *      *      *

ííííLeave me here now, my life's companions true!

ííííLeave me alone on rock, in moor and heath;But courage! open lies the world to you,

ííííThe glorious heavens above, the earth beneath;Observe, investigate, with searching eyes,And nature will disclose her mysteries.

ííííTo me is all, I to myself am lost,

ííííWho the immortals' fav'rite erst was thought;They, tempting, sent Pandoras to my cost,

ííííSo rich in wealth, with danger far more fraught;They urged me to those lips, with rapture crown'd,Deserted me, and hurl'd me to the ground.

íííí1823.

ííííIII.  ATONEMENT.

íííí[Composed, when 74 years old, for a Polish lady, who excelled inplaying on the pianoforte.]

ííííPASSION brings reason--who can pacify

ííííAn anguish'd heart whose loss hath been so great?Where are the hours that fled so swiftly by?

ííííIn vain the fairest thou didst gain from fate;Sad is the soul, confused the enterprise;

ííííThe glorious world, how on the sense it dies!

ííííIn million tones entwined for evermore,

ííííMusic with angel-pinions hovers there,To pierce man's being to its inmost core,

ííííEternal beauty has its fruit to bear;The eye grows moist, in yearnings blest reveresThe godlike worth of music as of tears.

ííííAnd so the lighten'd heart soon learns to see

ííííThat it still lives, and beats, and ought to beat,Off'ring itself with joy and willingly,

ííííIn grateful payment for a gift so sweet.And then was felt,--oh may it constant prove!--The twofold bliss of music and of love.

íííí1823.-----

ííííTHE remembrance of the GoodKeep us ever glad in mood.

ííííThe remembrance of the FairMakes a mortal rapture share.

ííííThe remembrance of one's LoveBlest Is, if it constant prove.

ííííThe remembrance of the OneIs the greatest joy that's known.

íííí1828.-----[Written at the age of 77.]

ííííWHEN I was still a youthful wight,

ííííSo full of enjoyment and merry,The painters used to assert, in spite,

ííííThat my features were small--yes, very;Yet then full many a beauteous childWith true affection upon me smil'd.

ííííNow as a greybeard I sit here in state,

ííííBy street and by lane held in awe, sirs;And may be seen, like old Frederick the Great,

ííííOn pipebowls, on cups, and on saucers.Yet the beauteous maidens, they keep afar;Oh vision of youth! Oh golden star!

íííí1826.-----FOR EVER.

ííííTHE happiness that man, whilst prison'd here,

ííííIs wont with heavenly rapture to compare,--The harmony of Truth, from wavering clear,--

ííííOf Friendship that is free from doubting care,--The light which in stray thoughts alone can cheer

ííííThe wise,--the bard alone in visions fair,--In my best hours I found in her all this,And made mine own, to mine exceeding bliss.

íííí1820.*-----FROM AN ALBUM OF 1604.

ííííHOPE provides wings to thought, and love to hope.Rise up to Cynthia, love, when night is clearest,And say, that as on high her figure changeth,So, upon earth, my joy decays and grows.And whisper in her ear with modest softness,How doubt oft hung its head, and truth oft wept.And oh ye thoughts, distrustfully inclined,If ye are therefore by the loved one chided,Answer: 'tis true ye change, but alter not,As she remains the same, yet changeth ever.Doubt may invade the heart, but poisons not,For love is sweeter, by suspicion flavour'd.If it with anger overcasts the eye,And heaven's bright purity perversely blackens,Then zephyr-sighs straight scare the clouds away,And, changed to tears, dissolve them into rain.Thought, hope, and love remain there as before,Till Cynthia gleams upon me as of old.

íííí1820.*-----LINES ON SEEING SCHILLER'S SKULL.

íííí[This curious imitation of the ternary metre of Dante was writtenat the age of 77.]

ííííWITHIN a gloomy charnel-house one day

ííííI view'd the countless skulls, so strangely mated,And of old times I thought, that now were grey.

ííííClose pack'd they stand, that once so fiercely hated,And hardy bones, that to the death contended,

ííííAre lying cross'd,--to lie for ever, fated.What held those crooked shoulder-blades suspended?

ííííNo one now asks; and limbs with vigour fired,The hand, the foot--their use in life is ended.

ííííVainly ye sought the tomb for rest when tired;Peace in the grave may not be yours; ye're driven

ííííBack into daylight by a force inspired;But none can love the wither'd husk, though even

ííííA glorious noble kernel it contained.To me, an adept, was the writing given

ííííWhich not to all its holy sense explained,When 'mid the crowd, their icy shadows flinging,

ííííI saw a form, that glorious still remained.And even there, where mould and damp were clinging,

ííííGave me a blest, a rapture-fraught emotion,As though from death a living fount were springing.

ííííWhat mystic joy I felt! What rapt devotion!That form, how pregnant with a godlike trace!

ííííA look, how did it whirl me tow'rd that oceanWhose rolling billows mightier shapes embrace!

ííííMysterious vessel! Oracle how dear!Even to grasp thee is my hand too base,

ííííExcept to steal thee from thy prison hereWith pious purpose, and devoutly go

ííííBack to the air, free thoughts, and sunlight clear.What greater gain in life can man e'er know

ííííThan when God-Nature will to him explainHow into Spirit steadfastness may flow,

ííííHow steadfast, too, the Spirit-Born remain.

íííí1826.-----ROYAL PRAYER.

ííííHA, I am the lord of earth! The noble,

ííííWho're in my service, love me.Ha, I am the lord of earth! The noble,

ííííO'er whom my sway extendeth, love I.Oh, grant me, God in Heaven, that I may ne'er

ííííDispense with loftiness and love!

íííí1815.*-----HUMAN FEELINGS.

ííííAH, ye gods! ye great immortalsIn the spacious heavens above us!Would ye on this earth but give usSteadfast minds and dauntless courageWe, oh kindly ones, would leave youAll your spacious heavens above us!

íííí1815.*-----ON THE DIVAN.

ííííHE who knows himself and others

ííííHere will also see,That the East and West, like brothers,

ííííParted ne'er shall be.

íííí'Tween two worlds, be man's endeavour!So between the East and West

ííííTo revolve, be my behest!

íííí1833.*-----EXPLANATION  OF AN ANCIENT WOODCUT, REPRESENTINGHANS SACHS' POETICAL MISSION.

íííí[I feel considerable hesitation in venturing to offer thisversion of a poem which Carlyle describes to be 'a beautifulpiece (a very Hans Sacks beatified, both in character and style),which we wish there was any possibility of translating.' Thereader will be aware that Hans Sachs was the celebrated Minstrel-Cobbler of Nuremberg, who Wrote 208 plays, 1700 comic tales, andbetween 4000 and 5000 lyric poems. He flourished throughoutalmost the whole of the 16th century.]

ííííEARLY within his workshop here,On Sundays stands our master dear;His dirty apron he puts away,And wears a cleanly doublet to-day;Lets wax'd thread, hammer, and pincers rest,And lays his awl within his chest;The seventh day he takes reposeFrom many pulls and many blows.

ííííSoon as the spring-sun meets his view,Repose begets him labour anew;He feels that he holds within his brainA little world, that broods there amain,And that begins to act and to live,Which he to others would gladly give.

ííííHe had a skilful eye and true,And was full kind and loving too.For contemplation, clear and pure,--For making all his own again, sure;He had a tongue that charm'd when 'twas heard,And graceful and light flow'd ev'ry word;Which made the Muses in him rejoice,The Master-singer of their choice.

ííííAnd now a maiden enter'd there,With swelling breast, and body fair;With footing firm she took her place,And moved with stately, noble grace;She did not walk in wanton mood,Nor look around with glances lewd.

ííííShe held a measure in her hand,Her girdle was a golden band,A wreath of corn was on her head,Her eye the day's bright lustre shed;Her name is honest Industry,Else, Justice, Magnanimity.

ííííShe enter'd with a kindly greeting;He felt no wonder at the meeting,For, kind and fair as she might be,He long had known her, fancied he.

íííí""I have selected thee,"" she said,""From all who earth's wild mazes tread,That thou shouldst have clear-sighted sense,And nought that's wrong shouldst e'er commence.When others run in strange confusion,Thy gaze shall see through each illusionWhen others dolefully complain,Thy cause with jesting thou shalt gain,Honour and right shalt value duly,In everything act simply, truly,--Virtue and godliness proclaim,And call all evil by its name,Nought soften down, attempt no quibble,Nought polish up, nought vainly scribble.The world shall stand before thee, then,As seen by Albert Durer's ken,In manliness and changeless life,In inward strength, with firmness rife.Fair Nature's Genius by the handShall lead thee on through every land,Teach thee each different life to scan,Show thee the wondrous ways of man,His shifts, confusions, thrustings, and drubbings,Pushings, tearings, pressings, and rubbings;The varying madness of the crew,The anthill's ravings bring to view;But thou shalt see all this express'd,As though 'twere in a magic chest.Write these things down for folks on earth,In hopes they may to wit give birth.""--Then she a window open'd wide,And show'd a motley crowd outside,All kinds of beings 'neath the sky,As in his writings one may spy.

ííííOur master dear was, after this,On Nature thinking, full of bliss,When tow'rd him, from the other sideHe saw an aged woman glide;The name she bears, Historia,Mythologia, Fabula;With footstep tottering and unstableShe dragg'd a large and wooden carved-table,Where, with wide sleeves and human mien,The Lord was catechizing seen;Adam, Eve, Eden, the Serpent's seduction,Gomorrah and Sodom's awful destruction,The twelve illustrious women, too,That mirror of honour brought to view;All kinds of bloodthirstiness, murder, and sin,The twelve wicked tyrants also were in,And all kinds of goodly doctrine and law;Saint Peter with his scourge you saw,With the world's ways dissatisfied,And by our Lord with power supplied.Her train and dress, behind and before,And e'en the seams, were painted o'erWith tales of worldly virtue and crime.--Our master view'd all this for a time;The sight right gladly he survey'd,So useful for him in his trade,Whence he was able to procureExample good and precept sure,Recounting all with truthful care,As though he had been present there.His spirit seem'd from earth to fly,He ne'er had turned away his eye,Did he not just behind him hearA rattle of bells approaching near.And now a fool doth catch his eye,With goat and ape's leap drawing nighA merry interlude preparingWith fooleries and jests unsparing.Behind him, in a line drawn out,He dragg'd all fools, the lean and stout,The great and little, the empty and full,All too witty, and all too dull,A lash he flourish'd overhead,As though a dance of apes he led,Abusing them with bitterness,As though his wrath would ne'er grow less.

ííííWhile on this sight our master gazed,His head was growing well-nigh crazed:What words for all could he e'er find,Could such a medley be combined?Could he continue with delightFor evermore to sing and write?When lo, from out a cloud's dark bedIn at the upper window spedThe Muse, in all her majesty,As fair as our loved maids we see.With clearness she around him threwHer truth, that ever stronger grew.

íííí""I, to ordain thee come,"" she spake:""So prosper, and my blessing take!The holy fire that slumb'ring liesWithin thee, in bright flames shall rise;Yet that thine ever-restless lifeMay still with kindly strength be rife,I, for thine inward spirit's calm.Have granted nourishment and balm,That rapture may thy soul imbue,Like some fair blossom bathed in dew.""--Behind his house then secretlyOutside the doorway pointed she,Where, in a shady garden-nook,A beauteous maid with downcast lookWas sitting where a stream was flowing,With elder bushes near it growing,She sat beneath an apple tree,And nought around her seem'd to see.Her lap was full of roses fair,Which in a wreath she twined with care.And, with them, leaves and blossoms blended:For whom was that sweet wreath intended?Thus sat she, modest and retired,Her bosom throbb'd, with hope inspired;Such deep forebodings fill'd her mind,No room for wishing could she find,And with the thoughts that o'er it flew,Perchance a sigh was mingled too.

íííí""But why should sorrow cloud thy brow?That, dearest love, which fills thee nowIs fraught with joy and ecstasy.Prepared in one alone for thee,That he within thine eye may findSolace when fortune proves unkind,And be newborn through many a kiss,That he receives with inward bliss;When'er he clasps thee to his breast.May he from all his toils find restWhen he in thy dear arms shall sink,May he new life and vigour drink:Fresh joys of youth shalt thou obtain,In merry jest rejoice again.With raillery and roguish spite,Thou now shalt tease him, now delight.Thus Love will nevermore grow old,Thus will the minstrel ne'er be cold!""

ííííWhile he thus lives, in secret bless'd,Above him in the clouds doth restAn oak-wreath, verdant and sublime,Placed on his brow in after-time;While they are banish'd to the slough,Who their great master disavow.

íííí-----Lovingly I'll sing of love;Ever comes she from above.-----THE FRIENDLY MEETING.

ííííIN spreading mantle to my chin conceald,

ííííI trod the rocky path, so steep and grey,

ííííThen to the wintry plain I bent my wayUneasily, to flight my bosom steel'd.

ííííBut sudden was the newborn day reveal'd:

ííííA maiden came, in heavenly bright array,

ííííLike the fair creatures of the poet's layIn realms of song. My yearning heart was heal'd.

ííííYet turn'd I thence, till she had onward pass'd,

ííííWhile closer still the folds to draw I tried,

ííííAs though with heat self-kindled to grow warm;

ííííBut follow'd her. She stood. The die was cast!

ííííNo more within my mantle could I hide;

ííííI threw it off,--she lay within mine arm.

íííí1807-8.-----IN A WORD.

ííííTHUS to be chain'd for ever, can I bear?

ííííA very torment that, in truth, would be.

ííííThis very day my new resolve shall see.--I'll not go near the lately-worshipp'd Fair.

ííííYet what excuse, my heart, can I prepare

ííííIn such a case, for not consulting thee?

ííííBut courage! while our sorrows utter weIn tones where love, grief, gladness have a share.

ííííBut see! the minstrel's bidding to obey,

ííííIts melody pours forth the sounding lyre,

ííííYearning a sacrifice of love to bring.

ííííScarce wouldst thou think it--ready is the lay;

ííííWell, but what then? Methought in the first fire

ííííWe to her presence flew, that lay to sing.

íííí1807?.-----THE MAIDEN SPEAKS.

ííííHow grave thou loookest, loved one! wherefore so?

ííííThy marble image seems a type of thee;

ííííLike it, no sign of life thou giv'st to me;Compared with thee, the stone appears to glow.

ííííBehind his shield in ambush lurks the foe,

ííííThe friend's brow all-unruffled we should see.

ííííI seek thee, but thou seek'st away to flee;Fix'd as this sculptured figure, learn to grow!

ííííTell me, to which should I the preference pay?

ííííMust I from both with coldness meet alone?

ííííThe one is lifeless, thou with life art blest.

ííííIn short, no longer to throw words away,

ííííI'll fondy kiss and kiss and kiss this stone,

ííííTill thou dost tear me hence with envious breast.

íííí1807.-----GROWTH.

ííííO'ER field and plain, in childhood's artless days,

ííííThou sprang'st with me, on many a spring-morn fair.

íííí""For such a daughter, with what pleasing care,Would I, as father, happy dwellings raise!""

ííííAnd when thou on the world didst cast thy gaze,

ííííThy joy was then in household toils to share.

íííí""Why did I trust her, why she trust me e'er?For such a sister, how I Heaven should praise!""

ííííNothing can now the beauteous growth retard;

ííííLove's glowing flame within my breast is fann'd.

ííííShall I embrace her form, my grief to end?

ííííThee as a queen must I, alas, regard:

ííííSo high above me placed thou seem'st to stand;

ííííBefore a passing look I meekly bend.

íííí1807?.-----FOOD IN TRAVEL.

ííííIF to her eyes' bright lustre I were blind,

ííííNo longer would they serve my life to gild.

ííííThe will of destiny must be fulfilid,--This knowing, I withdrew with sadden'd mind.

ííííNo further happiness I now could find:

ííííThe former longings of my heart were still'd;

ííííI sought her looks alone, whereon to buildMy joy in life,--all else was left behind.

ííííWine's genial glow, the festal banquet gay,

ííííEase, sleep, and friends, all wonted pleasures glad

ííííI spurn'd, till little there remain'd to prove.

ííííNow calmly through the world I wend my way:

ííííThat which I crave may everywhere be had,

ííííWith me I bring the one thing needful--love.

íííí1807?.-----DEPARTURE.

ííííWITH many a thousand kiss not yet content,

ííííAt length with One kiss I was forced to go;

ííííAfter that bitter parting's depth of woe,I deem'd the shore from which my steps I bent,

ííííIts hills, streams, dwellings, mountains, as I went,

ííííA pledge of joy, till daylight ceased to glow;

ííííThen on my sight did blissful visions growIn the dim-lighted, distant firmament,

ííííAnd when at length the sea confined my gaze,

ííííMy ardent longing fill'd my heart once more;

ííííWhat I had lost, unwillingly I sought.

ííííThen Heaven appear'd to shed its kindly rays:

ííííMethought that all I had possess'd of yore

ííííRemain'd still mine--that I was reft of nought.

íííí1807?.-----THE LOVING ONE WRITES.

ííííTHE look that thy sweet eyes on mine impress

ííííThe pledge thy lips to mine convey,--the kiss,--

ííííHe who, like me, hath knowledge sure of this,Can he in aught beside find happiness?

ííííRemoved from thee, friend-sever'd, in distress,

ííííThese thoughts I vainly struggle to dismiss:

ííííThey still return to that one hour of bliss,The only one; then tears my grief confess.

ííííBut unawares the tear makes haste to dry:

ííííHe loves, methinks, e'en to these glades so still,--

ííííAnd shalt not thou to distant lands extend?

ííííReceive the murmurs of his loving sigh;

ííííMy only joy on earth is in thy will,

ííííThy kindly will tow'rd me; a token send!

íííí1807?.-----THE LOVING ONE ONCE MORE.

ííííWHY do I o'er my paper once more bend?

ííííAsk not too closely, dearest one, I pray

ííííFor, to speak truth, I've nothing now to say;Yet to thy hands at length 'twill come, dear friend.

ííííSince I can come not with it, what I send

ííííMy undivided heart shall now convey,

ííííWith all its joys, hopes, pleasures, pains, to-day:All this hath no beginning, hath no end.

ííííHenceforward I may ne'er to thee confide

ííííHow, far as thought, wish, fancy, will, can reach,

ííííMy faithful heart with thine is surely blended.

ííííThus stood I once enraptured by thy side,

ííííGazed on thee, and said nought. What need of speech?

ííííMy very being in itself was ended.

íííí1807?.-----SHE CANNOT END.

ííííWHEN unto thee I sent the page all white,

ííííInstead of first thereon inscribing aught,

ííííThe space thou doubtless filledst up in sport.And sent it me, to make my joy grow bright.

ííííAs soon as the blue cover met my sight,

ííííAs well becomes a woman, quick as thought

ííííI tore it open, leaving hidden nought,And read the well-known words of pure delight:

ííííMY ONLY BEING! DEAREST HEART! SWEET CHILD!

ííííHow kindly thou my yearning then didst still

ííííWith gentle words, enthralling me to thee.

ííííIn truth methought I read thy whispers mild

ííííWherewith thou lovingly my soul didst fill,

ííííE'en to myself for aye ennobling me.

íííí1807?.-----NEMESIS.

ííííWHEN through the nations stalks contagion wild,

ííííWe from them cautiously should steal away.

ííííE'en I have oft with ling'ring and delayShunn'd many an influence, not to be defil'd.

ííííAnd e'en though Amor oft my hours beguil'd,

ííííAt length with him preferr'd I not to play,

ííííAnd so, too, with the wretched sons of clay,When four and three-lined verses they compil'd.

ííííBut punishment pursues the scoffer straight,

ííííAs if by serpent-torch of furies led

ííííFrom bill to vale, from land to sea to fly.

ííííI hear the genie's laughter at my fate;

ííííYet do I find all power of thinking fled

ííííIn sonnet-rage and love's fierce ecstasy.

íííí1807-8.-----THE CHRISTMAS-BOX.

ííííTHIS box, mine own sweet darling, thou wilt find

ííííWith many a varied sweetmeat's form supplied;

ííííThe fruits are they of holy Christmas tide,But baked indeed, for children's use design'd.

ííííI'd fain, in speeches sweet with skill combin'd,

ííííPoetic sweetmeats for the feast provide;

ííííBut why in such frivolities confide?Perish the thought, with flattery to blind!

ííííOne sweet thing there is still, that from within,

ííííWithin us speaks,--that may be felt afar;

ííííThis may be wafted o'er to thee alone.

ííííIf thou a recollection fond canst win,

ííííAs if with pleasure gleam'd each well-known star,

ííííThe smallest gift thou never wilt disown.

íííí1807.-----THE WARNING.

ííííWHEN sounds the trumpet at the Judgment Day,

ííííAnd when forever all things earthly die,

ííííWe must a full and true account supplyOf ev'ry useless word we dropp'd in play.

ííííBut what effect will all the words convey

ííííWherein with eager zeal and lovingly,

ííííThat I might win thy favour, labour'd I,If on thine ear alone they die away?

ííííTherefore, sweet love, thy conscience bear in mind,

ííííRemember well how long thou hast delay'd,

ííííSo that the world such sufferings may not know.

ííííIf I must reckon, and excuses find

ííííFor all things useless I to thee have said,

ííííTo a full year the Judgment Day will grow

íííí1807?.-----THE EPOCHS.

ííííON Petrarch's heart, all other days before,

ííííIn flaming letters written, was impress d

ííííGOOD FRIDAY. And on mine, be it confess'd,Is this year's ADVENT, as it passeth o'er.

ííííI do not now begin,--I still adore

ííííHer whom I early cherish'd in my breast;,

ííííThen once again with prudence dispossess'd,And to whose heart I'm driven back once more.

ííííThe love of Petrarch, that all-glorious love,

ííííWas unrequited, and, alas, full sad;

ííííOne long Good Friday 'twas, one heartache drear

ííííBut may my mistress' Advent ever prove,

ííííWith its palm-jubilee, so sweet and glad,

ííííOne endless Mayday, through the livelong year!

íííí1807.-----THE DOUBTERS AND THE LOVERS.

ííííTHE DOUBTERS.

ííííYE love, and sonnets write! Fate's strange behest!

ííííThe heart, its hidden meaning to declare,

ííííMust seek for rhymes, uniting pair with pair:Learn, children, that the will is weak, at best.

ííííScarcely with freedom the o'erflowing breast

ííííAs yet can speak, and well may it beware;

ííííTempestuous passions sweep each chord that's there,Then once more sink to night and gentle rest.

ííííWhy vex yourselves and us, the heavy stone

ííííUp the steep path but step by step to roll?

ííííIt falls again, and ye ne'er cease to strive.

ííííTHE LOVERS.

ííííBut we are on the proper road alone!

ííííIf gladly is to thaw the frozen soul,

ííííThe fire of love must aye be kept alive.

íííí1807?.-----CHARADE.

ííííTwo words there 'are, both short, of beauty rare,

ííííWhose sounds our lips so often love to frame,

ííííBut which with clearness never can proclaimThe things whose own peculiar stamp they bear.

íííí'Tis well in days of age and youth so fair,

ííííOne on the other boldly to inflame;

ííííAnd if those words together link'd we name,A blissful rapture we discover there.

ííííBut now to give them pleasure do I seek,

ííííAnd in myself my happiness would find;

ííííI hope in silence, but I hope for this:

ííííGently, as loved one's names, those words to speak

ííííTo see them both within one image shrin'd,

ííííBoth in one being to embrace with bliss.

ííííTHUS roll I, never taking ease,My tub, like Saint Diogenes,Now serious am, now seek to please;Now love and hate in turn one sees;The motives now are those, now these;Now nothings, now realities.Thus roll I, never taking ease,My tub, like Saint Diogenes.

íííí1810.-----NEITHER THIS NOR THAT.

ííííIF thou to be a slave shouldst will,Thou'lt get no pity, but fare ill;And if a master thou wouldst be,The world will view it angrily;And if in statu quo thou stay,That thou art but a fool, they'll say.

ííííTHOUGH tempers are bad and peevish folks swear,Remember to ruffle thy brows, friend, ne'er;And let not the fancies of women so fairE'er serve thy pleasure in life to impair.

íííí1815.*-----THE BEST.

íííí1815.*-----THE RULE OF LIFE.

ííííIF thou wouldst live unruffled by care,Let not the past torment thee e'er;As little as possible be thou annoy'd,And let the present be ever enjoy'd;Ne'er let thy breast with hate be supplied,And to God the future confide.

íííí1815.*-----THE SAME, EXPANDED.

ííííIF thou wouldst live unruffled by care,Let not the past torment thee e'er;If any loss thou hast to rue,Act as though thou wert born anew;Inquire the meaning of each day,What each day means itself will say;In thine own actions take thy pleasure,What others do, thou'lt duly treasure;Ne'er let thy breast with hate be supplied,And to God the future confide.

íííí-----

ííííIF wealth is gone--then something is gone!

ííííQuick, make up thy mind,

ííííAnd fresh wealth find.If honour is gone--then much is gone!

ííííSeek glory to find,

ííííAnd people then will alter their mind.If courage is gone--then all is gone!'Twere better that thou hadst never been born.

ííííSILENCE deep rules o'er the waters,

íííí1795.-----COURAGE.

ííííCARELESSLY over the plain away,Where by the boldest man no pathCut before thee thou canst discern,Make for thyself a path!

ííííSilence, loved one, my heart!Cracking, let it not break!Breaking, break not with thee!

íííí1776.*-----MY ONLY PROPERTY.

ííííI FEEL that I'm possess'd of nought,Saving the free unfetterd thought

ííííWhich from my bosom seeks to flow,And each propitious passing hourThat suffers me in all its power

ííííA loving fate with truth to know.

íííí1814.-----ADMONITION.

ííííWHEREFORE ever ramble on?

ííííFor the Good is lying near,Fortune learn to seize alone,

ííííFor that Fortune's ever here.

ííííOLD age is courteous--no one more:For time after time he knocks at the door,But nobody says, ""Walk in, sir, pray!""Yet turns he not from the door away,But lifts the latch, and enters with speed.And then they cry ""A cool one, indeed!""

íííí1814.-----EPITAPH.

ííííWEEP ye not, ye children dear,

ííííThat as yet ye are unborn:For each sorrow and each tear

ííííMakes the father's heart to mourn.

ííííPatient be a short time to it,

ííííUnproduced, and known to none;If your father cannot do it,

ííííBy your mother 'twill be done.

íííí1784.-----THE FOOL'S EPILOGUE.

ííííMANY good works I've done and ended,Ye take the praise--I'm not offended;For in the world, I've always thoughtEach thing its true position hath sought.When praised for foolish deeds am I,I set off laughing heartily;When blamed for doing something good,I take it in an easy mood.If some one stronger gives me hard blows,That it's a jest, I feign to suppose:But if 'tis one that's but my own like,I know the way such folks to strike.When Fortune smiles, I merry grow,And sing in dulci jubilo;When sinks her wheel, and tumbles me o'er,I think 'tis sure to rise once more.

ííííIn the sunshine of summer I ne'er lament,Because the winter it cannot prevent;And when the white snow-flakes fall around,I don my skates, and am off with a bound.Though I dissemble as I will,The sun for me will ne'er stand still;The old and wonted course is run,Until the whole of life is done;Each day the servant like the lord,In turns comes home, and goes abroad;If proud or humble the line they take,They all must eat, drink, sleep, and wake.So nothing ever vexes me;Act like the fool, and wise ye'll be!

ííííA DRAGON-FLY with beauteous wingIs hov'ring o'er a silv'ry spring;I watch its motions with delight,--Now dark its colours seem, now bright;Chameleon-like appear, now blue,Now red, and now of greenish hue.Would it would come still nearer me,That I its tints might better see

ííííIt hovers, flutters, resting ne'er!

ííííBut hush! it settles on the mead.I have it safe now, I declare!

ííííAnd when its form I closely view,

íííí'Tis of a sad and dingy blue--Such, Joy-Dissector, is thy case indeed

íííí1767-9.-----EXPLANATION OF AN ANTIQUE GEM,

ííííA YOUNG fig-tree its form lifts high

ííííWithin a beauteous garden;And see, a goat is sitting by.

ííííAs if he were its warden.

ííííBut oh, Quirites, how one errs!

ííííThe tree is guarded badly;For round the other side there whirrs

ííííAnd hums a beetle madly.

ííííThe hero with his well-mail'd coat

ííííNibbles the branches tall so;A mighty longing feels the goat

ííííGently to climb up also.

ííííAnd so, my friends, ere long ye see

ííííThe tree all leafless standing;It looks a type of misery,

ííííHelp of the gods demanding.

ííííThen listen, ye ingenuous youth,

ííííWho hold wise saws respected:From he-goat and from beetles-tooth

ííííA tree should be protected!

ííííWHILE he is mark'd by vision clear

ííííWho fathoms Nature's treasures,The man may follow, void of fear,

ííííWho her proportions measures.

ííííThough for one mortal, it is true,

ííííThese trades may both be fitted,Yet, that the things themselves are two

ííííMust always be admitted.

ííííOnce on a time there lived a cook

ííííWhose skill was past disputing,Who in his head a fancy took

ííííTo try his luck at shooting.

ííííSo, gun in hand, he sought a spot

ííííWhere stores of game were breeding,And there ere long a cat he shot

ííííThat on young birds was feeding.

ííííThis cat he fancied was a hare,

ííííForming a judgment hasty,So served it up for people's fare,

ííííWell-spiced and in a pasty.

ííííYet many a guest with wrath was fill'd

íííí(All who had noses tender):The cat that's by the sportsman kill'd

ííííNo cook a hare can render.

íííí1810.-----LEGEND.

ííííTHERE lived in the desert a holy man

ííííTo whom a goat-footed Faun one dayPaid a visit, and thus began

ííííTo his surprise: ""I entreat thee to prayThat grace to me and my friends may be given,That we may be able to mount to Heaven,For great is our thirst for heav'nly bliss.""The holy man made answer to this:""Much danger is lurking in thy petition,Nor will it be easy to gain admission;Thou dost not come with an angel's salute;For I see thou wearest a cloven foot.""The wild man paused, and then answer'd he:""What doth my goat's foot matter to thee?Full many I've known into heaven to passStraight and with ease, with the head of an ass!""

ííííOVER the meadows, and down the stream,

ííííAnd through the garden-walks straying,He plucks the flowers that fairest seem;

ííííHis throbbing heart brooks no delaying.His maiden then comes--oh, what ecstasy!Thy flowers thou giv'st for one glance of her eye!

ííííThe gard'ner next door o'er the hedge sees the youth:""I'm not such a fool as that, in good truth;My pleasure is ever to cherish each flower,And see that no birds my fruit e'er devour.But when 'tis ripe, your money, good neighbour!'Twas not for nothing I took all this labour!""And such, methinks, are the author-tribe.

ííííThe one his pleasures around him strews,

ííííThat his friends, the public, may reap, if they choose;The other would fain make them all subscribe,

íííí1776.*-----THE CRITIC.

ííííI HAD a fellow as my guest,Not knowing he was such a pest,And gave him just my usual fare;He ate his fill of what was there,

ííííAnd for desert my best things swallow'd,Soon as his meal was o'er, what follow'd?Led by the Deuce, to a neighbour he went,And talk'd of my food to his heart's content:""The soup might surely have had more spice,The meat was ill-brown'd, and the wine wasn't nice.""A thousand curses alight on his head!'Tis a critic, I vow! Let the dog be struck dead!

ííííA BOY a pigeon once possess'd,In gay and brilliant plumage dress'd;He loved it well, and in boyish sportIts food to take from his mouth he taught,And in his pigeon he took such pride,That his joy to others he needs must confide.

ííííAn aged fox near the place chanc'd to dwell,Talkative, clever, and learned as well;The boy his society used to prize,Hearing with pleasure his wonders and lies.

íííí""My friend the fox my pigeon must seeHe ran, and stretch'd 'mongst the bushes lay he""Look, fox, at my pigeon, my pigeon so fair!His equal I'm sure thou hast look'd upon ne'er!""

íííí""Let's see!""--The boy gave it.--""'Tis really not bad;And yet, it is far from complete, I must add.The feathers, for, instance, how short! 'Tis absurd!""So he set to work straightway to pluck the poor bird.

ííííThe boy screamed.--""Thou must now stronger pinions supply,Or else 'twill be ugly, unable to fly.""--Soon 'twas stripp'd--oh, the villain!--and torn all to pieces.The boy was heart-broken,--and so my tale ceases.

íííí*         *         *         *

ííííHe who sees in the boy shadow'd forth his own case,Should be on his guard 'gainst the fox's whole race.

íííí1776.*-----THE WRANGLER.

ííííONE day a shameless and impudent wightWent into a shop full of steel wares bright,Arranged with art upon ev'ry shelf.He fancied they were all meant for himself;And so, while the patient owner stood by,The shining goods needs must handle and try,And valued,--for how should a fool better know?--The bad things high, and the good ones low,And all with an easy self-satisfied face;Then, having bought nothing, he left the place.

ííííThe tradesman now felt sorely vex'd,So when the fellow went there next,A lock of steel made quite red hot.The other cried upon the spot:""Such wares as these, who'd ever buy?the steel is tarnish'd shamefully,""--Then pull'd it, like a fool about,But soon set up a piteous shout.""Pray what's the matter?"" the shopman spoke;The other scream'd: ""Faith, a very cool joke!""

íííí1815.*-----THE YELPERS.

ííííOUR rides in all directions bend,

ííííFor business or for pleasure,Yet yelpings on our steps attend,

ííííAnd barkings without measure.The dog that in our stable dwells,

ííííAfter our heels is striding,And all the while his noisy yells

ííííBut show that we are riding.

íííí1815.*-----THE STORK'S VOCATION.

ííííTHE stork who worms and frogs devours

ííííThat in our ponds reside,Why should he dwell on high church-towers,

ííííWith which he's not allied?

ííííIncessantly he chatters there,

ííííAnd gives our ears no rest;But neither old nor young can dare

ííííTo drive him from his nest.

ííííI humbly ask it,--how can he

ííííGive of his title proof,Save by his happy tendency

ííííTo soil the church's roof?-----CELEBRITY.

íííí[A satire on his own Sorrows of Werther.]

ííííON bridges small and bridges greatStands Nepomucks in ev'ry state,Of bronze, wood, painted, or of stone,Some small as dolls, some giants grown;Each passer must worship before Nepomuck,Who to die on a bridge chanced to have the ill luck,When once a man with head and earsA saint in people's eyes appears,Or has been sentenced piteouslyBeneath the hangman's hand to die,He's as a noted person prized,In portrait is immortalized.Engravings, woodcuts, are supplied,And through the world spread far and wide.Upon them all is seen his name,And ev'ry one admits his claim;Even the image of the LordIs not with greater zeal ador'd.Strange fancy of the human race!Half sinner frail, half child of graceWe see HERR WERTHER of the storyIn all the pomp of woodcut glory.His worth is first made duly known,By having his sad features shownAt ev'ry fair the country round;In ev'ry alehouse too they're found.His stick is pointed by each dunce""The ball would reach his brain at once!""And each says, o'er his beer and bread:""Thank Heav'n that 'tis not we are dead!""

íííí1815.*-----PLAYING AT PRIESTS.

ííííWITHIN a town where parityAccording to old form we see,--That is to say, where CatholicAnd Protestant no quarrels pick,And where, as in his father's day,Each worships God in his own way,We Luth'ran children used to dwell,By songs and sermons taught as well.The Catholic clingclang in truthSounded more pleasing to our youth,For all that we encounter'd there,To us seem'd varied, joyous, fair.As children, monkeys, and mankindTo ape each other are inclin'd,We soon, the time to while away,A game at priests resolved to play.Their aprons all our sisters lentFor copes, which gave us great content;And handkerchiefs, embroider'd o'er,Instead of stoles we also wore;Gold paper, whereon beasts were traced,The bishop's brow as mitre graced.

ííííThrough house and garden thus in stateWe strutted early, strutted late,Repeating with all proper unction,Incessantly each holy function.The best was wanting to the game;

ííííWe knew that a sonorous ring

ííííWas here a most important thing;But Fortune to our rescue came,For on the ground a halter lay;

ííííWe were delighted, and at once

ííííMade it a bellrope for the nonce,And kept it moving all the day;

ííííIn turns each sister and each brother

ííííActed as sexton to another;All help'd to swell the joyous throng;

ííííThe whole proceeded swimmingly,

ííííAnd since no actual bell had we,We all in chorus sang, Ding dong!

íííí*      *      *      *      *

ííííOur guileless child's-sport long was hush'd

ííííIn memory's tomb, like some old lay;And yet across my mind it rush'd

ííííWith pristine force the other day.The New-Poetic CatholicsIn ev'ry point its aptness fix!

íííí1815.*-----SONGS.

ííííSONGS are like painted window-panes!In darkness wrapp'd the church remains,If from the market-place we view it;Thus sees the ignoramus through it.No wonder that he deems it tame,--And all his life 'twill be the same.

ííííBut let us now inside repair,And greet the holy Chapel there!At once the whole seems clear and bright,Each ornament is bathed in light,And fraught with meaning to the sight.God's children! thus your fortune prize,Be edified, and feast your eyes!

íííí1827.*-----POETRY.

ííííGOD to his untaught children sent

ííííLaw, order, knowledge, art, from high,And ev'ry heav'nly favour lent,

ííííThe world's hard lot to qualify.They knew not how they should behave,

ííííFor all from Heav'n stark-naked came;But Poetry their garments gave,

ííííAnd then not one had cause for shame.

íííí1816.-----A PARABLE.

ííííI PICKED a rustic nosegay lately,And bore it homewards, musing greatly;When, heated by my hand, I foundThe heads all drooping tow'rd the ground.I plac'd them in a well-cool'd glass,And what a wonder came to passThe heads soon raised themselves once more.The stalks were blooming as before,And all were in as good a caseAs when they left their native place.

íííí*      *      *      *

ííííSo felt I, when I wond'ring heardMy song to foreign tongues transferr'd.

íííí1828.-----SHOULD E'ER THE LOVELESS DAY.

ííííSHOULD e'er the loveless day remainObscured by storms of hail and rain,

ííííThy charms thou showest never;I tap at window, tap at door:Come, lov'd one, come! appear once more!

ííííThou art as fair as ever!

íííí1827.*-----A PLAN THE MUSES ENTERTAINED.

ííííA PLAN the Muses entertain'd

ííííMethodically to impart

ííííTo Psyche the poetic art;Prosaic-pure her soul remain'd.No wondrous sounds escaped her lyre

ííííE'en in the fairest Summer night;But Amor came with glance of fire,--

ííííThe lesson soon was learn'd aright.

íííí1827.*-----THE DEATH OF THE FLY.

ííííWITH eagerness he drinks the treach'rous potion,

ííííNor stops to rest, by the first taste misled;Sweet is the draught, but soon all power of motion

ííííHe finds has from his tender members fled;No longer has he strength to plume his wing,No longer strength to raise his head, poor thing!E'en in enjoyment's hour his life he loses,His little foot to bear his weight refuses;So on he sips, and ere his draught is o'er,Death veils his thousand eyes for evermore.

íííí1810.-----BY THE RIVER.

ííííWHEN by the broad stream thou dost dwell,

ííííOft shallow is its sluggish flood;Then, when thy fields thou tendest well,

ííííIt o'er them spreads its slime and mud.

ííííThe ships descend ere daylight wanes,

ííííThe prudent fisher upward goes;Round reef and rock ice casts its chains,

ííííAnd boys at will the pathway close.

ííííTo this attend, then, carefully,

ííííAnd what thou wouldst, that execute!Ne'er linger, ne'er o'erhasty be,

ííííFor time moves on with measured foot.

íííí1821.*-----THE FOX AND CRANE.

ííííONCE two persons uninvited

ííííCame to join my dinner table;For the nonce they lived united,

ííííFox and crane yclept in fable.

ííííCivil greetings pass'd between us

ííííThen I pluck'd some pigeons tenderFor the fox of jackal-genius,

ííííAdding grapes in full-grown splendour.

ííííLong-neck'd flasks I put as dishes

ííííFor the crane, without delaying,Fill'd with gold and silver fishes,

ííííIn the limpid water playing.

ííííHad ye witness'd Reynard planted

ííííAt his flat plate, all demurely,Ye with envy must have granted:

íííí""Ne'er was such a gourmand, surely!""

ííííWhile the bird with circumspection

ííííOn one foot, as usual, cradled,From the flasks his fish-refection

ííííWith his bill and long neck ladled.

ííííOne the pigeons praised,--the other,

ííííAs they went, extoll'd the fishes,Each one scoffing at his brother

ííííFor preferring vulgar dishes.

íííí*        *        *

ííííIf thou wouldst preserve thy credit,

ííííWhen thou askest folks to guzzleAt thy hoard, take care to spread it

ííííSuited both for bill and muzzle.

íííí1819.-----THE FOX AND HUNTSMAN.

ííííHARD 'tis on a fox's traces

ííííTo arrive, midst forest-glades;Hopeless utterly the chase is,

ííííIf his flight the huntsman aids.

ííííAnd so 'tis with many a wonder,

íííí(Why A B make Ab in fact,)Over which we gape and blunder,

ííííAnd our head and brains distract.

íííí1821.*-----THE FROGS.

ííííA POOL was once congeal'd with frost;The frogs, in its deep waters lost,

ííííNo longer dared to croak or spring;But promised, being half asleep,If suffer'd to the air to creep,

ííííAs very nightingales to sing.

ííííA thaw dissolved the ice so strong,--They proudly steer'd themselves along,When landed, squatted on the shore,And croak'd as loudly as before.

íííí1821.*-----THE WEDDING.

ííííA FEAST was in a village spread,--It was a wedding-day, they said.The parlour of the inn I found,And saw the couples whirling round,Each lass attended by her lad,And all seem'd loving, blithe, and glad;

ííííBut on my asking for the bride,A fellow with a stare, replied:""'Tis not the place that point to raise!

ííííWe're only dancing in her honour;We now have danced three nights and days,

ííííAnd not bestowed one thought upon her.""

íííí*      *      *      *

ííííWhoe'er in life employs his eyesSuch cases oft will recognise.

íííí1821.*-----BURIAL.

ííííTo the grave one day from a house they bore

ííííA maiden;To the window the citizens went to explore;In splendour they lived, and with wealth as of yore

ííííTheir banquets were laden.Then thought they: ""The maid to the tomb is now borne;We too from our dwellings ere long must be torn,And he that is left our departure to mourn,

ííííTo our riches will be the successor,

ííííFor some one must be their possessor.

íííí1827.*-----THREATENING SIGNS.

ííííIF Venus in the evening skyIs seen in radiant majesty,If rod-like comets, red as blood,Are 'mongst the constellations view'd,Out springs the Ignoramus, yelling:""The star's exactly o'er my dwelling!What woeful prospect, ah, for me!Then calls his neighbour mournfully:""Behold that awful sign of evil,Portending woe to me, poor devil!My mother's asthma ne'er will leave her,My child is sick with wind and fever;I dread the illness of my wife,A week has pass'd, devoid of strife,--And other things have reach'd my ear;The Judgment Day has come, I fear!""

ííííHis neighbour answered: ""Friend, you're right!Matters look very had to-night.Let's go a street or two, though, hence,And gaze upon the stars from thence.""--No change appears in either case.Let each remain then in his place,And wisely do the best he can,Patient as any other man.

íííí1821.*-----THE BUYERS.

ííííTo an apple-woman's stall

ííííOnce some children nimbly ran;Longing much to purchase all,They with joyous haste beganSnatching up the piles there raised,While with eager eyes they gazedOn the rosy fruit so nice;But when they found out the price,Down they threw the whole they'd got,Just as if they were red hot.

íííí*      *      *      *      *

ííííThe man who gratis will his goods supplyWill never find a lack of folks to buy!

íííí1820.-----THE MOUNTAIN VILLAGE.

íííí""THE mountain village was destroy'd;But see how soon is fill'd the void!Shingles and boards, as by magic arise,The babe in his cradle and swaddling-clothes lies;How blest to trust to God's protection!""

ííííBehold a wooden new erection,So that, if sparks and wind but choose,God's self at such a game must lose!

íííí1821.*-----SYMBOLS.

ííííPALM Sunday at the Vatican

ííííThey celebrate with palms;With reverence bows each holy man,

ííííAnd chaunts the ancient psalms.Those very psalms are also sung

ííííWith olive boughs in hand,While holly, mountain wilds among,

ííííIn place of palms must stand:In fine, one seeks some twig that's green,

ííííAnd takes a willow rod,So that the pious man may e'en

ííííIn small things praise his God.

ííííAnd if ye have observed it well,

ííííTo gain what's fit ye're able,If ye in faith can but excel;

ííííSuch are the myths of fable.

íííí1827.*-----THREE PALINODIAS.

ííííI.

íííí""Incense is hut a tribute for the gods,--To mortals 'tis but poison.""

ííííTHE smoke that from thine altar blows,

ííííCan it the gods offend?For I observe thou hold'st thy nose--

ííííPray what does this portend?Mankind deem incense to excel

ííííEach other earthly thing,So he that cannot bear its smell,

ííííNo incense e'er should bring.

ííííWith unmoved face by thee at least

ííííTo dolls is homage given;If not obstructed by the priest,

ííííThe scent mounts up to heaven.

íííí1827.*

ííííII

ííííCONFLICT OF WIT AND BEAUTY.

ííííSIR Wit, who is so much esteem'd,

ííííAnd who is worthy of all honour,Saw Beauty his superior deem'd

ííííBy folks who loved to gaze upon her;At this he was most sorely vex'd.

ííííThen came Sir Breath (long known as fit

ííííTo represent the cause of wit),

ííííBeginning, rudely, I admit,To treat the lady with a text.To this she hearken'd not at all,But hasten'd to his principal:""None are so wise, they say, as you,--Is not the world enough for two?

ííííIf you are obstinate, good-bye!If wise, to love me you will try,For be assured the world can ne'erGive birth to a more handsome pair.""

íííí1827.*

íííí=====

ííííFAIR daughters were by Beauty rear'd,

ííííWit had but dull sons for his lot;So for a season it appear'd

ííííBeauty was constant, Wit was not.But Wit's a native of the soil,

ííííSo he return'd, work'd, strove amain,And found--sweet guerdon for his toil!--

ííííBeauty to quicken him again.

íííí1827.*

ííííIII.

ííííRAIN AND RAINBOW.

ííííDURING a heavy storm it chancedThat from his room a cockney glancedAt the fierce tempest as it broke,While to his neighbour thus he spoke:""The thunder has our awe inspired,Our barns by lightning have been fired,--Our sins to punish, I suppose;But in return, to soothe our woes,See how the rain in torrents fell,Making the harvest promise well!But is't a rainbow that I spyExtending o'er the dark-grey sky?With it I'm sure we may dispense,The colour'd cheat! The vain pretence!""Dame Iris straightway thus replied:""Dost dare my beauty to deride?In realms of space God station'd meA type of better worlds to beTo eyes that from life's sorrows roveIn cheerful hope to Heav'n above,And, through the mists that hover hereGod and his precepts blest revere.Do thou, then, grovel like the swine,And to the ground thy snout confine,But suffer the enlighten'd eyeTo feast upon my majesty.""

íííí1827.*

ííííVALEDICTION.

ííííI ONCE was fond of fools,

ííííAnd bid them come each day;Then each one brought his tools

ííííThe carpenter to play;The roof to strip first choosing,

ííííAnother to supply,The wood as trestles using,

ííííTo move it by-and-by,While here and there they ran,

ííííAnd knock'd against each other;To fret I soon began,

ííííMy anger could not smother,So cried, ""Get out, ye fools!""

ííííAt this they were offendedThen each one took his tools,

ííííAnd so our friendship ended.

ííííSince that, I've wiser been,

ííííAnd sit beside my door;When one of them is seen,

ííííI cry, ""Appear no more!""""Hence, stupid knave!"" I bellow:

ííííAt this he's angry too:""You impudent old fellow!

ííííAnd pray, sir, who are you?Along the streets we riot,

ííííAnd revel at the fair;But yet we're pretty quiet,

ííííAnd folks revile us ne'er.Don't call us names, then, please!""--At length I meet with ease,

ííííFor now they leave my door--'Tis better than before!

íííí1827.*-----THE COUNTRY SCHOOLMASTER.

ííííI.

ííííA MASTER of a country schoolJump'd up one day from off his stool,Inspired with firm resolve to tryTo gain the best society;So to the nearest baths he walk'd,And into the saloon he stalk'd.He felt quite. startled at the door,Ne'er having seen the like before.To the first stranger made he nowA very low and graceful bow,But quite forgot to bear in mindThat people also stood behind;His left-hand neighbor's paunch he struckA grievous blow, by great ill luck;Pardon for this he first entreated,And then in haste his bow repeated.His right hand neighbor next he hit,And begg'd him, too, to pardon it;But on his granting his petition,Another was in like condition;These compliments he paid to all,Behind, before, across the hall;At length one who could stand no more,Show'd him impatiently the door.

íííí*      *      *      *

ííííMay many, pond'ring on their crimes,A moral draw from this betimes!

ííííII.

ííííAs he proceeded on his wayHe thought, ""I was too weak to-day;To bow I'll ne'er again be seen;For goats will swallow what is green.""Across the fields he now must speed,Not over stumps and stones, indeed,But over meads and cornfields sweet,Trampling down all with clumsy feet.A farmer met him by-and-by,And didn't ask him: how? or why?But with his fist saluted him.

íííí""I feel new life in every limb!""Our traveller cried in ecstasy.""Who art thou who thus gladden'st me?May Heaven such blessings ever send!Ne'er may I want a jovial friend!""

íííí1808.*-----THE LEGEND OF THE HORSESHOE.

ííííWHAT time our Lord still walk'd the earth,Unknown, despised, of humble birth,And on Him many a youth attended(His words they seldom comprehended),It ever seem'd to Him most meetTo hold His court in open street,As under heaven's broad canopyOne speaks with greater liberty.The teachings of His blessed wordFrom out His holy mouth were heard;Each market to a fane turn'd HeWith parable and simile.

ííííOne day, as tow'rd a town He roved,In peace of mind with those He loved,Upon the path a something gleam'd;A broken horseshoe 'twas, it seem'd.So to St. Peter thus He spake:""That piece of iron prythee take!""St. Peter's thoughts had gone astray,--He had been musing on his wayRespecting the world's government,A dream that always gives content,For in the head 'tis check'd by nought;This ever was his dearest thought,For him this prize was far too meanHad it a crown and sceptre been!But, surely, 'twasn't worth the troubleFor half a horseshoe to bend double!And so he turn'd away his head,As if he heard not what was said,

ííííThe Lord, forbearing tow'rd all men,Himself pick'd up the horseshoe then(He ne'er again like this stoop'd down).And when at length they reach'd the town,Before a smithy He remain'd,And there a penny for 't obtain'd.As they the market-place went by,Some beauteous cherries caught His eye:Accordingly He bought as manyAs could be purchased for a penny,And then, as oft His wont had been,Placed them within His sleeve unseen.

ííííThey went out by another gate,O'er plains and fields proceeding straight,No house or tree was near the spot,The sun was bright, the day was hot;In short, the weather being such,A draught of water was worth much.The Lord walk'd on before them all,And let, unseen, a cherry fall.St. Peter rush'd to seize it hold,As though an apple 'twere of gold;His palate much approv'd the berry;The Lord ere long another cherryOnce more let fall upon the plain;St. Peter forthwith stoop'd again.The Lord kept making him thus bendTo pick up cherries without end.For a long time the thing went on;The Lord then said, in cheerful tone:""Had'st thou but moved when thou wert bid,Thou of this trouble had'st been rid;The man who small things scorns, will next,By things still smaller be perplex'd.""

ííííYonder, within those walls we live.My father 'twas who built the cottageOf tiles and stones from out the ruins.'Tis here we dwell.He gave me to a husbandman,And in our arms expired.--Hast thou been sleeping, dearest heartHow lively, and how full of play!Sweet rogue!

ííííWANDERER.

ííííNature, thou ever budding one,Thou formest each for life's enjoyments,And, like a mother, all thy children dear,Blessest with that sweet heritage,--a homeThe swallow builds the cornice round,Unconscious of the beautiesShe plasters up.The caterpillar spins around the bough,To make her brood a winter house;And thou dost patch, between antiquity'sMost glorious relics,For thy mean use,Oh man, a humble cot,--Enjoyest e'en mid tombs!--Farewell, thou happy woman!

ííííWOMAN.

ííííThou wilt not stay, then?

ííííWANDERER.

ííííMay God preserve thee,And bless thy boy!

ííííWOMAN.

ííííA happy journey!

ííííWhither conducts the pathAcross yon hill?

ííííWOMAN.

ííííTo Cuma.

ííííWANDERER.

ííííHow far from hence?

ííííWOMAN.

íííí'Tis full three miles.

ííííWANDERER.

ííííFarewell!Oh Nature, guide me on my way!The wandering stranger guide,Who o'er the tombsOf holy bygone timesIs passing,To a kind sheltering place,From North winds safe,And where a poplar groveShuts out the noontide ray!And when I comeHome to my cotAt evening,Illumined by the setting sun,Let me embrace a wife like this,Her infant in her arms!

íííí1772.* Compare with the beautiful description contained in thesubsequent lines, an account of a ruined temple of Ceres, givenby Chamberlayne in his Pharonnida (published in 1659)

íííí"".... With mournful majesiyA heap of solitary ruins lie,Half sepulchred in dust, the bankrupt heirTo prodigal antiquity....""-----LOVE AS A LANDSCAPE PAINTER.

ííííON a rocky peak once sat I early,Gazing on the mist with eyes unmoving;Stretch'd out like a pall of greyish texture,All things round, and all above it cover'd.

ííííSuddenly a boy appear'd beside me,Saying ""Friend, what meanest thou by gazingOn the vacant pall with such composure?Hast thou lost for evermore all pleasureBoth in painting cunningly, and forming?""On the child I gazed, and thought in secret:""Would the boy pretend to be a master?""

íííí""Wouldst thou be for ever dull and idle,""Said the boy, ""no wisdom thou'lt attain to;See, I'll straightway paint for thee a figure,--How to paint a beauteous figure, show thee.""

ííííAnd he then extended his fore-finger,--(Ruddy was it as a youthful rosebud)Tow'rd the broad and far outstretching carpet,And began to draw there with his finger.

ííííFirst on high a radiant sun he painted,Which upon mine eyes with splendour glisten'd,And he made the clouds with golden border,Through the clouds he let the sunbeams enter;Painted then the soft and feathery summitsOf the fresh and quicken'd trees, behind themOne by one with freedom drew the mountains;Underneath he left no lack of water,But the river painted so like Nature,That it seem'd to glitter in the sunbeams,That it seem'd against its banks to murmur.

ííííAh, there blossom'd flowers beside the river,And bright colours gleam'd upon the meadow,Gold, and green, and purple, and enamell'd,All like carbuncles and emeralds seeming!

ííííBright and clear he added then the heavens,And the blue-tinged mountains far and farther,So that I, as though newborn, enrapturedGazed on, now the painter, now the picture.

ííííThen spake he: ""Although I have convinced theeThat this art I understand full surely,Yet the hardest still is left to show thee.""

ííííThereupon he traced, with pointed finger,And with anxious care, upon the forest,At the utmost verge, where the strong sunbeamsFrom the shining ground appear'd reflected,

ííííTraced the figure of a lovely maiden,Fair in form, and clad in graceful fashion,Fresh the cheeks beneath her brown locks' ambush,And the cheeks possess'd the selfsame colourAs the finger that had served to paint them.

íííí""Oh thou boy!"" exclaim'd I then, ""what masterIn his school received thee as his pupil,Teaching thee so truthfully and quicklyWisely to begin, and well to finish?""

ííííWhilst I still was speaking, lo, a zephyrSoftly rose, and set the tree-tops moving,Curling all the wavelets on the river,And the perfect maiden's veil, too, fill'd it,And to make my wonderment still greater,Soon the maiden set her foot in motion.On she came, approaching tow'rd the stationWhere still sat I with my arch instructor.

ííííAs now all, yes, all thus moved together,--Flowers, river, trees, the veil,--all moving,--And the gentle foot of that most fair one,Can ye think that on my rock I linger'd,Like a rock, as though fast-chain'd and silent?

íííí1816.-----THE METAMORPHOSIS OF PLANTS.

ííííTHOU art confused, my beloved, at, seeing the thousandfold union

ííííShown in this flowery troop, over the garden dispers'd;any a name dost thou hear assign'd; one after another

ííííFalls on thy list'ning ear, with a barbarian sound.None resembleth another, yet all their forms have a likeness;

ííííTherefore, a mystical law is by the chorus proclaim'd;Yes, a sacred enigma! Oh, dearest friend, could I only

ííííHappily teach thee the word, which may the mystery solve!Closely observe how the plant, by little and little progressing,

ííííStep by step guided on, changeth to blossom and fruit!First from the seed it unravels itself, as soon as the silent

ííííFruit-bearing womb of the earth kindly allows Its escape,And to the charms of the light, the holy, the ever-in-motion,

ííííTrusteth the delicate leaves, feebly beginning to shoot.Simply slumber'd the force in the seed; a germ of the future,

ííííPeacefully lock'd in itself, 'neath the integument lay,Leaf and root, and bud, still void of colour, and shapeless;

ííííThus doth the kernel, while dry, cover that motionless life.Upward then strives it to swell, in gentle moisture confiding,

ííííAnd, from the night where it dwelt, straightway ascendeth to light.Yet still simple remaineth its figure, when first it appeareth;

ííííAnd 'tis a token like this, points out the child 'mid the plants.Soon a shoot, succeeding it, riseth on high, and reneweth,

ííííPiling-up node upon node, ever the primitive form;Yet not ever alike: for the following leaf, as thou seest,

ííííEver produceth itself, fashioned in manifold ways.Longer, more indented, in points and in parts more divided,

ííííWhich. all-deform'd until now, slept in the organ below,So at length it attaineth the noble and destined perfection,

ííííWhich, in full many a tribe, fills thee with wondering awe.Many ribb'd and tooth'd, on a surface juicy and swelling,

ííííFree and unending the shoot seemeth in fullness to be;Yet here Nature restraineth, with powerful hands, the formation,

ííííAnd to a perfecter end, guideth with softness its growth,Less abundantly yielding the sap, contracting the vessels,

ííííSo that the figure ere long gentler effects doth disclose.Soon and in silence is check'd the growth of the vigorous branches,

ííííAnd the rib of the stalk fuller becometh in form.Leafless, however, and quick the tenderer stem then up-springeth,

ííííAnd a miraculous sight doth the observer enchant.Ranged in a circle, in numbers that now are small, and now countless,

ííííGather the smaller-sized leaves, close by the side of their like.Round the axis compress'd the sheltering calyx unfoldeth,

ííííAnd, as the perfectest type, brilliant-hued coronals forms.Thus doth Nature bloom, in glory still nobler and fuller,

ííííShowing, in order arranged, member on member uprear'd.Wonderment fresh dost thou feel, as soon as the stem rears the flower

ííííOver the scaffolding frail of the alternating leaves.But this glory is only the new creation's foreteller,

ííííYes, the leaf with its hues feeleth the hand all divine,And on a sudden contracteth itself; the tenderest figures

ííííTwofold as yet, hasten on, destined to blend into one.Lovingly now the beauteous pairs are standing together,

ííííGather'd in countless array, there where the altar is raised.Hymen hovereth o'er them, and scents delicious and mighty

ííííStream forth their fragrance so sweet, all things enliv'ning around.Presently, parcell'd out, unnumber'd germs are seen swelling,

ííííSweetly conceald in the womb, where is made perfect the fruit.Here doth Nature close the ring of her forces eternal;

ííííYet doth a new one, at once, cling to the one gone before,So that the chain be prolonged for ever through all generations,

ííííAnd that the whole may have life, e'en as enjoy'd by each part.Now, my beloved one, turn thy gaze on the many-hued thousands

ííííWhich, confusing no more, gladden the mind as they wave.Every plant unto thee proclaimeth the laws everlasting,

ííííEvery flowered speaks louder and louder to thee;But if thou here canst decipher the mystic words of the goddess,

ííííEverywhere will they be seen, e'en though the features are changed.Creeping insects may linger, the eager butterfly hasten,--

ííííPlastic and forming, may man change e'en the figure decreed!Oh, then, bethink thee, as well, how out of the germ of acquaintance,

ííííKindly intercourse sprang, slowly unfolding its leaves;Soon how friendship with might unveil'd itself in our bosoms,

ííííAnd how Amor, at length, brought forth blossom and fruitThink of the manifold ways wherein Nature hath lent to our feelings,

ííííSilently giving them birth, either the first or the last!Yes, and rejoice in the present day! For love that is holy

ííííSeeketh the noblest of fruits,--that where the thoughts are the same,Where the opinions agree,--that the pair may, in rapt contemplation,

ííííLovingly blend into one,--find the more excellent world.

íííí-----THOUGHTS ON JESUS CHRIST'S DESCENT INTO HELL.

íííí[THE remarkable Poem of which this is a literal but faintrepresentation, was written when Goethe was only sixteen yearsold. It derives additional interest from the fact of its beingthe very earliest piece of his that is preserved. The few otherpieces included by Goethe under the title of Religion and Churchare polemical, and devoid of interest to the English reader.]

ííííWHAT wondrous noise is heard around!Through heaven exulting voices sound,

ííííA mighty army marches onBy thousand millions follow'd, lo,To yon dark place makes haste to go

ííííGod's Son, descending from His throne!He goes--the tempests round Him break,

ííííAs Judge and Hero cometh He;He goes--the constellations quake,

ííííThe sun, the world quake fearfully.

ííííI see Him in His victor-car,On fiery axles borne afar,

ííííWho on the cross for us expired.The triumph to yon realms He shows,--Remote from earth, where star ne'er glows,

ííííThe triumph He for us acquired.He cometh, Hell to extirpate,

ííííWhom He, by dying, wellnigh kill'd;He shall pronounce her fearful fate

ííííHark! now the curse is straight fulfill'd.

ííííHell sees the victor come at last,She feels that now her reign is past,

ííííShe quakes and fears to meet His sight;She knows His thunders' terrors dread,In vain she seeks to hide her head,

ííííAttempts to fly, but vain is flight;Vainly she hastes to 'scape pursuit

ííííAnd to avoid her Judge's eye;The Lord's fierce wrath restrains her foot

ííííLike brazen chains,--she cannot fly.

ííííHere lies the Dragon, trampled down,He lies, and feels God's angry frown,

ííííHe feels, and grinneth hideously;He feels Hell's speechless agonies,A thousand times he howls and sighs:

íííí""Oh, burning flames! quick, swallow me!""There lies he in the fiery waves,

ííííBy torments rack'd and pangs infernal,Instant annihilation craves,

ííííAnd hears, those pangs will be eternal.

ííííThose mighty squadrons, too, are here,The partners of his cursed career,

ííííYet far less bad than he were they.Here lies the countless throng combined,In black and fearful crowds entwined,

ííííWhile round him fiery tempests play;He sees how they the Judge avoid,

ííííHe sees the storm upon them feed,Yet is not at the sight o'erjoy'd,

ííííBecause his pangs e'en theirs exceed.

ííííThe Son of Man in triumph passesDown to Hell's wild and black morasses,

ííííAnd there unfolds His majesty.Hell cannot bear the bright array,For, since her first created day.

ííííDarkness alone e'er govern'd she.She lay remote from ev'ry light

ííííWith torments fill'd in Chaos here;God turn'd for ever from her sight

ííííHis radiant features' glory clear.

ííííWithin the realms she calls her own,She sees the splendour of the Son,

ííííHis dreaded glories shining forth;She sees Him clad in rolling thunder,She sees the rocks all quake with wonder,

ííííWhen God before her stands in wrath.She sees He comes her Judge to be,

ííííShe feels the awful pangs inside her,Herself to slay endeavours she,

ííííBut e'en this comfort is denied her.

ííííNow looks she back, with pains untold,Upon those happy times of old,

ííííWhen those glories gave her joy;When yet her heart revered the truth,When her glad soul, in endless youth

ííííAnd rapture dwelt, without alloy.She calls to mind with madden'd thought

ííííHow over man her wiles prevail'd;To take revenge on God she sought,

ííííAnd feels the vengeance it entail'd.

ííííGod was made man, and came to earth.Then Satan cried with fearful mirth:

íííí""E'en He my victim now shall be!""He sought to slay the Lord Most High,The world's Creator now must die;

ííííBut, Satan, endless woe to thee!Thou thought'st to overcome Him then,

ííííRejoicing in His suffering;But he in triumph comes again

ííííTo bind thee: Death! where is thy sting?

ííííSpeak, Hell! where is thy victory?Thy power destroy'd and scatter'd see!

ííííKnow'st thou not now the Highest's might?See, Satan, see thy rule o'erthrown!

ííííBy thousand-varying pangs weigh'd down,Thou dwell'st in dark and endless night.

ííííAs though by lightning struck thou liest,No gleam of rapture far or wide;

ííííIn vain! no hope thou there decriest,--For me alone Messiah died!

ííííA howling rises through the air,A trembling fills each dark vault there,

ííííWhen Christ to Hell is seen to come.She snarls with rage, but needs must cowerBefore our mighty hero's power;

ííííHe signs--and Hell is straightway dumb.Before his voice the thunders break,

ííííOn high His victor-banner blows;E'en angels at His fury quake,

ííííWhen Christ to the dread judgment goes.

ííííNow speaks He, and His voice is thunder,He speaks, the rocks are rent in sunder,

ííííHis breath is like devouring flames.Thus speaks He: ""Tremble, ye accurs'd!He who from Eden hurl'd you erst,

ííííYour kingdom's overthrow proclaims.Look up! My children once were ye,

ííííYour arms against Me then ye turn'd,Ye fell, that ye might sinners be,

ííííYe've now the wages that ye earn'd.

íííí""My greatest foeman from that day,Ye led my dearest friends astray,--

ííííAs ye had fallen, man must fall.To kill him evermore ye sought,'They all shall die the death,' ye thought;

ííííBut howl! for Me I won them all.For them alone did I descend,

ííííFor them pray'd, suffer'd, perish'd I.Ye ne'er shall gain your wicked end;

ííííWho trusts in Me shall never die.

íííí""In endless chains here lie ye now,Nothing can save you from the slough.

ííííNot boldness, not regret for crime.Lie, then, and writhe in brimstone fire!'Twas ye yourselves drew down Mine ire,

ííííLie and lament throughout all time!And also ye, whom I selected,

ííííE'en ye forever I disown,For ye My saving grace rejected

ííííYe murmur? blame yourselves alone!

íííí""Ye might have lived with Me in bliss,For I of yore had promis'd this;

ííííYe sinn'd, and all My precepts slightedWrapp'd in the sleep of sin ye dwelt,Now is My fearful judgment felt,

ííííBy a just doom your guilt requited.""--Thus spake He, and a fearful storm

ííííFrom Him proceeds, the lightnings glow,The thunders seize each wicked form,

ííííAnd hurl them in the gulf below.

ííííThe God-man closeth Hell's sad doors,In all His majesty He soars

ííííFrom those dark regions back to light.He sitteth at the Father's side;Oh, friends, what joy doth this betide!

ííííFor us, for us He still will fight!The angels sacred quire around

ííííRejoice before the mighty Lord,So that all creatures hear the sound:

ííííEARLY one day, the Muse, when eagerly bent on adornment,Follow'd a swift-running streamlet, the quietest nook by it seeking.Quickly and noisily flowing, the changeful surface distortedEver her moving form; the goddess departed in anger.Yet the stream call'd mockingly after her, saying: ""What, truly!Wilt thou not view, then, the truth, in my mirror so clearly depicted?""But she already was far away, on the brink of the ocean,In her figure rejoicing, and duly arranging her garland.

íííí1799.*-----PHOEBUS AND HERMES.

ííííDELOS' stately ruler, and Maia's son, the adroit one,

ííííWarmly were striving, for both sought the great prize to obtain.Hermes the lyre demanded, the lyre was claim'd by Apollo,

ííííYet were the hearts of the foes fruitlessly nourish'd by hope.For on a sudden Ares burst in, with fury decisive,

ííííDashing in twain the gold toy, brandishing wildly his sword.Hermes, malicious one, laughed beyond measure; yet deep-seated sorrow

ííííSeized upon Phoebus's heart, seized on the heart of each Muse.

íííí1799.*-----THE NEW AMOR.

ííííAMOR, not the child, the youthful lover of Psyche,Look'd round Olympus one day, boldly, to triumph inured;There  he espied a goddess, the fairest amongst the immortals,--Venus Urania she,--straight was his passion inflamed.Even the holy one powerless proved, alas! 'gainst his wooing,--Tightly embraced in his arm, held her the daring one fast.Then from their union arose a new, a more beauteous Amor,Who from his father his wit, grace from his mother derives.Ever thou'lt find him join'd in the kindly Muses' communion,And his charm-laden bolt foundeth the love of the arts.

íííí1792.-----THE GARLANDS.

ííííKLOPSTOCK would lead us away from Pindus; no longer for laurelMay we be eager--the homely acorn alone must content us;Yet he himself his more-than-epic crusade is conductingHigh on Golgotha's summit, that foreign gods he may honour!Yet, on what hill he prefers, let him gather the angels together,Suffer deserted disciples to weep o'er the grave of the just one:There where a hero and saint hath died, where a bard breath'd his numbers,Both for our life and our death an ensample of courage resplendentAnd of the loftiest human worth to bequeath,--ev'ry nationThere will joyously kneel in devotion ecstatic, reveringThorn and laurel garland, and all its charms and its tortures.

ííííSeem, in that silent domain, still to be gladdend with life.Thus may the minstrel's sarcophagus be hereafter surrounded

ííííWith such a scroll, which himself richly with life has adorn'd.-----CLASP'D in my arms for ever eagerly hold I my mistress,

ííííEver my panting heart throbs wildly against her dear breast,And on her knees forever is leaning my head, while I'm gazing

ííííNow  on her sweet-smiling mouth, now on her bright sparkling eyes.""Oh thou effeminate!"" spake one, ""and thus, then, thy days thou

ííííart spending?""

ííííAh, they in sorrow are spent. List while I tell thee my tale:Yes! I have left my only joy in life far behind me,

ííííTwenty long days hath my car borne me away from her sight.Vettrini defy me, while crafty chamberlains flatter,

ííííAnd the sly Valet de place thinks but of lies and deceit.If I attempt to escape, the Postmaster fastens upon me,

ííííPostboys the upper hand get, custom-house duties enrage.""Truly, I can't understand thee! thou talkest enigmas! thou seemest

ííííWrapp'd in a blissful repose, glad as Rinaldo of yore:Ah, I  myself understand full well; 'tis my body that travels,

ííííAnd 'tis my spirit that rests still in my mistress's arms.-----I WOULD liken this gondola unto the soft-rocking cradle,

ííííAnd the chest on its deck seems a vast coffin to be.Yes! 'tween the cradle and coffin, we totter and waver for ever

ííííOn the mighty canal, careless our lifetime is spent.-----WHY are the people thus busily moving? For food they are seeking,

ííííChildren they fain would beget, feeding them well as they can.Traveller, mark this well, and when thou art home, do thou likewise!

ííííMore can no mortal effect, work with what ardour he will.-----I WOULD compare to the land this anvil, its lord to the hammer,

ííííAnd to the people the plate, which in the middle is bent.Sad is the poor tin-plate's lot, when the blows are but given at random:

ííííNe'er will the kettle be made, while they uncertainly fall.-----WHAT is the life of a man? Yet thousands are ever accustom'dFreely to talk about man,--what he has done, too, and how.Even less is a poem; yet thousands read and enjoy it,Thousands abuse it.--My friend, live and continue to rhyme!-----MERRY'S the trade of a poet; but somewhat a dear one, I fear me

ííííFor, as my book grows apace, all of my sequins I lose.-----Is' thou'rt in earnest, no longer delay, but render me happy;Art thou in jest? Ah, sweet love! time for all jesting is past.-----ART thou, then, vex'd at my silence? What shall I speak of? Thou markest

ííííNeither my sorrowful sigh, nor my soft eloquent look.Only one goddess is able the seal of my lips to unloosen,--

ííííWhen by Aurora I'm found, slumbering calm on thy breast.Ah, then my hymn in the ears of the earliest gods shall be chaunted,

ííííAs the Memnonian form breath'd forth sweet secrets in song.-----IN the twilight of morning to climb to the top of the mountain,--

ííííThee to salute, kindly star, earliest herald of day,--And to await, with impatience, the gaze of the ruler of heaven,--

ííííYouthful delight, oh oft lur'st thou me out in the night!Oh ye heralds of day, ye heavenly eyes of my mistress,

ííííNow ye appear, and the sun evermore riseth too soon.-----THOU art amazed, and dost point to the ocean. It seems to be burning,Flame-crested billows in play dart round our night-moving bark.Me it astonisheth not,--of the ocean was born Aphrodite,--Did not a flame, too, proceed from her for us, in her son?-----GLEAMING the ocean appear'd, the beauteous billows were smiling,

ííííWhile a fresh, favouring wind, filling the sails, drove us on.Free was my bosom from yearning; yet soon my languishing glances

ííííTurn'd themselves backward in haste, seeking the snow-cover'd hills.Treasures unnumber'd are southwards lying. Yet one to the northwards

ííííDraws me resistlessly back, like the strong magnet in force.-----SPACIOUS and fair is the world; yet oh! how I thank the kind heavens

ííííThat I a garden possess, small though it be, yet mine own.One which enticeth me homewards; why should a gardener wander?

ííííHonour and pleasure he finds, when to his garden he looks.-----AH, my maiden is going! she mounts the vessel! My monarch,

ííííAEolus! potentate dread! keep ev'ry storm far away!""Oh, thou fool!"" cried the god:""ne'er fear the blustering tempest;

ííííWhen Love flutters his wings, then mayst thou dread the soft breeze.""-----

ííííELEGIES.

íííí-----PART I.

ííííROMAN ELEGIES.

íííí[The Roman Elegies were written in the same year as the VenetianEpigrams--viz. 1790.]

ííííSPEAK, ye stones, I entreat! Oh speak, ye palaces lofty!

ííííUtter a word, oh ye streets! Wilt thou not, Genius, awake?All that thy sacred walls, eternal Rome, hold within them

ííííTeemeth with life; but to me, all is still silent and dead.Oh, who will whisper unto me,--when shall I see at the casement

ííííThat one beauteous form, which, while it scorcheth, revives?Can I as yet not discern the road, on which I for ever

ííííTo her and from her shall go, heeding not time as it flies?Still do I mark the churches, palaces, ruins, and columns,

ííííAs a wise traveller should, would he his journey improve.Soon all this will be past; and then will there be but one temple,

ííííAmor's temple alone, where the Initiate may go.Thou art indeed a world, oh Rome; and yet, were Love absent,

ííííThen would the world be no world, then would e'en Rome be no Rome.-----Do not repent, mine own love, that thou so soon didst surrender

ííííTrust me, I deem thee not bold! reverence only I feel.Manifold workings the darts of Amor possess; some but scratching,

ííííYet with insidious effect, poison the bosom for years.Others mightily feather'd, with fresh and newly-born sharpness

ííííPierce to the innermost bone, kindle the blood into flame.In the heroical times, when loved each god and each goddess,

ííííLonging attended on sight; then with fruition was bless'd.Think'st thou the goddess had long been thinking of love and its pleasures

ííííWhen she, in Ida's retreats, own'd to Anchises her flame?Had but Luna delayd to kiss the beautiful sleeper,

ííííOh, by Aurora, ere long, he had in envy been rous'd!Hero Leander espied at the noisy feast, and the lover

ííííHotly and nimbly, ere long, plunged in the night-cover'd flood.Rhea Silvia, virgin princess, roam'd near the Tiber,

ííííSeeking there water to draw, when by the god she was seiz'd.Thus were the sons of Mars begotten! The twins did a she-wolf

ííííSuckle and nurture,--and Rome call'd herself queen of the world,-----ALEXANDER, and Caesar, and Henry, and Fred'rick, the mighty,

ííííOn me would gladly bestow half of the glory they earn'd,Could I but grant unto each one night on the couch where I'm lying;

ííííBut they, by Orcus's night, sternly, alas! are held down.Therefore rejoice, oh thou living one, blest in thy love-lighted homestead,

ííííEre the dark Lethe's sad wave wetteth thy fugitive foot.-----THESE few leaves, oh ye Graces, a bard presents, in your honour,

ííííOn your altar so pure, adding sweet rosebuds as well,And he does it with hope. The artist is glad in his workshop,

ííííWhen a Pantheon it seems round him for ever to bring.Jupiter knits his godlike brow,--her's, Juno up-lifteth;

ííííPhoebus strides on before, shaking his curly-lock'd headCalmly and drily Minerva looks down, and Hermes the light one,

ííííTurneth his glances aside, roguish and tender at once.But tow'rds Bacchus, the yielding, the dreaming, raiseth Cythere

ííííLooks both longing and sweet, e'en in the marble yet moist.Of his embraces she thinks with delight, and seems to be asking

íííí""Should not our glorious son take up his place by our side?""-----AMOR is ever a rogue, and all who believe him are cheated!

ííííTo me the hypocrite came: ""Trust me, I pray thee, this once.Honest is now my intent,--with grateful thanks I acknowledge

ííííThat thou thy life and thy works hast to my worship ordain'd.See, I have follow'd thee thither, to Rome, with kindly intention,

ííííHoping to give thee mine aid, e'en in the foreigner's land.Every trav'ller complains that the quarters he meets with are wretched

ííííHappily lodged, though, is he, who is by Amor receiv'd.Thou dost observe the ruins of ancient buildings with wonder,

ííííThoughtfully wandering on, over each time-hallow'd spot.Thou dost honour still more the worthy relics created

ííííBy the few artists--whom I loved in their studios to seek.I 'twas fashion'd those forms! thy pardon,--I boast not at present;

ííííPresently thou shalt confess, that what I tell thee is true.Now that thou serv'st me more idly, where are the beauteous figures,

ííííWhere are the colours, the light, which thy creations once fill'd?Hast thou a mind again to form? The school of the Grecians

ííííStill remains open, my friend; years have not barr'd up its doors.I, the teacher, am ever young, and love all the youthful,

ííííLove not the subtle and old; Mother, observe what I say!Still was new the Antique, when yonder blest ones were living;

ííííHappily live,--and, in thee, ages long vanish'd will live!Food for song, where hop'st thou to find it? I only can give it,

ííííAnd a more excellent style, love, and love only can teach.""Thus did the Sophist discourse. What mortal, alas! could resist him?

ííííAnd when a master commands, I have been train'd to obey.Now he deceitfully keeps his word, gives food for my numbers,

ííííBut, while he does so, alas! robs me of time, strength, and mind.Looks, and pressure of hands, and words of kindness, and kisses,

ííííSyllables teeming with thought, by a fond pair are exchang'd.Then becomes whispering, talk,--and stamm'ring, a language enchanting;

ííííFree from all prosody's rules, dies such a hymn on the ear.Thee, Aurora, I used to own as the friend of the Muses;

ííííHath, then, Amor the rogue cheated, Aurora, e'en thee?Thou dost appear to me now as his friend, and again dost awake me

ííííUnto a day of delight, while at his altar I kneel.All her locks I find on my bosom, her head is reposing,

ííííPressing with softness the arm, which round her neck is entwin'd;Oh! what a joyous awak'ning, ye hours so peaceful, succeeded,

ííííMonument sweet of the bliss which had first rock'd us to sleepIn her slumber she moves, and sinks, while her face is averted,

ííííFar on the breadth of the couch, leaving her hand still in mineHeartfelt love unites us for ever, and yearnings unsullied,

ííííAnd our cravings alone claim for themselves the exchange.One faint touch of the hand, and her eyes so heavenly see I

ííííOnce more open. Ah, no! let me still look on that form!Closed still remain! Ye make me confused and drunken, ye rob me

ííííFar too soon of the bliss pure contemplation affords.Mighty, indeed, are these figures! these limbs, how gracefully rounded!

ííííTheseus, could'st thou e'er fly, whilst Ariadne thus slept?Only one single kiss on these lips! Oh, Theseus, now leave us!

ííííGaze on her eyes! she awakes--Firmly she holds thee embrac'd-----PART II.

ííííALEXIS AND DORA.

íííí[This beautiful poem was first published in Schiller's Horen.]

ííííFARTHER and farther away, alas! at each moment the vessel

ííííHastens, as onward it glides, cleaving the foam-cover'd flood!Long is the track plough'd up by the keel where dolphins are sporting,

ííííFollowing fast in its rear, while it seems flying pursuit.All forebodes a prosperous voyage; the sailor with calmness

ííííLeans 'gainst the sail, which alone all that is needed performs.Forward presses the heart of each seamen, like colours and streamers;

ííííBackward one only is seen, mournfully fix'd near the mast,While on the blue tinged mountains, which fast are receding, he gazeth,

ííííAnd as they sink in the sea, joy from his bosom departs.Vanish'd from thee, too, oh Dora, is now the vessel that robs thee

ííííOf thine Alexis, thy friend,--ah, thy betrothed as well!Thou, too, art after me gazing in vain. Our hearts are still throbbing,

ííííThough, for each other, yet ah! 'gainst one another no more.Oh, thou single moment, wherein I found life! thou outweighest

ííííEvery day which had else coldly from memory fled.'Twas in that moment alone, the last, that upon me descended

ííííLife, such as deities grant, though thou perceived'st it not.Phoebus, in vain with thy rays dost thou clothe the ether in glory:

ííííThine all-brightening day hateful alone is to me.Into myself I retreat for shelter, and there, in the silence,

ííííStrive to recover the time when she appear'd with each day.Was it possible beauty like this to see, and not feel it?

ííííWork'd not those heavenly charms e'en on a mind dull as thine?Blame not thyself, unhappy one! Oft doth the bard an enigma

ííííThus propose to the throng, skillfully hidden in words.Each one enjoys the strange commingling of images graceful,

ííííYet still is wanting the word which will discover the sense.When at length it is found, the heart of each hearer is gladden'd,

ííííAnd in the poem he sees meaning of twofold delight.Wherefore so late didst thou remove the bandage, oh Amor,

ííííWhich thou hadst placed o'er mine eyes,--wherefore remove it so late?Long did the vessel, when laden, lie waiting for favouring breezes,

íííí'Till in kindness the wind blew from the land o'er the sea.Vacant times of youth! and vacant dreams of the future!

ííííYe all vanish, and nought, saving the moment, remains.Yes! it remains,--my joy still remains! I hold thee; my Dora,

ííííAnd thine image alone, Dora, by hope is disclos'd.Oft have I seen thee go, with modesty clad, to the temple,

ííííWhile thy mother so dear solemnly went by thy side.Eager  and nimble thou wert, in bearing thy fruit to the market,

ííííBoldly the pail from the well didst thou sustain on thy head.Then was reveal'd thy neck, then seen thy shoulders so beauteous,

ííííThen, before all things, the grace filling thy motions was seen.Oft have I fear'd that the pitcher perchance was in danger of falling,

ííííYet it ever remain'd firm on the circular cloth.Thus, fair neighbour, yes, thus I oft was wont to observe thee,

ííííAs on the stars I might gaze, as I might gaze on the moon,Glad indeed at the sight, yet feeling within my calm bosom

ííííNot the remotest desire ever to call them mine own.Years thus fleeted away! Although our houses were only

ííííTwenty paces apart, yet I thy threshold ne'er cross'd.Now by the fearful flood are we parted! Thou liest to Heaven,

ííííBillow! thy beautiful blue seems to me dark as the night.All were now in movement; a boy to the house of my father

ííííRan at full speed and exclaim'd: ""Hasten thee quick to the strandHoisted the sail is already, e'en now in the wind it is flutt'ring,

ííííWhile the anchor they weigh, heaving it up from the sand;Come, Alexis, oh come!""--My worthy stout-hearted father

ííííPress'd, with a blessing, his hand down on my curly-lock'd head,While my mother carefully reach'd me a newly-made bundle,

íííí""Happy mayst thou return!"" cried they--"" both happy and rich!""Then I sprang away, and under my arm held the bundle,

ííííRunning along by the wall. Standing I found thee hard by,At the door of thy garden. Thou smilingly saidst then ""Alexis!

ííííSay, are yon boisterous crew going thy comrades to be?Foreign coasts will thou visit, and precious merchandise purchase,

ííííOrnaments meet for the rich matrons who dwell in the town.Bring me, also, I praythee, a light chain; gladly I'll pay thee,

ííííOft have I wish'd to possess some stich a trinket as that.""There I remain'd, and ask'd, as merchants are wont, with precision

ííííAfter the form and the weight which thy commission should have.Modest, indeed, was the price thou didst name! I meanwhile was gazing

ííííOn thy neck which deserv'd ornaments worn but by queens.Loudly now rose the cry from the ship; then kindly thou spakest

íííí""Take, I entreat thee, some fruit out of the garden, my friendTake the ripest oranges, figs of the whitest; the ocean

ííííBeareth no fruit, and, in truth, 'tis not produced by each land.""So I entered in. Thou pluckedst the fruit from the branches,

ííííAnd the burden of gold was in thine apron upheld.Oft did I cry, Enough! But fairer fruits were still falling

ííííInto the hand as I spake, ever obeying thy touch.Presently didst thou reached the arbour; there lay there a basket,

ííííSweet blooming myrtle trees wav'd, as we drew nigh, o'er our heads.Then thou began'st to arrange the fruit with skill and in silence:

ííííFirst the orange, which lay heavy as though 'twere of gold,Then the yielding fig, by the slightest pressure disfigur'd,

ííííAnd with myrtle the gift soon was both cover'd and grac'd.But I raised it not up. I stood. Our eyes met together,

ííííAnd my eyesight grew dim, seeming obscured by a film,Soon I felt thy bosom on mine! Mine arm was soon twining

ííííRound thy beautiful form; thousand times kiss'd I thy neck.On my shoulder sank thy head; thy fair arms, encircling,

ííííSoon rendered perfect the ring knitting the rapturous pair.Amor's hands I felt: he press'd us together with ardour,

ííííAnd, from the firmament clear, thrice did it thunder; then tearsStream'd from mine eyes in torrents, thou weptest, I wept, both were weeping,

ííííAnd, 'mid our sorrow and bliss, even the world seem'd to die.Louder and louder they calI'd from the strand; my feet would no longer

ííííBear my weight, and I cried:--""Dora! and art thou not mine?""""Thine forever!"" thou gently didst say. Then the tears we were shedding

ííííSeem'd to be wiped from our eyes, as by the breath of a god.Nearer was heard the cry ""Alexis!"" The stripling who sought me

ííííSuddenly peep'd through the door. How he the basket snatch'd up!How he urged me away! how press'd I thy hand! Wouldst thou ask me

ííííHow the vessel I reach'd? Drunken I seem'd, well I know.Drunken my shipmates believed me, and so had pity upon me;

ííííAnd as the breeze drove us on, distance the town soon obscur'd.""Thine for ever!"" thou, Dora, didst murmur; it fell on my senses

ííííWith the thunder of Zeus! while by the thunderer's throneStood his daughter, the Goddess of Love; the Graces were standing

ííííClose by her side! so the bond beareth an impress divine!Oh then hasten, thou ship, with every favouring zephyr!

ííííOnward, thou powerful keel, cleaving the waves as they foam!Bring me unto the foreign harbour, so that the goldsmith

ííííMay in his workshop prepare straightway the heavenly pledge!Ay, of a truth, the chain shall indeed be a chain, oh my Dora!

ííííNine times encircling thy neck, loosely around it entwin'dOther and manifold trinkets I'll buy thee; gold-mounted bracelets,

ííííRichly and skillfully wrought, also shall grace thy fair hand.There shall the ruby and emerald vie, the sapphire so lovely

ííííBe to the jacinth oppos'd, seeming its foil; while the goldHolds all the jewels together, in beauteous union commingled.

ííííOh, how the bridegroom exults, when he adorns his betroth'd!Pearls if I see, of thee they remind me; each ring that is shown me

ííííBrings to my mind thy fair hand's graceful and tapering form.I will barter and buy; the fairest of all shalt thou choose thee,

ííííJoyously would I devote all of the cargo to thee.Yet not trinkets and jewels alone is thy loved one procuring;

ííííWith them he brings thee whate'er gives to a housewife delight.Fine and woollen coverlets, wrought with an edging of purple,

ííííFit for a couch where we both, lovingly, gently may rest;Costly pieces of linen. Thou sittest and sewest, and clothest

ííííMe, and thyself, and, perchance, even a third with it too.Visions of hope, deceive ye my heart! Ye kindly Immortals,

ííííSoften this fierce-raging flame, wildly pervading my breast!Yet how I long to feel them again, those rapturous torments.

ííííWhen, in their stead, care draws nigh, coldly and fearfully calm.Neither the Furies' torch, nor the hounds of hell with their harking

ííííAwe the delinquent so much, down in the plains of despair,As by the motionless spectre I'm awed, that shows me the fair one

ííííFar away: of a truth, open the garden-door stands!And another one cometh! For him the fruit, too, is falling,

ííííAnd for him, also, the fig strengthening honey doth yield!Doth she entice him as well to the arbour? He follows? Oh, make me

ííííBlind, ye Immortals! efface visions like this from my mind!Yes, she is but a maiden! And she who to one doth so quickly

ííííYield, to another ere long, doubtless, Will turn herself round.Smile not, Zeus, for this once, at an oath so cruelly broken!

ííííThunder more fearfully! Strike!--Stay--thy fierce lightnings withhold!Hurl at me thy quivering bolt! In the darkness of midnight

ííííStrike with thy lightning this mast, make it a pitiful wreck!Scatter the planks all around, and give to the boisterous billows

ííííAll these wares, and let me be to the dolphins a preyNow, ye Muses, enough! In vain would ye strive to depicture

ííííHow, in a love-laden breast, anguish alternates with bliss.Ye cannot heal the wounds, it is true, that love hath inflicted;

ííííYet from you only proceeds, kindly ones, comfort and balm.

ííííIN NINE CANTOS.-----I. KALLIOPE.

ííííFATE AND SYMPATHY.

íííí""NE'ER have I seen the market and streets so thoroughly empty!Still as the grave is the town, clear'd out! I verily fancyFifty at most of all our inhabitants still may be found there.People are so inquisitive! All are running and racingMerely to see the sad train of poor fellows driven to exile.Down to the causeway now building, the distance nearly a league is,And they thitherward rush, in the heat and the dust of the noonday.As for me, I had rather not stir from my place just to stare atWorthy and sorrowful fugitives, who, with what goods they can carry,Leaving their own fair land on the further side of the Rhine-stream,Over to us are crossing, and wander through the delightfulNooks of this fruitful vale, with all its twistings and windings.Wife, you did right well to bid our son go and meet them,Taking with him old linen, and something to eat and to drink too,Just to give to the poor; the rich are bound to befriend them.How he is driving along! How well he holds in the horses!Then the new little carriage looks very handsome; inside itFour can easily sit, besides the one on the coachbox.This time he is alone; how easily-turns it the corner!""Thus to his wife the host of the Golden Lion discoursed,Sitting at ease in the porch of his house adjoining the market.Then replied as follows the shrewd and sensible hostess""Father, I don't like giving old linen away, for I find itUseful in so many ways, 'tis not to he purchased for moneyJust when it's wanted. And yet to-day I gladly have givenMany excellent articles, shirts and covers and suchlike;For I have heard of old people and children walking half-naked.Will you forgive me, too, for having ransacked your presses?That grand dressing-gown, cover'd with Indian flowers all over,Made of the finest calico, lined with excellent flannel,I have despatch'd with the rest; 'tis thin, old, quite out of fashion.""

ííííBut the worthy landlord only smiled, and then answer'dI shall dreadfully miss that ancient calico garment,Genuine Indian stuff! They're not to be had any longer.Well! I shall wear it no more. And your poor husband henceforwardAlways must wear a surtout, I suppose, or commonplace jacket,Always must put on his boots; good bye to cap and to slippers!""

íííí""See,"" continued his wife, ""a few are already returningWho have seen the procession, which long ago must have pass'd by.See how dusty their shoes are, and how their faces are glowingEach one carries a handkerchief, wiping the sweat from his forehead.I, for one, wouldn't hurry and worry myself in such weatherMerely to see such a sight! I'm certain to hear all about it.""

ííííAnd the worthy father, speaking with emphasis, added""Such fine weather seldom lasts through the whole of the harvestAnd we're bringing the fruit home, just as the hay we brought lately,Perfectly dry; the sky is clear, no cloud's in the heavens,And the whole day long delicious breezes are blowing.Splendid weather I call it! The corn already too ripe is,And to-morrow begin we to gather the plentiful harvest.""

ííííWhilst he was thus discoursing, the number of men and of womenCrossing the market and going towards home kept ever increasing;And there return'd amongst others, bringing with him his daughters,On the other side of the market, their prosperous neighbour,Going full speed to his newbuilt house, the principal merchant,Riding inside an open carriage (in Landau constructed).All the streets were alive; for the town, though small, was well peopled,Many a factory throve there, and many a business also.

ííííLong sat the excellent couple under the doorway, exchangingMany a passing remark on the people who happen'd to pass them.Presently thus to her husband exclaim'd the good-natured hostess""See! Yon comes the minister; with him is walking the druggist:They'll be able to give an account of all that has happen'd,What they witness'd, and many a sight I fear which was painful.""

ííííBoth of them came in a friendly manner, and greeted the couple,Taking their seats on the wooden benches under the doorway,Shaking the dust from their feet, their handkerchiefs using to fan them.Presently, after exchanging reciprocal greetings, the druggistOpen'd his mouth, and almost peevishly vented his feelings""What strange creatures men are! They all resemble each other,All take pleasure in staring, when troubles fall on their neighbours.Ev'ry one runs to see the flames destroying a dwelling,Or a poor criminal led in terror and shame to the scaffold.All the town has been out to gaze at the sorrowing exiles,None of them bearing in mind that a like misfortune hereafter,Possibly almost directly, may happen to be their own portion.I can't pardon such levity; yet 'tis the nature of all men.""Thereupon rejoin'd the noble and excellent pastor,He, the charm of the town, in age scarce more than a stripling:--(He was acquainted with life, and knew the wants of his hearers,Fully convinced of the worth of the Holy Scriptures, whose missionIs to reveal man's fate, his inclinations to fathom;He was also well read in the best of secular writings.)""I don't like to find fault with any innocent impulseWhich in the mind of man Dame Nature has ever implanted;For what reason and intellect ne'er could accomplish, is oftenDone by some fortunate, quite irresistible instinct within him.If mankind were never by curiosity driven,Say, could they e'er have found out for themselves the wonderful mannerThings in the world range in order? For first they Novelty look for,Then with untiring industry seek to discover the Useful,Lastly they yearn for the Good, which makes them noble and worthy.All through their youth frivolity serves as their joyous companion,Hiding the presence of danger, and. swiftly effacing the tracesCaused by misfortune and grief, as soon as their onslaught is over.Truly the man's to be praised who, as years roll onward, developsOut of such glad disposition an intellect settled and steady,--Who, in good fortune as well as misfortune, strives zealously, nobly;For what is Good he brings forth, replacing whatever is injured.""Then in a friendly voice impatiently spoke thus the hostess:--""Tell us what have you seen; I am eagerly longing to hear it.""

ííííThen with emphasis answer'd the druggist:--"" The terrible storiesTold me to-day will serve for a long time to make me unhappy.Words would fail to describe the manifold pictures of mis'ry.Far in the distance saw we the dust, before we descendedDown to the meadows; the rising hillocks hid the processionLong from our eyes, and little could we distinguish about it.When, however, we reach'd the road that winds thro' the valley,Great was the crowd and the noise of the emigrants mix'd with the waggons.We unhappily saw poor fellows passing in numbers,Some of them showing how bitter the sense of their sorrowful flight was,Some with a feeling of joy at saving their lives in a hurry.Sad was the sight of the manifold goods and chattels pertainingUnto a well-managed house, which the careful owner's accustom'dEach in its proper position to place, and in regular order,Always ready for use, for all are wanted and useful.--Sad was the sight of them now, on many a waggon and barrowHeap'd in thorough confusion, and hurriedly huddled together.Over a cupboard was placed a sieve and a coverlet woollen;Beds in the kneeding troughs lay, and linen over the glasses.Ah! and the danger appear'd to rob the men of their senses,Just as in our great fire of twenty years ago happen'd,When what was worthless they saved, and left all the best things behind them.So on the present occasion with heedless caution they carriedMany valueless chattels, o'erlading the cattle and horses,--Common old boards and barrels, a birdcage next to a goosepen.Women and children were gasping beneath the weight of their bundles,Baskets and tubs full of utterly useless articles, bearing.(Man is always unwilling the least of his goods to abandon.)Thus on its dusty way advanced the crowded procession,All in hopeless confusion. First one, whose cattle were weaker,Fain would slowly advance, while others would eagerly hasten.Then there arose a scream of half-crush'd women and children,And a lowing of cattle, with yelping of dogs intermingled,And a wailing of aged and sick, all sitting and shaking,Ranged in their beds on the top of the waggon too-heavily laden.Next some lumbering wheel, push'd out of the track by the pressure,Went to the edge of the roadway; the vehicle fell in the ditch then,Rolling right over, and throwing, in falling, the men who were in itFar in the field, screaming loudly, their persons however uninjured.Then the boxes roll'd off and tumbled close to the waggon.Those who saw them failing full surely expected to see themSmash'd to pieces beneath the weight of the chests and the presses.So the waggon lay broken, and those that it carried were helpless,For the rest of the train went on, and hurriedly pass'd them,Thinking only of self, and carried away by the current.So we sped to the spot, and found the sick and the agedWho, when at home and in bed, could scarcely endure their sad ailments,Lying there on the ground, all sighing and groaning in anguish,Stifled by clouds of dust, and scorch'd by the fierce sun of summer.

ííííThen replied in tones of compassion the sensitive landlordHermann I trust will find them and give them refreshment and clothing.I should unwillingly see them: I grieve at the eight of such sorrow.Touch'd by the earliest news of the sad extent of the suffering,Hastily sent we a trifle from out of our superabundance,Just to comfort a few, and then our minds were more easy.Now let us cease to discourse on such a sorrowful subject,For men's hearts are easily overshadow'd by terror,And by care, more odious far to me than misfortune.Now let us go to a cooler place, the little back-parlour;There the sun never shines, and the walls are so thick that the hot airNever can enter; and mother shall forthwith bring us a glass eachFull of fine Eighty-three, well fitted to drive away trouble.This is a bad place for drinking; the flies will hum round the glasses.""So they all went inside, enjoying themselves in the coolness.Then in a well-cut flask the mother carefully brought themSome of that clear good wine, upon a bright metal waiterWith those greenish rummers, the fittingest goblets for Rhine wine.So the three sat together, around the glistening polish'dCircular large brown table-─on massive feet it was planted.Merrily clink'd together the glasses of host and of pastor,But the other one thoughtfully held his glass without moving,And in friendly fashion the host thus ask'd him to join them:--

íííí""Drink, good neighbour, I pray! A merciful God has protectedUs in the past from misfortune, and will protect us in future.All must confess that since He thought fit to severely chastise us,When that terrible fire occurr'd, He has constantly bless'd us.And watch'd over us constantly, just as man is accustom'dHis eye's precious apple to guard, that dearest of members.Shall He not for the future preserve us, and be our Protector?For 'tis in danger we learn to appreciate duly His Goodness.This so flourishing town, which He built again from its ashesBy the industrious hands of its burghers, and bless'd it so richly,Will He again destroy it, and render their toil unavailing?""

ííííCheerfully answer'd the excellent pastor, in accents of mildness""Steadfastly cling to this faith, and cherish such worthy opinions;In good fortune they'll make you prudent, and then in misfortuneWell-grounded hopes they'll supply, and furnish you true consolation.""

ííííThen continued the host, with thoughts full of manhood and wisdom""Oft have I greeted with wonder the rolling flood of the Rhine stream,When, on my business trav'lling, I've once more come to its borders.Grand has it ever appear'd, exalting my feelings and senses;But I could never imagine that soon its beautiful marginInto a wall would be turn'd, to keep the French from our country,And its wide-spreading bed a ditch to hinder and check them.So by Nature we're guarded, we're guarded by valorous Germans,And by the Lord we're guarded; who then would foolishly tremble?Weary the combatants are, and all things indicate peace soon;And when at length the long-expected festival's holdenHere in our church, and the bells chime in with the organ in chorus,And the trumpets are blowing, the noble Te Deum upraising,Then on that selfsame day I fain would see, my good pastor,Our dear Hermann kneel with his bride at the altar before you,And the glad festival held through the length and breadth of the countryWill henceforward to me be a glad anniversary also!But I am grieved to observe that the youth, who is always so activeWhen he is here at home, abroad is so slow and so timid.Little at any time cares he to mix with the rest of the people;Yes, he even avoids young maidens' society ever,And the frolicsome dance, that great delight of young people.""

ííííThus he spake, and then listen'd. The sound of the stamping of horsesDrawing nearer was heard; and then the roll of the carriage,Which, with impetuous speed, now thunder'd under the gateway.-----II.  TERPSICHORE.

ííííHERMANN.

ííííTHEN when into the room the well-built son made his entry,Straightway with piercing glances the minister eyed him intently,And with carefulness watch'd his looks and the whole of his bearing,With an inquiring eye which easily faces decyphers;Then he smiled, and with cordial words address'd him as follows""How you are changed in appearance, my friend! I never have seen youHalf so lively before; your looks are thoroughly cheerful.You have return'd quite joyous and merry. You've doubtless dividedAll of the presents amongst the poor, their blessings receiving.""

ííííThen in calm accents replied the son, with gravity speaking""Whether I've laudably acted, I know not; I follow'd the impulseOf my own heart, as now I'll proceed to describe with exactness.Mother, you rummaged so long, in looking over old pieces,And in making your choice, that 'twas late when the bundle was ready,And the wine and the beer were slowly and carefully pack'd up.When I at length emerged at the gate, and came on the highway,Streams of citizens met I returning, with women and children,For the train of the exiles had long disappear'd in the distance.So I quicken'd my pace, and hastily drove to the villageWhere I had heard that to-night to rest and to sleep they intended.Well, as I went on my way, the newly-made causeway ascending,Suddenly saw I a waggon, of excellent timber constructed,Drawn by a couple of oxen, the best and the strongest of foreign.Close beside it there walk'd, with sturdy footsteps, a maiden,Guiding the two strong beasts with a long kind of staff, which with skill sheKnew how to use, now driving, and now restraining their progress.When the maiden observed me, she quietly came near the horses,And address'd me as follows:--'Our usual condition, believe me,Is not so sad as perchance you might judge from our present appearance.I am not yet accustom'd to ask for alms from a stranger,Who so often but gives, to rid himself of a beggar.But I'm compell'd to speak by necessity. Here on the straw nowLies the lately-confined poor wife of a wealthy landowner,Whom with much trouble I managed to save with oxen and waggon.We were late in arriving, and scarcely with life she escaped.Now the newly-born child in her arms is lying, all naked,And our friends will be able to give them but little assistance,E'en if in the next village, to which to-night we are going,We should still find them, although I fear they have left it already.If you belong to the neighbourhood, any available linenThese poor people will deem a most acceptable present.

íííí""Thus she spake, and wearily raised herself the pale patientUp from the straw and gazed upon me, while thus I made answer'Oft doth a heavenly spirit whisper to kind-hearted people,So that they feel the distress o'er their poorer brethren impending;For my mother, your troubles foreboding, gave me a bundleReady prepared for relieving the wants of those who were naked.'Then I loosen'd the knots of the cord, and the dressing-gown gave herWhich belong'd to my father, and gave her some shirts and some linen,And she thank'd me with joy and said:--'The fortunate know notHow 'tis that miracles happen; we only discover in sorrowGod's protecting finger and hand, extended to beckonGood men to good. May your kindness to us by Him be requited.'And I saw the poor patient joyfully handling the linen,Valuing most of all the soft flannel, the dressing-gown lining.Then the maid thus address'd her:--'Now let us haste to the villageWhere our friends are resting, to-night intending to sleep thereThere I will straightway attend to what e'er for the infant is needed.'Then she saluted me too, her thanks most heartily giving,Drove the oxen, the waggon went on. I lingerd behind them,Holding my horses rein'd back, divided between two opinions,Whether to hasten ahead, reach the village, the viands distribute'Mongst the rest of the people, or give them forthwith to the maiden,So that she might herself divide them amongst them with prudenceSoon I made up my mind, and follow'd after her softly,Overtook her without delay, and said to her quickly'Maiden, it was not linen alone that my mother providedAnd in the carriage placed, as clothing to give to the naked,But she added meat, and many an excellent drink too;And I have got quite a stock stow'd away in the boot of the carriage.Well, I have taken a fancy the rest of the gifts to depositIn your hands, and thus fulfil to the best my commission;You will divide them with prudence, whilst I my fate am obeying.'Then the maiden replied:--'With faithfulness I will distributeAll your gifts, and the needy shall surely rejoice at your bounty.'Thus she spake, and I hastily open'd the boot of the carriage,Took out the hams (full heavy they were) and took out the bread-stuffs,Flasks of wine and beer, and handed the whole of them over.Gladly would I have given her more, but empty the boot was.Straightway she pack'd them away at the feet of the patient, and forthwithStarted again, whilst I hasten'd back to the town with my horses.""

ííííThen when Hermann had ended his story, the garrulous neighbourOpen'd his mouth and exclaim'd:--""I only deem the man happyWho lives alone in his house in these days of flight and confusion,Who has neither wife nor children cringing beside himI feel happy at present; I hate the title of father;Care of children and wife in these days would be a sad drawback.Often have I bethought me of flight, and have gather'd togetherAll that I deem most precious, the antique gold and the jewelsWorn by my late dear mother, not one of which has been sold yet.Much indeed is left out, that is not so easily carried.Even the herbs and the roots, collected with plenty of trouble,I should he sorry to lose, though little in value they may be.If the dispenser remains, I shall leave my house in good spiritsIf my ready money is saved, and my body, why trulyAll is saved, for a bachelor easily flies when 'tis needed.""

íííí""Neighbour,"" rejoin'd forthwith young Hermann, with emphasis speaking""Altogether I differ, and greatly blame your opinions.Can that man be deem'd worthy, who both in good and ill fortuneThinks alone of himself, and knows not the secret of sharingSorrows and joys with others, and feels no longing to do so?I could more easily now than before determine to marryMany an excellent maiden needs a husband's protection,Many a man a cheerful wife, when sorrow's before him.""Smilingly said then the father:--""I'm pleas'd to hear what you're saying,Words of such wisdom have seldom been utter'd by you in my presence.

ííííThen his good mother broke in, in her turn, with vivacity speaking""Son, you are certainly right. We parents set the example.'Twas not in time of pleasure that we made choice of each other,And 'twas the saddest of hours, that knitted us closely together.Monday morning,--how well I remember! the very day afterThat most terrible fire occurr'd which burnt down the borough,Twenty years ago now; the day, like to-day, was a Sunday,Hot and dry was the weather, and little available water.All the inhabitants, clothed in their festival garments, were walking,Scatter'd about in the inns and the mills of the neighbouring hamlets.At one end of the town the fire broke out, and the flames ranHastily all through the streets, impell'd by the draught they created.And the barns were consumed, where all the rich harvest was gather'dAnd all the streets as far as the market; the dwelling house alsoOf my father hard by was destroy'd, as likewise was this one.Little indeed could we save; I sat the sorrowful night throughOn the green of the town, protecting the beds and the boxes.Finally sleep overtook me, and when by the cool breeze of morningWhich dies away when the sun arises I was awaken'd,Saw I the smoke and the glow, and the half-consumed walls and the chimneys.Then my heart was sorely afflicted; but soon in his gloryRose the sun more brilliant than ever, my spirits reviving.Then in haste I arose, impell'd the site to revisitWhere our dwelling had stood, to see if the chickens were livingWhich I especially loved; for childlike I still was by nature.But when over the ruins of courtyard and house I was climbing,Which still smoked, and saw my dwelling destroy'd and deserted,You came up on the other side, the ruins exploring.You had a horse shut up in his stall; the still-glowing raftersOver it lay, and rubbish, and nought could be seen of the creature.Over against each other we stood, in doubt and in sorrow,For the wall had fallen which used to sever our courtyards;And you grasp'd my hand, addressing me softly as follows'Lizzy, what here are you doing? Away! Your soles you are burning,For the rubbish is hot, and is scorching my boots which are thicker.'Then you lifted me up, and carried me off through your courtyard.There still stood the gateway before the house, with its arch'd roof,Just as it now is standing, the only thing left remaining.And you sat me down and kiss'd me, and I tried to stop you,But you presently said, with kindly words full of meaning'See, my house is destroy'd! Stop here and help me to build it,I in return will help to rebuild the house of your father.'I understood you not, till you sent to my father your mother,And ere long our marriage fulfilid the troth we soon plighted.Still to this day I remember with pleasure the half-consumed rafters,Still do I see the sun in all his majesty rising,For on that day I gain'd my husband; the son of my youth tooGained I during that earliest time of the wild desolation.Therefore commend I you, Hermann, for having with confidence guilelessTurn'd towards marriage your thoughts in such a period of mourning,And for daring to woo in war and over the ruins.--""

ííííThen the father straightway replied, with eagerness speaking:--""Sensible is your opinion, and true is also the storyWhich you have told us, good mother, for so did ev'rything happen.But what is better is better. 'Tis not the fortune of all menAll their life and existence to find decided beforehand;All are not doom'd to such troubles as we and others have suffer'd.O, how happy is he whose careful father and motherHave a house ready to give him, which he can successfully manage!All beginnings are hard, and most so the landlords profession.Numberless things a man must have, and ev'rything dailyDearer becomes, so he needs to scrape together more money.So I am hoping that you, dear Hermann, will shortly be bringingHome to us a bride possessing an excellent dowry,For a worthy husband deserves a girl who is wealthy,And 'tis a capital thing for the wish'd-for wife to bring with herPlenty of suitable articles stow'd in her baskets and boxes.Not in vain for years does the mother prepare for her daughterStocks of all kinds of linen, both finest and strongest in texture;Not in vain do god-parents give them presents of silver,Or the father lay by in his desk a few pieces of money.For she hereafter will gladden, with all her goods and possessions,That happy youth who is destined from out of all others to choose her.Yes! I know how pleasant it makes a house for a young wife,When she finds her own property placed in the rooms and the kitchen,And when she herself has cover'd the bed and the table.Only well-to-do brides should be seen in a house, I consider,For a poor one is sure at last to be scorn'd by her husband,And he'll deem her a jade who as jade first appear'd with her bundle.Men are always unjust, but moments of love are but transient.Yes, my Hermann, you greatly would cheer the old age of your fatherIf you soon would bring home a daughter-in-law to console me,Out of the neighbourhood too,--yes, out of yon dwelling, the green one!Rich is the man, in truth his trade and his manufacturesMake him daily richer, for when does a merchant not prosper?He has only three daughters; the whole of his wealth they'll inherit.True the eldest's already engaged; but then there's the second,And the third, who still (not for long) may be had for the asking.Had I been in your place, I should not till this time have waited;Bring home one of the girls, as I brought your mother before you.

ííííThen, with modesty, answer'd the son his impetuous father""Truly my wish was, like yours, to marry one of the daughtersOf our neighbour. We all, in fact, were brought up together,Sported in youthful days near the fountain adjoining the market,And from the rudeness of boys I often managed to save them.But those days have long pass'd the maidens grew up, and with reasonStop now at home and avoid the rougher pastimes of childhood.Well brought up with a vengeance they are! To please you, I sometimesWent to visit them, just for the sake of olden acquaintanceBut I was never much pleased at holding intercourse with them,For they were always finding fault, and I had to bear itFirst my coat was too long, the cloth too coarse, and the colourFar too common, my hair was cut and curl'd very badly.I at last was thinking of dressing myself like the shop-boys,Who are accustom'd on Sundays to show off their persons up yonder,And round whose coats in summer half-silken tatters are hanging.But ere long I discover'd they only intended to fool meThis was very annoying, my pride was offended, but more stillFelt I deeply wounded that they so mistook the good feelingsWhich I cherish'd towards them, especially Minnie, the youngest.Well, I went last Easter, politely to pay them a visit,And I wore the new coat now hanging up in the closet,And was frizzled and curld, like all the rest of the youngsters.When I enter'd, they titter'd; but that didn't very much matter.Minnie sat at the piano, the father was present amongst them,Pleased with his daughter's singing, and quite in a jocular humour.Little could I understand of the words in the song she was singing,But I constantly heard of Pamina, and then of Tamino,*

íííí(* Characters In Mozart's Zauberflote.)And I fain would express my opinion; so when she had ended,I ask'd questions respecting the text, and who were the persons.All were silent and smiled; but presently answer'd the father'Did you e'er happen, my friend, to hear of Eve or of Adam?'Then no longer restrain'd they themselves, the girls burst out laughing,All the boys laugh'd loudly, the old man's sides appear'd splitting.In my confusion I let my hat fall down, and the titt'ringLasted all the time the singing and playing continued.Then I hasten'd home, ashamed and full of vexation,Hung up my coat in the closet, and put my hair in disorderWith my fingers, and swore ne'er again to cross o'er their threshold.And I'm sure I was right; for they are all vain and unloving.And I hear they're so rude as to give me the nickname Tamino.""Then the mother rejoin'd:--""You're wrong, dear Hermann, to harbourAngry feelings against the children, for they are but children.Minnie's an excellent girl, and has a tenderness for you;Lately she ask'd how you were. Indeed, I wish you would choose her!""

ííííThen the son thoughtfully answer'd:--""I know not why, but the fact isMy annoyance has graven itself in my mind, and hereafterI could not bear at the piano to see her, or list to her singing.""

ííííBut the father sprang up, and said, in words full of anger""Little comfort you give me, in truth! I always have said it,When you took pleasure in horses, and cared for nothing but fieldwork;That which the servants of prosperous people perform as their duty,You yourself do; meanwhile the father his son must dispense with,Who in his honour was wont to court the rest of the townsfolk.Thus with empty hopes your mother early deceived me,When your reading, and writing, and learning at school ne'er succeededLike the rest of the boys, and so you were always the lowest.This all comes from a youth not possessing a due sense of honour,And not having the spirit to try and raise his position.Had my father but cared for me, as I have for you, sir,Sent me to school betimes, and given me proper instructors,I should not merely have been the host of the famed Golden Lion.""

ííííBut the son arose, and approach'd the doorway in silence,Slowly, and making no noise: but then the father in dudgeonAfter him shouted:--""Be off! I know you're an obstinate fellow!Go and look after the business; else I shall scold you severely;But don't fancy I'll ever allow you to bring home in triumphAs my daughter-in-law any boorish impudent hussy.Long have I lived in the world, and know how to manage most people,Know how to entertain ladies and gentlemen, so that they leave meIn good humour, and know how to flatter a stranger discreetly.But my daughter-in-law must have useful qualities also,And be able to soften my manifold cares and vexations.She must also play on the piano, that all the best peopleHere in the town may take pleasure in often coming to see us,As in the house of our neighbour the merchant happens each Sunday.""Softly the son at these words raised the latch, and left the apartment.-----III. THALIA.

ííííTHE BURGHERS.

ííííTHUS did the prudent son escape from the hot conversation,But the father continued precisely as he had begun itWhat is not in a man can never come out of him, surely!Never, I fear, shall I see fulfill'd my dearest of wishes,That my son should be unlike his father, but better.What would be the fate of a house or a town, if its inmatesDid not all take pride in preserving, renewing, improving,As we are taught by the age, and by the wisdom of strangers?Man is not born to spring out of the ground, just like a mere mushroom,And to rot away soon in the very place that produced him!Leaving behind him no trace of what he has done in his lifetime.One can judge by the look of a house of the taste of its master,As on ent'ring a town, one can judge the authorities' fitness.For where the towers and walls are falling, where in the ditchesDirt is collected, and dirt in every street is seen lying,Where the stones come out of their groove, and are not replaced there,Where the beams are rotting, and vainly the houses are waitingNew supports; that town is sure to be wretchedly managed.For where order and cleanliness reign not supreme in high places,Then to dirt and delay the citizens soon get accustom'd,Just as the beggar's accustom'd to wear his cloths full of tatters.Therefore I often have wish'd that Hermann would start on his travelsEre he's much older, and visit at any rate Strasburg and Frankfort,And that pleasant town, Mannheim, so evenly built and so cheerful.He who has seen such large and cleanly cities rests neverTill his own native town, however small, he sees better'd.Do not all strangers who visit us praise our well-mended gateways,And the well-whited tower, the church so neatly repair'd too?Do not all praise our pavements? Our well-arranged cover'd-in conduits,Always well furnish'd with water, utility blending with safety,So that a fire, whenever it happens, is straightway extinguish'd,--Is not this the result of that conflagration so dreadful?Six times in Council I superintended the town's works, receivingHearty thanks and assistance from every well-disposed burgher.How I design'd, follow'd up, and ensured the completion of measuresWorthy men had projected, and afterwards left all unfinish'd!Finally, every man in the Council took pleasure in working.All put forth their exertions, and now they have finally settledThat new highway to make, which will join our town with the main road.But I am greatly afraid that the young generation won't act thus;Some on the one hand think only of pleasure and trumpery dresses,Others wont stir out of doors, and pass all their time by the fireside,And our Hermann, I fear, will always be one of this last sort.""

ííííForthwith to him replied the excellent sensible mother""Father, you're always unjust whenever you speak of your son, andThat is the least likely way to obtain your wishes' fulfillment,For we cannot fashion our children after our fancy.We must have them and love them, as God has given them to us,Bring them up for the best, and let each do as he listeth.One has one kind of gift, another possesses another,Each one employs them, and each in turn in his separate fashionGood and happy becomes. My Hermann shall not be upbraided,For I know that he well deserves the wealth he'll inherit;He'll be an excellent landlord, a pattern to burghers and peasants,And, as I clearly foresee, by no means the last in the Council.But with your blame and reproaches, you daily dishearten him sadly,As you have done just now, and make the poor fellow unhappy.""

ííííThen she left the apartment, and after her son hasten'd quickly,Hoping somewhere to find him, and with her words of affectionGladden his heart, for he, the excellent son, well deserved it.Smilingly, when she had closed the door, continued the father""What a wonderful race of people are women and children.All of them fain would do whatever pleases their fancy,And we're only alow'd to praise them and flatter them freely.Once for all there's truth in the ancient proverb which tells us:He who moves not forward, goes backward! a capital saying!""

ííííSpeaking with much circumspection, the druggist made answer as follows""What you say, good neighbour, is certainly true, and my plan isAlways to think of improvement, provided tho' new, 'tis not costly.But what avails it in truth, unless one has plenty of money,Active and fussy to he, improving both inside and outside?Sadly confined are the means of a burgher; e'en when he knows it,Little that's good he is able to do, his purse is too narrow,And the sum wanted too great; and so he is always prevented.I have had plenty of schemes! but then I was terribly frighten'dAt the expense, especially during a time of such danger.Long had my house smiled upon me, decked out in modish exterior,Long had my windows with large panes of glass resplendently glitterd.Who can compete with a merchant, however, who, rolling in riches,Also knows the manner in which what is best can be purchased?Only look at the house up yonder, the new one: how handsomeLooks the stucco of those white scrolls on the green-colour'd panels!Large are the plates of the windows--how shining and brilliant the panes are,Quite eclipsing the rest of the houses that stand in the market!Yet at the time of the fire, our two were by far the most handsome,Mine at the sign of the Angel, and yours at the old Golden Lion.Then my garden was famous throughout the whole country, and strangersUsed to stop as they pass'd and peep through my red-colourd palingsAt my beggars of stone, and at my dwarfs, which were painted,He to whom I gave coffee inside my beautiful grotto,Which, alas! is now cover'd with dust and tumbling to pieces,Used to rejoice in the colour'd glimmering light of the mussels,Ranged in natural order around it, and connoisseurs evenUsed with dazzled eyes to gaze at the spars and the coral.Then, in the drawing-room, people look'd with delight on the painting,Where the prim ladies and gentlemen walked in the garden demurely,And with pointed fingers presented the flowers, and held them.Ah, if only such things were now to be seen! Little care INow to go out; for everything needs to be alter'd and tasteful,As it is call'd; and white are the benches of wood and the palings;All things are simple and plain; and neither carving not gildingNow are employ'd, and foreign timber is now all the fashion.I should be only too pleased to possess some novelty also,So as to march with the times, and my household furniture alter.But we all are afraid to make the least alteration,For who is able to pay the present charges of workmen?Lately a fancy possess'd me, the angel Michael, whose figureHangs up over my shop, to treat to a new coat of gilding,And the terrible Dragon, who round his feet is entwining;But I have left him all brown; as he is; for the cost quite alarm'd me.""-----IV.

ííííTHUS the men discoursed together; and meanwhile the motherWent in search of her son,--at first in front of the dwellingOn the bench of stone, for he was accustom'd to sit there.When she found him not there, she went to look in the stable,Thinking perchance he was feeding his splendid horses, the stallionsWhich he had bought when foals, and which he entrusted to no one.But the servant inform'd her that he had gone to the garden.Then she nimbly strode across the long double courtyard,Left the stables behind, and the barns all made of good timber,Enter'd the garden which stretch'd far away to the walls of the borough,Walk'd across it, rejoicing to see how all things were growing,Carefully straighten'd the props, on which the apple-tree's branches,Heavily loaded, reposed, and the weighty boughs of the pear-tree,Took a few caterpillars from off the strong-sprouting cabbage;For a bustling woman is never idle one moment.In this manner she came to the end of the long-reaching garden,Where was the arbour all cover'd with woodbine: she found not her son there,Nor was he to be seen in any part of the garden.But she found on the latch the door which out of the arbourThrough the wall of the town had been made by special permissionDuring their ancestor's time, the worthy old burgomaster.So she easily stepp'd across the dry ditch at the spot whereOn the highway abutted their well-inclosed excellent vineyard.Rising steeply upwards, its face tow'rd the sun turn'd directly.Up the hill she proceeded, rejoicing, as farther she mounted,At the size of the grapes, which scarcely were hid by the foliage.Shady and well-cover'd in, the middle walk at the top was,Which was ascended by steps of rough flat pieces constructed.And within it were hanging fine chasselas and muscatels also,And a reddish-blue grape, of quite an exceptional bigness,All with carefulness planted, to give to their guests after dinner.But with separate stems the rest of the vineyard was planted,Smaller grapes producing, from which the finest wine made is.So she constantly mounted, enjoying in prospect the autumn.And the festal day, when the neighbourhood met with rejoicing,Picking and treading the grapes, and putting the must in the wine-vats,Every corner and nook resounding at night with the fireworks,Blazing and cracking away, due honour to pay to the harvest.But she uneasy became, when she in vain had been callingTwice and three times her son, and when the sole answer that reach'd herCame from the garrulous echo which out of the town towers issued.Strange it appear'd to have to seek him; he never went far off,(As he before had told her) in order to ward off all sorrowFrom his dear mother, and her forebodings of coming disaster.But she still was expecting upon the highway to find him,For the doors at the bottom, like those at the top, of the vineyardStood wide open; and so at length she enter'd the broad fieldWhich, with its spreading expanse, o'er the whole of the hill's back extended.On their own property still she proceeded, greatly rejoicingAt their own crops, and at the corn which nodded so bravely,Over the whole field in golden majesty waving.Then on the border between the fields she follow'd the footpath,Keeping her eye on the pear-tree fix'd, the big one, which standingPerch'd by itself on the top of the hill, their property bounded.Who had planted it, no one knew; throughout the whole countryFar and wide was it visible; noted also its fruit was.Under its shadow the reaper ate his dinner at noonday,And the herdsman was wont to lie, when tending his cattle.Benches made of rough stones and of turf were placed all about it.And she was not mistaken; there sat her Hermann and restedOn his arm he was leaning, and seem'd to be looking cross countryTow'rds the mountains beyond; his back was turn'd to his mother.Softly creeping up, she lightly tapp'd on his shoulder;And he hastily turn'd; she saw that his eyes full of tears were.

íííí""Mother,"" he said in confusion:--""You greatly surprise me!"" and quicklyWiped he away his tears, the noble and sensitive youngster.""What! You are weeping, my son?"" the startled mother continued""That is indeed unlike you! I never before saw you crying!Say, what has sadden'd your heart? What drives you to sit here all lonelyUnder the shade of the pear-tree? What is it that makes you unhappy?""

ííííThen the excellent youth collected himself, and made answer""Truly that man can have no heart, but a bosom of iron,Who no sympathy feels for the wants of unfortunate exiles;He has no sense in his head who, in times of such deep tribulation,Has no concern for himself or for his country's well-being.What I to-day have seen and heard, has stirr'd up my feelings;Well, I have come up here, and seen the beautiful, spreadingLandscape, which in fruitful hills to our sight is presented,Seen the golden fruit of the sheaves all nodding together,And a plentiful crop of fruit, full garners foreboding.But, alas, how near is the foe! By the Rhine's flowing watersWe are protected indeed; but what are rivers and mountainsTo such a terrible nation, which hurries along like a tempest!For they summon together the young and the old from all quarters,Rushing wildly along, while the multitude little is caringEven for death; when one falls, his place is straight fill'd by another,Ah! and can Germans dare to remain at home in their dwellings,Thinking perchance to escape from the widely-threat'ning disaster?Dearest mother, I tell you that I to-day am quite sorryThat I was lately excused, when they selected the fightersOut of the townfolk. 'Tis true I'm an only son, and more-overLarge is our inn, and our business also is very important;Were it not better however for me to fight in the vanguardOn the frontier, than here to await disaster and bondage?Yes, my spirit has told me, and in my innermost bosomFeel I courage and longing to live and die for my country,And to others to set an example worthy to follow.Oh, of a truth, if the strength of the German youths was collectedOn the frontier, all bound by a vow not to yield to the stranger,He on our noble soil should never set foot, or be ableUnder our eyes to consume the fruits of the land, or to issueOrders unto our men, or despoil our women and maidens!See, good mother, within my inmost heart I've determinedSoon and straightway to do what seems to me right and becoming;For the man who thinks long, not always chooses what best is.See, I will not return to the house, but will go from here straightwayInto the town, and there will place at the fighters' disposalThis stout arm and this heart, to serve, as I best can, my country.Then let my father say whether feelings of honour are stirringIn my bosom or not, and whether I yearn to mount upwards.""

ííííThen with significance answer'd his good and sensible mother,Shedding tears in silence, which easily rose in her eyelids:--""Son, what has wrought so strange a change in your temper and feelings,That you freely and openly speak to your mother no longer,As you till yesterday did, nor tell her truly your wishes?If another had heard you speaking, he doubtless would praise youHighly, and deem your new resolution as worthy of honour,Being deceived by your words, and by your manner of speaking.I however can only blame you. I know you much better.You are concealing your heart, and very diff'rent your thoughts are;For I am sure you care not at all for drum and for trumpet,Nor, to please the maidens, care you to wear regimentals.For, though brave you may be, and gallant, your proper vocationIs to remain at home, the property quietly watching.Therefore tell me truly: What means this sudden decision?""

ííííEarnestly answer'd the son:--""You are wrong, dear-mother, one day isUnlike another. The youth soon ripens into his manhood.Ofttimes he ripens better to action in silence than livingThat tumultuous noisy life which ruins so many.And though silent I have been, and am, a heart has been fashion'dInside my bosom, which hates whatever unfair and unjust is,And I am able right well to discriminate secular matters.Work moreover my arms and my feet has mightily strengthen'd.All that I tell you is true; I boldly venture to say so.And yet, mother, you blame me with reason; you've caught me employingWords that are only half true, and that serve to conceal my true feelings.For I must need confess, it is not the advent of dangerCalls me away from my father's house, nor a resolute purposeUseful to be to my country, and dreaded to be by the foeman.Words alone it was that I utter'd,--words only intendedThose deep feelings to hide, which within my breast are contending.And now leave me, my mother! For as in my bosom I cherishWishes that are but vain, my life will be to no purpose.For I know that the Unit who makes a self-sacrifice, onlyInjures himself, unless all endeavour the Whole to accomplish.""

íííí""Now continue,"" replied forthwith his sensible mother:--""Tell me all that has happen'd, the least as w'ell as the greatestMen are always hasty, and only remember the last thing,And the hasty are easily forced from the road by obstructions.But a woman is skillful, and full of resources, and scorns notBye-roads to traverse when needed, well-skill'd to accomplish her purpose.Tell me then all, and why you are stirr'd by such violent feelingsMore than I ever have seen, while the blood is boiling within you,And from your eyes the tears against your will fain would fall now.""

ííííThen the youth gave way to his sorrow, and burst into weeping,Weeping aloud on the breast of his mother, and softly replying""Truly, my father's words to-day have wounded me sadly,Never have I deserved at his hands such treatment,--no, never!For to honour my parents was always my wish from my childhood,No one ever appear'd so prudent and wise as my parents,Who in the darker days of childhood carefully watch'd me.Much indeed it has been my lot to endure from my playmates,When with their knavish pranks they used to embitter my temper.Often I little suspected the tricks they were playing upon me:But if they happen'd to ridicule Father, whenever on SundaysOut of church he came with his slow deliberate footsteps,If they laugh'd at the strings of his cap, and his dressing-gown's flowers,Which he in stately wise wore, and to-day at length has discarded,Then in a fury I clench'd my fist, and, storming and raging,Fell upon them and hit and struck with terrible onslaught,Heedless where my blows fell. With bleeding noses they halloed,And could scarcely escape from the force of my blows and my kicking.Then, as in years I advanced, I had much to endure from my father,Who, in default of others to blame, would often abuse me,When at the Council's last sitting his anger perchance was excited,And I the penalty paid of the squabbles and strife of his colleagues.You yourself have oft pitied me; I endured it with patience,Always rememb'ring the much-to-be-honour'd kindness of parents,Whose only thought is to swell for our sakes their goods and possessions,And who deprive themselves of much, to save for their children.But, alas, not saving alone, for enjoyment hereafter,Constitutes happiness, no, not heaps of gold or of silver,Neither field upon field, however compact the estate be.For the father grows old, and his son at the same time grows older,Feeling no joy in To-day, and full of care for To-morrow.Now look down from this height, and see how beauteous before usLies the fair rich expanse, with vineyard and gardens at bottom;There are the stables and barns, and the rest of the property likewise;There I also descry the back of our house, in the gablesOf the roof may be seen the window of my small apartment.When I remember the time when I used to look out for the moon thereHalf through the night, or perchance at morning awaited the sunrise,When with but few hours of healthy sleep I was fully contented,Ah, how lonely do all things appear! My chamber, the court, andGarden, the beautiful field which spreads itself over the hillside;All appears but a desert to me: I still am unmarried!""Then his good mother answer'd his speech in a sensible manner""Son, your wish to be able to lead your bride to her chamber,Turning the night to the dearest and happiest half of your lifetime,Making your work by day more truly free and unfetter'd,Cannot be greater than that of your father and mother. We alwaysUrged you,--commanded, I even might say,--to choose some fair maiden.But I know full well, and my heart has told me alreadyIf the right hour arrives not, or if the right maiden appears notInstantly when they are sought for, man's choice is thrown in confusion,And he is driven by fear to seize what is counterfeit only.If I may tell you, my son, your choice already is taken,For your heart is smitten, and sensitive more than is usual.Answer me plainly, then, for my spirit already has told me:She whom now you have chosen is that poor emigrant maiden!""

íííí""Yes, dear mother, you're right!"" the son with vivacity answer'dYes, it is she! And unless this very day I conduct herHome as my bride, she will go on her way and escape me for ever,In the confusion of war, and in moving backwards and forwards.Mother, then before my eyes will in vain he unfoldedAll our rich estate, and each year henceforward be fruitful.Yes, the familiar house and the garden will be my aversion.Ah, and the love of my mother no comfort will give to my sorrow,For I feel that by Love each former bond must be loosen'd,When her own bonds she knits; 'tis not the maiden alone whoLeaves her father and mother behind, when she follows her husband.So it is with the youth; no more he knows mother and father.When he beholds the maiden, the only beloved one, approaching.Therefore let me go hence, to where desperation may lead me,For my father already has spoken in words of decision,And his house no longer is mine, if he shuts out the maidenWhom alone I would fain take home as my bride from henceforward.""

ííííThen the excellent sensible mother answer'd with quickness""Men are precisely like rocks when they stand opposed to each other!Proud and unyielding, the one will never draw near to the other.Neither will suffer his tongue to utter the first friendly accent.Therefore I tell you, my son, a hope still exists in my bosom,If she is worthy and good, he will give his consent to your marriage,Poor though she be, and although with disdain he refused you the poor thing.For in his hot-beaded fashion he utters many expressionsWhich he never intends; and so will accept the Refused One.But he requires kind words, and has a right to require them,For your father he is; his anger is all after dinner,When he more eagerly speaks, and questions the reasons of others,Meaning but little thereby; the wine then excites all the vigourOf his impetuous will, and prevents him from giving due weight toOther people's opinions; he hears and he feels his own only.But when evening arrives, the tone of the many discoursesWhich his friends and himself hold together, is very much alter'd.Milder becomes he, as soon as his liquor's effects have passed overAnd he feels the injustice his eagerness did unto others.Come, we will venture at once! Success the reward is of boldness,And we have need of the friends who now have assembled around him.--Most of all we shall want the help of our excellent pastor.""Thus she eagerly spoke, and leaving the stone that she sat on,Also lifted her son from his seat. He willingly follow'd,And they descended in silence, revolving the weighty proposal.-----V. POLYHYMNIA.

ííííTHE COSMOPOLITE.

ííííBUT the Three, as before, were still sitting and talking together,With the landlord, the worthy divine, and also the druggist,And the conversation still concern'd the same subject,Which in every form they had long been discussing together.Full of noble thoughts, the excellent pastor continued""I can't contradict you. I know 'tis the duty of mortalsEver to strive for improvement; and, as we may see, they strive alsoEver for that which is higher, at least what is new they seek after,But don't hurry too fast! For combined with these feelings, kind NatureAlso has given us pleasure in dwelling on that which is ancient,And in clinging to that to which we have long been accustom'd.Each situation is good that's accordant to nature and reason.Many things man desires, and yet he has need of but little;For but short are the days, and confined is the lot of a mortal.I can never blame the man who, active and restless,Hurries along, and explores each corner of earth and the oceanBoldly and carefully, while he rejoices at seeing the profitsWhich round him and his family gather themselves in abundance.But I also duly esteem the peaceable burgher,Who with silent steps his paternal inheritance paces,And watches over the earth, the seasons carefully noting.'Tis not every year that he finds his property alter'd;Newly-planted trees cannot stretch out their arms tow'rds the heavensAll in a moment, adorn'd with beautiful buds in abundance.No, a man has need of patience, he also has need ofPure unruffled tranquil thoughts and an intellect honest;For to the nourishing earth few seeds at a time he entrusteth,Few are the creatures he keeps at a time, with a view to their breeding,For what is Useful alone remains the first thought of his lifetime.Happy the man to whom Nature a mind thus attuned may have given!'Tis by him that we all are fed. And happy the townsmanOf the small town who unites the vocations of town and of country.He is exempt from the pressure by which the poor farmer is worried,Is not perplex'd by the citizens' cares and soaring ambition,Who, with limited means,--especially women and maidens,--Think of nothing but aping the ways of the great and the wealthy,You should therefore bless your son's disposition so peaceful,And the like-minded wife whom we soon may expect him to marry.

ííííThus he spoke. At that moment the mother and son stood before them.By the hand she led him and placed him in front of her husband""Father,"" she said, ""how often have we, when talking together,Thought of that joyful day in the future, when Hermann, selectingAfter long waiting his bride at length would make us both happy!All kinds of projects we form'd. designing first one, then anotherGirl as his wife, as we talk'd in the manner that parents delight in.Now the day has arrived; and now has his bride been conductedHither and shown him by Heaven; his heart at length has decided.Were we not always saying that he should choose for himself, andWere you not lately wishing that he might feel for a maidenWarm and heart-felt emotions? And now has arrived the right moment!Yes, he has felt and has chosen, and like a man has decided.That fair maiden it is, the Stranger whom he encounter'd.Give her him; else he'll remain--he has sworn it--unmarried for ever.""

ííííAnd the son added himself:--""My father, O give her! My heart hasChosen purely and truly: she'll make you an excellent daughter.""

ííííBut the father was silent. Then suddenly rose the good pastor,And address'd him as follows:--"" One single moment's decisiveBoth of the life of a man, and of the whole of his Future.After lengthen'd reflection, each resolution made by himIs but the work of a moment; the prudent alone seize the right one.Nothing more dangerous is, in making a choice, than revolvingFirst this point and then that, and so confusing the feelings.Pure is Hermann's mind; from his youth I have known him; he never,Even in boyhood, was wont to extend his hand hither and thither.What he desired, was suitable to him; he held to it firmly.Be not astonish'd and scared, because there appears on a suddenWhat you so long have desired. 'Tis true the appearance at presentBears not the shape of the wish, as you in your mind had conceived it.For our wishes conceal the thing that we wish for; our gifts tooCome from above upon us, each clad in its own proper figure.Do not now mistake the maiden who has succeededFirst in touching the heart of your good wise son, whom you love so.Happy is he who is able to clasp the hand of his first love,And whose dearest wish is not doom'd to pine in his bosom!Yes, I can see by his face, already his fate is decided;True affection converts the youth to a man in a moment.He little changeable is; I fear me, if this you deny him,All the fairest years of his life will be changed into sorrow.""

ííííThen in prudent fashion the druggist, who long had been wantingHis opinion to give, rejoin'd in the following manner""This is Just a case when the middle course is the wisest!'Hasten slowly,' you know, was the motto of Caesar Augustus.I am always ready to be of use to my neighbours,And to turn to their profit what little wits I can boast of.Youth especially needs the guidance of those who are older.Let me then depart; I fain would prove her, that maiden,And will examine the people 'mongst whom she lives, and who know her.I am not soon deceived; I know how to rate their opinions.""

ííííThen forthwith replied the son, with eagerness speaking:--""Do so, neighbour, and go, make your inquiries. However,I should greatly prefer that our friend, the pastor, went with you;Two such excellent men are witnesses none can find fault with.O, my father! the maiden no vagabond is, I assure you,No mere adventurer, wand'ring about all over the country,And deceiving the inexperienced youths with her cunning;No! the harsh destiny link'd with this war, so destructive of all things,Which is destroying the world, and already has wholly uprootedMany a time-honour'd fabric, has driven the poor thing to exile.Are not brave men of noble birth now wand'ring in mis'ry?Princes are fleeing disguised, and monarchs in banishment living.Ah, and she also herself, the best of her sisters, is drivenOut of her native land; but her own misfortunes forgetting,Others she seeks to console, and, though helpless, is also most helpful.Great are the woes and distress which over the earth's face are brooding,But may happiness not be evoked from out of this sorrow?May not I, in the arms of my bride, the wife I have chosen,Even rejoice at the war, as you at the great conflagration?""

ííííThen replied the father, and open'd his mouth with importance:--""Strangely indeed, my son, has your tongue been suddenly loosen'd,Which for years has stuck in your mouth, and moved there but rarelyI to-day must experience that which threatens each father:How the ardent will of a son a too-gentle motherWillingly favours, whilst each neighbour is ready to back him,Only provided it be at the cost of a father or husband!But what use would it be to resist so many together?For I see that defiance and tears will otherwise greet me.Go and prove her, and in God's name then hasten to bring herHome as my daughter; if not, he must think no more of the maiden.""

ííííThus spake the father. The son exclaim'd with jubilant gesture""Ere the ev'ning arrives, you shall have the dearest of daughters,Such as the man desires whose bosom is govern'd by prudenceAnd I venture to think the good creature is fortunate also.Yes, she will ever be grateful that I her father and motherHave restored her in you, as sensible children would wish it.But I will loiter no longer; I'll straightway harness the horses,And conduct our friends on the traces of her whom I love so,Leave the men to themselves and their own intuitive wisdom,And be guided alone by their decision--I swear it,--And not see the maiden again, until she my own is.""Then he left the house; meanwhile the others were eagerlySettling many a point, and the weighty matter debating.

ííííHermann sped to the stable forthwith, where the spirited stallionsTranquilly stood and with eagerness swallow'd the pure oats before them,And the well-dried hay, which was cut from the best of their meadows.Then in eager haste in their mouths the shining bits placed he,Quickly drew the harness through the well-plated buckles,And then fastend the long broad reins in proper position,Led the horses out in the yard, where already the carriage,Easily moved along by its pole, had been push'd by the servant.Then they restrain'd the impetuous strength of the fast-moving horses,Fastening both with neat-looking ropes to the bar of the carriage.Hermann seized his whip, took his seat, and drove to the gateway.When in the roomy carriage his friends had taken their places,Swiftly he drove away, and left the pavement behind them,Left behind the walls of the town and the clean-looking towers,Thus sped Hermann along, till he reach'd the familiar highway,Not delaying a moment, and galloping uphill and downhill.When however at length the village steeple descried he,And not far away lay the houses surrounded by gardens,He began to think it was time to hold in the horses.

ííííBy the time-honour'd gloom of noble lime-trees o'er shadow'd,Which for many a century past on the spot had been rooted,Stood there a green and spreading grass-plot in front of the village,Cover'd with turf, for the peasants and neighbouring townsmen a playground.Scooped out under the trees, to no great depth, stood a fountain.On descending the steps, some benches of stone might be seen there,Ranged all around the spring, which ceaselessly well'd forth its waters,Cleanly, enclosed by a low wall all round, and convenient to draw from.Hermann then determined beneath the shadow his horsesWith the carriage to stop. He did so, and spoke then as follows""Now, my friends, get down, and go by yourselves to discoverWhether the maiden is worthy to have the hand which I offer.I am convinced that she is; and you'll bring me no new or strange story:Had I to manage alone, I would straightway go off to the village,And in few words should my fate by the charming creature be settled.

ííííHer you will easily recognize 'mongst all the rest of the people,For her appearance is altogether unlike that of others.But I will now describe the modest dress she is wearing:--First a bodice red her well-arch'd bosom upraises,Prettily tied, while black are the stays fitting closely around her.Then the seams of the ruff she has carefully plaited and folded,Which with modest grace, her chin so round is encircling.Free and joyously rises her head with its elegant oval,Strongly round bodkins of silver her back-hair is many times twistedHer blue well-plaited gown begins from under her bodice.And as she walks envelopes her well-turn'd ankles completely.But I have one thing to say, and this must expressly entreat you:Do not speak to the maiden, and let not your scheme be discover'd.But inquire of others, and hearken to all that they tell you,When you have learnt enough to satisfy father and mother,Then return to me straight, and we'll settle future proceedings.This is the plan which I have matured, while driving you hither.""

ííííThus he spoke, and the friends forthwith went on to the village,Where, in gardens and barns and houses, the multitude crowded;All along the broad road the numberless carts were collected,Men were feeding the lowing cattle and feeding the horses.Women on every hedge the linen were carefully drying,Whilst the children in glee were splashing about in the streamlet.Forcing their way through the waggons, and past the men and the cattle,Walk'd the ambassador spies, looking well to the righthand and lefthand,Hoping somewhere to see the form of the well-described maiden;But wherever they look'd, no trace of the girl they discover'd.

ííííPresently denser became the crowd. Round some of the waggons.Men in a passion were quarrelling, women also were screaming.Then of a sudden approach'd an aged man with firm footstepMarching straight up to the fighters; and forthwith was hush'd the contention,When he bade them be still, and with fatherly earnestness threaten'd.""Are we not yet,"" he exclaim'd, ""by misfortune so knitted together,As to have learnt at length the art of reciprocal patienceAnd toleration, though each cannot measure the actions of others?Prosperous men indeed may quarrel! Will sorrow not teach youHow no longer as formerly you should quarrel with brethren?Each should give way to each other, when treading the soil of the stranger,And, as you hope for mercy yourselves, you should share your possessions.""

ííííThus the man address'd them, and all were silent. In peacefulHumour the reconciled men look'd after their cattle and waggons.When the pastor heard the man discourse in this fashion,And the foreign magistrate's peaceful nature discovered,He approach'd him in turn, and used this significant language""Truly, Father, when nations are living in days of good fortune,Drawing their food from the earth, which gladly opens its treasures,And its wish'd-for gifts each year and each month is renewing,Then all matters go smoothly; each thinks himself far the wisest,And the best, and so they exist by the side of each other,And the most sensible man no better than others is reckon'dFor the world moves on, as if by itself and in silence.But when distress unsettles our usual manner of living,Pulls down each time-honour'd fabric, and roots up the seed in our gardens,Drives the man and his wife far away from the home they delight in,Hurries them off in confusion through days and nights full of anguish,Ah! then look we around in search of the man who is wisest,And no longer in vain he utters his words full of wisdom.Tell me whether you be these fugitives' magistrate, Father,Over whose minds you appear to possess such an influence soothing?Aye, to-day I could deem you one of the leaders of old time,Who through wastes and through deserts conducted the wandering people;I could imagine 'twas Joshua I am addressing, or Moses.""

ííííThen with solemn looks the magistrate answer'd as follows""Truly the present times resemble the strangest of old times,Which are preserved in the pages of history, sacred or common.He in these days who has lived to-day and yesterday only,Many a year has lived, events so crowd on each other.When I reflect back a little, a grey old age I could fancyOn my head to be lying, and yet my strength is still active.Yes, we people in truth may liken ourselves to those othersUnto whom in a fiery bush appear'd, in a solemnMoment, the Lord our God; in fire and clouds we behold him.""

ííííWhen the pastor would fain continue to speak on this subject,And was anxious to learn the fate of the man and his party,Quickly into his ear his companion secretly whisper'd""Speak for a time with the magistrate, turning your talk on the maiden,Whilst I wander about, endeav'ring to find her. DirectlyI am successful, I'll join you again."" Then nodded the pastor,And the spy went to seek her, in barns and through hedges and gardens.-----VI. KLIO.

ííííTHE AGE.

ííííWHEN the pastor ask'd the foreign magistrate questions,What the people had suffer'd, how long from their homes they had wander'd,Then the man replied:--""By no means short are our sorrows,For we have drunk the bitters of many a long year together,All the more dreadful, because our fairest hopes have been blighted.Who can deny that his heart beat wildly and high in his bosomAnd that with purer pulses his breast more freely was throbbing,When the newborn sun first rose in the whole of its glory,When we heard of the right of man, to have all things in common,Heard of noble Equality, and of inspiriting Freedom!Each man then hoped to attain new life for himself, and the fettersWhich had encircled many a land appear'd to be broken,Fetters held by the hands of sloth and selfish indulgence.Did not all nations turn their gaze, in those days of emotion,Tow'rds the world's capital, which so many a long year had been so,And then more than ever deserved a name so distinguish'd?Were not the men, who first proclaim'd so noble a message,Names that are worthy to rank with the highest the sun ever shone on,Did not each give to mankind his courage and genius and language?

íííí""And we also, as neighbours, at first were warmly excited.Presently after began the war, and the train of arm'd FrenchmenNearer approach'd; at first they appear'd to bring with them friendship,And they brought it in fact; for all their souls were exalted.And the gay trees of liberty ev'rywhere gladly they planted,Promising unto each his own, and the government long'd for.Greatly at this was youth, and greatly old age was delighted,And the joyous dance began round the newly-raised standards.In this manner the overpowering Frenchmen soon conquer'dFirst the minds of the men, with their fiery lively proceedings,Then the hearts of the women, with irresistible graces.Even the strain of the war, with its many demands, seem'd but trifling,For before our eyes the distance by hope was illumined,Luring our gaze far ahead into paths now first open'd before us.""O how joyful the time, when with his bride the glad bridegroomWhirls in the dance, awaiting the day that will join them for everBut more glorious far was the time when the Highest of all thingsWhich man's mind can conceive, close by and attainable seemed.Then were the tongues of all loosen'd, and words of wisdom and feelingNot by greybeards alone, but by men and by striplings were utter'd.

íííí""But the heavens soon clouded became. For the sake of the mast'ryStrove a contemptible crew, unfit to accomplish good actions.Then they murder'd each other, and took to oppressing their new-foundNeighbours and brothers, and sent on missions whole herds of self─seekersAnd the superiors took to carousing and robbing by wholesale,And the inferiors down to the lowest caroused and robb'd also.Nobody thought of aught else than having enough for tomorrow.Terrible was the distress, and daily increased the oppression.None the cry understood, that they of the day were the masters.Then even temperate minds were attack'd by sorrow and fury;Each one reflected, and swore to avenge all the injuries suffer'd,And to atone for the hitter loss of hopes twice defrauded.Presently Fortune declared herself on the side of the Germans,And the French were compell'd to retreat by forced marches before them.Ah! the sad fate of the war we then for the first time experienced.For the victor is kind and humane, at least he appears so,And he spares the man he has vanquish'd, as if he his own were,When he employs him daily, and with his property helps him.But the fugitive knows no law; he wards off death only,And both quickly and recklessly all that he meets with, consumes he.Then his mind becomes heated apace; and soon desperationFills his heart, and impels him to all kinds of criminal actions.Nothing then holds he respected, he steals It. With furious longingOn the woman he rushes; his lust becomes awful to think of.Death all around him he sees, his last minutes in cruelty spends he,Wildly exulting in blood, and exulting in howls and in anguish.

íííí""Then in the minds of our men arose a terrible yearningThat which was lost to avenge, and that which remain'd to defend still.All of them seized upon arms, lured on by the fugitives' hurry,By their pale faces, and by their shy, uncertain demeanour.There was heard the sound of alarm-bells unceasingly ringing,And the approach of danger restrain'd not their violent fury.Soon into weapons were turn'd the implements peaceful of tillage,And with dripping blood the scythe and the pitchfork were cover'd.Every foeman without distinction was ruthlessly slaughter'd,Fury was ev'rywhere raging, and artful, cowardly weakness.May I never again see men in such wretched confusion!Even the raging wild beast is a better object to gaze on.Ne'er let them speak of freedom, as if themselves they could govern!All the evil which Law has driven farback in the cornerSeems to escape, as soon as the fetters which bound it are loosen'd.""

íííí""Excellent man,"" replied the pastor, with emphasis speaking""If you're mistaken in man, 'tis not for me to reprove you.Evil enough have you suffer'd indeed from his cruel proceedings!Would you but look back, however, on days so laden with sorrow,You would yourself confess how much that is good you have witness'd,Much that is excellent, which remains conceald in the bossomTill by danger 'tis stirr'd, and till necessity makes manShow himself as an angel, a tutelar God unto others.""

ííííThen with a smile replied the worthy old magistrate, saying""Your reminder is wise, like that which they give to the suff'rerWho has had his dwelling burnt down, that under the ruins,Gold and silver are lying, though melted and cover'd with ashes.Little, indeed, it may be, and yet that little is precious,And the poor man digs it up, and rejoices at finding the treasure.Gladly, therefore, I turn my thoughts to those few worthy actionsWhich my memory still is able to dwell on with pleasure.Yes, I will not deny it, I saw late foemen unitingSo as to save the town from harm; I saw with devotionParents, children and friends impossible actions attempting,Saw how the youth of a sudden became a man, how the greybeardOnce more was young, how the child as a stripling appear'd in a moment.Aye, and the weaker sex, as people commonly call it,Show'd itself brave and daring, with presence of mind all-unwonted.Let me now, in the first place, describe a deed of rare meritBy a high-spirited girl accomplish'd, an excellent maiden,Who in the great farmhouse remain'd behind with the servants,When the whole of the men had departed, to fight with the strangers.Well, there fell on the court a troop of vagabond scoundrels,Plund'ring and forcing their way inside the rooms of the women.Soon they cast their eyes on the forms of the grown-up fair maidenAnd of the other dear girls, in age little more than mere children.Hurried away by raging desire, unfeelingly rush'd theyOn the trembling band, and on the high-spirited maiden.But she instantly seized the sword from the side of a ruffian,Hew'd him down to the ground; at her feet straight fell he, all bleeding,Then with doughty strokes the maidens she bravely deliver'd.Wounded four more of the robbers; with life, however, escaped they.Then she lock'd up the court, and, arm'd still, waited for succour.

ííííWhen the pastor heard the praise of the maiden thus utter'dFeelings of hope for his friend forthwith arose in his bosom,And he prepared to ask what had been the fate of the damsel,Whether she, in the sorrowful flight, form'd one of the people?At this moment, however, the druggist nimbly approach'd them,Pull'd the sleeve of the pastor, and whisper'd to him as follows""I have at last pick'd out the maiden from many a hundredBy her description! Pray come and judge for yourself with your own eyes;Bring the magistrate with you, that we may learn the whole story.""

ííííSo they turn'd themselves round; but the magistrate found himself summon'dBy his own followers, who had need of his presence and counsel.But the pastor forthwith the druggist accompanied, till theyCame to a gap in the hedge, when the latter pointed with slyness,""See you,"" exclaim'd he, ""the maiden? The child's clothes she has been changing.And I recognise well the old calico--also the cushion--Cover of blue, which Hermann took in the bundle and gave her.Quickly and well, of a truth, she has used the presents left with her.These are evident proofs; and all the rest coincide too;For a bodice red her well-arch'd bosom upraises,Prettily tied, while black are the stays fitting close around her.Then the seams of the ruff she has carefully plaited and folded,Which, with modest grace, her chin so round is encircling;Free and joyously rises her head, with its elegant oval,Strongly round bodkins of silver her back-hair is many times twisted.When she is sitting, we plainly see her noble proportions,And the blue well-plaited gown which begins from close to her bosom,And in rich folds descending, her well-turn'd ankles envelops.'Tis she, beyond all doubt. So come, that we may examineWhether she be both a good and a frugal and virtuous maiden.""Then the pastor rejoin'd, the sitting damsel inspecting""That she enchanted the youth, I confess is no matter of wonder,For she stands the test of the gaze of a man of experience.Happy the person to whom Mother Nature the right face has given!She recommends him at all times, he never appears as a stranger,Each one gladly approaches, and each one beside him would linger,If with his face is combined a pleasant and courteous demeanour.Yes, I assure you the youth has indeed discover'd a maidenWho the whole of the days of his life will enliven with gladness,And with her womanly strength assist him at all times and truly.Thus a perfect body preserves the soul also in pureness,And a vigorous youth of a happy old age gives assurance.

ííííAfter reflecting a little, the druggist made answer as follows:--""Yet appearances oft are deceitful. I trust not the outside.Often, indeed, have I found the truth of the proverb which tells usEre you share a bushel of salt with a new-found acquaintance,Do not trust him too readily; time will make you more certainHow you and he will get on, and whether your friendship is lasting.Let us then, in the first place, inquire amongst the good peopleUnto whom the maiden is known, who can tell us about her.""

íííí""Well, of a truth I commend your prudence,"" the pastor continued""Not for ourselves are we wooing! To woo for others is serious.""So they started to meet the worthy magistrate seeingHow in the course of his business he was ascending the main street.And the wise pastor straightway address'd him with foresight as follows""We, by-the-bye, have just seen a girl in the neighbouring gardenUnder an apple-tree sitting, and clothes for the children preparing,Made of worn calico, which for the purpose was doubtless presented.We were pleased by her face; she appears to be one of the right sort.Tell us, what know you about her? We ask from a laudable motive.""

ííííWhen the magistrate came to the garden and peep'd in, exclaimed he""Well do I know her, in truth; for when I told you the storyOf that noble deed which was done by the maiden I spoke of,How she seized on the sword, and defended herself, and the servants,She the heroine was! You can see how active her nature.But she's as good as she's strong; for her aged kinsman she tendedUntil the time of his death, for he died overwhelm'd by afflictionAt the distress of his town, and the danger his goods were exposed to.Also with mute resignation she bore the grievous afflictionOf her betroth'd's sad death, a noble young man who, incitedBy the first fire of noble thoughts to struggle for freedom,Went himself to Paris, and soon found a terrible death there.For, as at home, so there, he fought 'gainst intrigue and oppression.""

ííííThus the magistrate spoke. The others departed and thanked him,And the pastor produced a gold piece (the silver his purse heldHe some hours before had with genuine kindness expendedWhen he saw the fugitives passing in sorrowful masses).

ííííAnd to the magistrate handed it, saying:--"" Divide it, I pray you,'Mongst those who need it the most. May God give it prosperous increase.""

ííííBut the man refused to accept it, and said:--""I assure you,Many a dollar we've saved, and plenty of clothing and such things,And I trust we may reach our homes before they are finish'd.""

ííííThen continued the pastor, the gold in his hand once more placing""None should delay to give in days like the present, and no oneOught to refuse to receive what is offer'd with liberal kindness.No one can tell how long he will keep what in peace he possesses,No one, how long he is doom'd in foreign countries to wander,While he's deprived of the field and the garden by which he is nurtured.""

íííí""Bravo!"" added in turn the druggist, with eagerness speaking""Had I but money to spare in my pocket, you surely should have it,Silver and gold alike; for your followers certainly need it.Yet I'll not leave you without a present, if only to show youMy good will, and I hope you will take the will for the action.""Thus he spoke, and pull'd out by the strings the leather embroider'dPouch, in which he was wont his stock of tobacco to carry,Daintily open'd and shared its contents--some two or three pipes' full.""Small in truth is the gift,"" he added. The magistrate answered:""Good tobacco is always a welcome present to trav'llers.""Then the druggist began his canister to praise very highly.But the pastor drew him away, and the magistrate left them.""Come, let us hasten!"" exclaimed the sensible man, ""for our young friendAnxiously waits; without further delay let him hear the good tidings.""

ííííSo they hasten'd and came, and found that the youngster was leaning'Gainst his carriage under the lime-trees. The horses were pawingWildly the turf; he held them in check and stood there all pensive,Silently gazing in front, and saw not his friends coming near him,Till, as they came, they called him and gave him signals of triumph.Some way off the druggist already began to address him,But they approach'd the youth still nearer, and then the good pastorSeized his hand and spoke and took the word from his comrade""Friend, I wish you joy! Your eye so true and your true heartRightly have chosen! May you and the wife of your young days be happy!She is full worthy of you; so come and turn around the carriage,That we may reach without delay the end of the village,So as to woo her, and shortly escort the dear creature home with us.""But the youth stood still, and without any token of pleasureHeard the words of the envoy, though sounding consoling and heav'nly,Deeply sigh'd and said:--""We came full speed in the carriageAnd shall probably go back home ashamed and but slowly;For, since I have been waiting care has fallen upon me,Doubt and suspicion and all that a heart full of love is exposed to.Do you suppose we have only to come, for the maiden to follow,Just because we are rich, and she poor and wandering in exile?Poverty, when undeserved, itself makes proud. The fair maidenSeems to be active and frugal; the world she may claim as her portion.Do you suppose that a woman of such great beauty and mannersCan have grown up without exciting love in man's bosom?Do you suppose that her heart until now has to love been fast closed?Do not drive thither in haste, for perchance to our shame and confusionWe shall have slowly to turn towards home the heads of our horses.Yes, some youth, I fear me, possesses her heart, and alreadyShe has doubtless promised her hand and her solemn troth plighted,And I shall stand all ashamed before her, When making my offer.""

ííííThen the pastor proceeded to cheer him with words of good comfort,But his companion broke in, in his usual talkative manner""As things used to be, this embarrassment would not have happened,When each matter was brought to a close in an orthodox fashion.Then for their son themselves the bride the parents selected,And a friend of the house was secretly call'd in the first place.He was then quietly sent as a suitor to visit the parentsOf the selected bride; and, dress'd in his gayest apparel,Went after dinner some Sunday to visit the excellent burgher,And began by exchanging polite remarks on all subjects,Cleverly turning and bending the talk in the proper direction.After long beating about the bush, he flatter'd the daughter,And spoke well of the man and the house that gave his commission.Sensible people soon saw his drift, and the sensible envoyWatch'd how the notion was taken, and then could explain himself farther.If they declined the proposal, why then the refusal cost nothing,But if all prosper'd, why then the suitor for ever thereafterPlay'd the first fiddle at every family feast and rejoicing.For the married couple remember'd the whole of their lifetimeWhose was the skilful hand by which the marriage knot tied was.All this now is chang'd, and with many an excellent customHas gone quite out of fashion. Each person woos for himself now.Everyone now must bear the weight of a maiden's refusalOn his own shoulders, and stand all ashamed before her, if needs be.""

íííí""Let that be as it may,"" then answered the young man who scarcelyHeard what was said, and his mind had made up already in silence""I will go myself, and out of the mouth of the maidenLearn my own fate, for towards her I cherish the most trustful feelingsThat any man ever cherish'd towards any woman whatever.That which she says will be good and sensible,--this I am sure of.If I am never to see her again, I must once more behold her,And the ingenuous gaze of her black eyes must meet for the last time.If to my heart I may clasp her never, her bosom and shouldersI would once more see, which my arm so longs to encircle:Once more the mouth I would see, from which one kiss and a Yes willMake me happy for ever, a No for ever undo me.But now leave me alone! Wait here no longer. Return youStraight to my father and mother, in order to tell them in personThat their son was right, and that the maiden is worthy.And so leave me alone! I myself shall return by the footpathOver the hill by the pear-tree and then descend through the vineyard,Which is the shortest way back. Oh may I soon with rejoicingTake the beloved one home! But perchance all alone I must slink backBy that path to our house and tread it no more with a light heart.""Thus he spoke, and then placed the reins in the hands of the pastor,Who, in a knowing way both the foaming horses restraining,Nimbly mounted the carriage, and took the seat of the driver.

ííííBut you still delay'd, good cautious neighbour, and spoke thusFriend, I will gladly entrust to you soul, and spirit, and mind too,But my body and bones are not preserved in the best wayWhen the hand of a parson such worldly matters as reins grasps!""

ííííBut you smiled in return, you sensible pastor, replying""Pray jump in, nor fear with both body and spirit to trust me,For this hand to hold the reins has long been accustom'd,And these eyes are train'd to turn the corner with prudence.For we were wont to drive the carriage, when living at Strasburg,At the time when with the young baron I went there, for daily,Driven by me, through the echoing gateway thunder'd the carriageBy the dusty roads to distant meadows and lindens,Through the crowds of the people who spend their lifetime in walking.""

ííííPartially comforted, then his neighbour mounted the carriage,Sitting like one prepared to make a wise jump, if needs be,And the stallions, eager to reach their stables, coursed homewards,While beneath their powerful hoofs the dust rose in thick clouds.Long there stood the youth, and saw the dust rise before him,Saw the dust disperse; but still he stood there, unthinking.-----VII. ERATO.

ííííDOROTHEA.

ííííAs the man on a journey, who, just at the moment of sunset,Fixes his gaze once more on the rapidly vanishing planet,Then on the side of the rocks and in the dark thicket still sees heHov'ring its image; wherever he turns his looks, on in front stillRuns it, and glitters and wavers before him in colours all splendid,So before Hermanns eyes did the beautiful form of the maidenSoftly move, and appear'd to follow the path through the cornfields.

ííííBut he roused himself up from his startling dream, and then slowlyTurn'd tow'rd the village his steps, and once more started,--for once moreSaw he the noble maiden's stately figure approaching.Fixedly gazed he; it was no phantom in truth; she herself 'twasIn her hands by the handle she carried two pitchers,--one larger,One of a smaller size, and nimbly walk'd to the fountain.And he joyfully went to meet her; the sight of her gave himCourage and strength, and so he address'd the surprised one as follows:--""Do I find you again, brave maiden, engaged in assistingOthers so soon, and in giving refreshment to those who may need it?Tell me why you have come all alone to the spring so far distant,Whilst the rest are content with the water that's found in the village?This one, indeed, special virtue possesses, and pleasant to drink is.Is't for the sake of that sick one you come, whom you saved with such courage?""

ííííThen the good maiden the youth in friendly fashion saluted,Saying:--""Already my walk to the fountain is fully rewarded,Since I have found the kind person who gave us so many good presents;For the sight of a giver, like that of a gift, is refreshing.Come and see for yourself the persons who tasted your kindness,And receive the tranquil thanks of all you have aided.But that you may know the reason why I have come here,Water to draw at a spot where the spring is both pure and unceasing,I must inform you that thoughtless men have disturb'd all the waterFound in the village, by carelessly letting the horses and oxenWade about in the spring which give the inhabitants water.In the same manner, with all their washing and cleaning they've dirtiedAll the troughs of the village, and all the fountains have sullied.For each one of them only thinks how quickly and soon heMay supply his own wants, and cares not for those who come after.""

ííííThus she spoke, and soon she arrived at the foot of the broad stepsWith her companion, and both of them sat themselves down on the low wallRound the spring. She bent herself over, to draw out the water,He the other pitcher took up, and bent himself over,And in the blue of the heavens they saw their figures reflected,Waving, and nodding, and in the mirror their greetings exchanging.""Now let me drink,"" exclaim'd the youth in accents of gladness.And she gave him the pitcher. They then, like old friends, sat together,Leaning against the vessels, when she address'd him as follows""Say, why find I you here without your carriage and horses,Far from the place where first I saw you. Pray how came you hither?""

ííííHermann thoughtfully gazed on the ground, but presently liftedCalmly towards her his glances, and gazed on her face in kind fashion,Feeling quite calm and composed. And yet with love to address herFound he quite out of the question; for love from her eyes was not beaming,But an intellect clear, which bade him use sensible language.Soon he collected his thoughts, and quietly said to the maiden:--""Let me speak, my child, and let me answer your questions.""'Tis for your sake alone I have come,--why seek to conceal it?For I happily live with two affectionate parents,Whom I faithfully help to look after our house and possessions,Being an only son, while numerous are our employments.I look after the field work; the house is carefully managedBy my father; my mother the hostelry cheers and enlivens.But you also have doubtless found out how greatly the servants,Sometimes by fraud, and sometimes by levity, worry their mistress,Constantly making her change them, and barter one fault for another.Long has my mother, therefore, been wanting a girl in the household,Who, not only with hand, but also with heart might assist her,In the place of the daughter she lost, alas, prematurely.Now when I saw you to-day near the carriage, so active and sprightly,Saw the strength of your arm and the perfect health of your members,When I heard your sensible words, I was struck with amazement,And I hasten'd back home, deservedly praising the strangerBoth to my parents and friends. And now I come to inform youWhat they desire, as I do. Forgive my stammering language!""

íííí""Do not hesitate,"" said she, ""to tell me the rest of your storyI have with gratitude felt that you have not sought to insult me.Speak on boldly, I pray; your words shall never alarm me;You would fain hire me now as maid to your father and mother,To look after the house, which now is in excellent order.And you think that in me you have found a qualified maiden,One that is able to work, and not of a quarrelsome nature.Your proposal was short, and short shall my answer be alsoYes! with you I will go, and the voice of my destiny follow.I have fulfill'd my duty, and brought the lying-in womanBack to her friends again, who all rejoice at her rescue.Most of them now are together, the rest will presently join them.All expect that they, in a few short days, will be ableHomewards to go; 'tis thus that exiles themselves love to flatter.But I cannot deceive myself with hopes so delusiveIn these sad days which promise still sadder days in the futureFor all the bonds of the world are loosen'd, and nought can rejoin them,Save that supreme necessity over our future impending.If in the house of so worthy a man I can earn my own living,Serving under the eye of his excellent wife, I will do so;For a wandering girl bears not the best reputation.Yes! with you I will go, as soon as I've taken the pitcherBack to my friends, and received the blessing of those worthy people.Come! you needs must see them, and from their hands shall receive me.""

ííííJoyfully heard the youth the willing maiden's decision,Doubting whether he now had not better tell her the whole truth;But it appear'd to him best to let her remain in her error,First to take her home, and then for her love to entreat her.Ah! but now he espied a golden ring on her finger,And so let her speak, while he attentively listen'd:--

íííí""Let us now return,"" she continued, ""the custom is alwaysTo admonish the maidens who tarry too long at the fountain,Yet how delightful it is by the fast-flowing water to chatter!""Then they both arose, and once more directed their glancesInto the fountain, and then a blissful longing came o'er them.

ííííSo from the ground by the handles she silently lifted the pitchers,Mounted the steps of the well, and Hermann follow'd the loved one.One of the pitchers he ask'd her to give him, thus sharing the burden.""Leave it,"" she said, ""the weight feels less when thus they are balanced;And the master I've soon to obey, should not be my servant.Gaze not so earnestly at me, as if my fate were still doubtfull!Women should learn betimes to serve, according to station,For by serving alone she attains at last to the mast'ry,To the due influence which she ought to possess in the household.Early the sister must learn to serve her brothers and parents,And her life is ever a ceaseless going and coming,Or a lifting and carrying, working and doing for others.Well for her, if she finds no manner of life too offensive,And if to her the hours of night and of day all the same are,So that her work never seems too mean, her needle too pointed,So that herself she forgets, and liveth only for others!For as a mother in truth she needs the whole of the virtues,When the suckling awakens the sick one, and nourishment calls forFrom the exhausted parent, heaping cares upon suff'ring.Twenty men together could not endure such a burden,And they ought not,--and yet they gratefully ought to behold it.""

ííííThus she spoke, and with her silent companion advanced sheThrough the garden, until the floor of the granary reach'd they,Where the sick woman lay, whom she left by her daughters attended,Those dear rescued maidens, the types of innocent beauty.Both of them enter'd the room, and from the other direction,Holding a child in each hand, her friend, the magistrate, enter'd.These had lately been lost for some time by the sorrowing mother,But the old man had now found them out in the crowd of the people.And they sprang in with joy, to greet their dearly-loved mother,To rejoice in a brother, the playmate now seen for the first time!

ííííThen on Dorothea they sprang, and greeted her warmly,Asking for bread and fruit, but asking for drink before all things.And they handed the water all round. The children first drank some,Then the sick woman drank, with her daughters, the magistrate also.All were refresh'd, and sounded the praise of the excellent water;Mineral was it, and very reviving, and wholesome for drinking.

ííííThen with a serious look continued the maiden, and spoke thusFriends, to your mouths for the last time in truth I have lifted the pitcher,And for the last time, alas, have moisten'd your lips with pure water.But whenever in scorching heat your drink may refresh you,And in the shade you enjoy repose and a fountain unsullied,Then remember me, and all my friendly assistance,Which I from love, and not from relationship merely have render'd.All your kindness to me, as long as life lasts, I'll remember,I unwillingly leave you; but each one is now to each otherRather a burden than comfort. We all must shortly be scatter'dOver a foreign land, unless to return we are able.See, here stands the youth to whom for those gifts we're indebted,All those clothes for the child, and all those acceptable viands.Well, he has come, and is anxious that I to his house should go with him,There as a servant to act to his rich and excellent parents,And I have not refused him, for serving appears my vocation,And to be served by others at home would seem like a burden.So I'll go willingly with him; the youth appears to be prudent,Thus will his parents be properly cared for, as rich people should be.Therefore, now, farewell, my much-loved friend, and be joyfulIn your living infant, who looks so healthily at you.When you press him against your bosom, wrapp'd up in those colourdSwaddling-clothes, then remember the youth who so kindly bestow'd them,And who in future will feed and clothe me also, your loved friend.You too, excellent man,"" to the magistrate turning, she added""Warmly I thank for so often acting the part of a father.""

ííííThen she knelt herself down before the lying-in patient,Kiss'd the weeping woman, her whisper'd blessing receiving.Meanwhile the worthy magistrate spoke to Hermann as follows""You deserve, my friend to be counted amongst the good landlordsWho are anxious to manage their house through qualified people.For I have often observed how cautiously men are accustom'dSheep and cattle and horses to watch, when buying or bart'ringBut a man, who's so useful, provided he's good and efficient,And who does so much harm and mischief by treacherous dealings,Him will people admit to their houses by chance and haphazard,And too late find reason to rue an o'erhasty decision.This you appear to understand, for a girl you have chosenAs your servant, and that of your parents, who thoroughly good is.Treat her well, and as long as she finds the business suit her,You will not miss your sister, your parents will miss not their daughter.""

ííííOther persons now enter'd, the patient's nearest relations,Many articles bringing, and better lodgings announcing.All were inform'd of the maiden's decision, and warmly bless'd Hermann,Both with significant looks, and also with grateful expressions,And one secretly whispered into the ear of another""If the master should turn to a bridegroom, her home is provided.""Hermann then presently took her hand, and address'd her as follows""Let us be going; the day is declining, and far off the village.""Then the women, with lively expressions, embraced Dorothea;Hermann drew her away; they still continued to greet her.Next the children, with screams and terrible crying attack'd her,Pulling her clothes, their second mother refusing to part from.But first one of the women, and then another rebuked them""Children, hush! to the town she is going, intending to bring youPlenty of gingerbread back, which your brother already had order'd,From the confectioner, when the stork was passing there lately,And she'll soon return, with papers prettily gilded.""

ííííSo at length the children released her; but scarcely could HermannTear her from their embraces and distant-signalling kerchiefs.-----VIII. MELPOMENE.

ííííHERMANN AND DOROTHEA.

ííííSo tow'rd the sun, now fast sinking to rest, the two walk'd together,Whilst he veil'd himself deep in clouds which thunder portended.Out-of his veil now here, now there, with fiery glancesBeaming over the plain with rays foreboding and lurid.""May this threatening weather,"" said Hermann, ""not bring to us shortlyHail and violent rain, for well does the harvest now promise.""And they both rejoiced in the corn so lofty and waving,Well nigh reaching the heads of the two tall figures that walk'd there.Then the maiden spoke to her friendly leader as follows""Generous youth, to whom I shall owe a kind destiny shortly,Shelter and home, when so many poor exiles must weather the tempest,In the first place tell me all about your good parents,Whom I intend to serve with all my soul from hence-forward;Knowing one's master, 'tis easier far to give satisfaction,By rememb'ring the things which he deems of the highest importance,And on which he has set his heart with the greatest decision.Tell me, then, how best I can win your father and mother.""

ííííThen the good and sensible youth made answer as follows""You are indeed quite right, my kind and excellent maiden,To begin by asking about the tastes of my parents!For I have hitherto striven in vain to satisfy Father,When I look'd after the inn, as well as my regular duty,Working early and late in the field, and tending the vineyard.Mother indeed was contented; she knew how to value my efforts;And she will certainly hold you to be an excellent maiden,If you take care of the house, as though the dwelling your own were.But my father's unlike her; he's fond of outward appearance.Gentle maiden, deem me not cold and void of all feeling,If I disclose my father's nature to you, who're a stranger.Yes, such words have never before escaped, I assure vonOut of my mouth, which is little accustom'd to babble and chatter;But you have managed to worm all my secrets from out of my bosom.Well, my worthy father the graces of life holds in honour,Wishes for outward signs of love, as well as of rev'rence,And would doubtless be satisfied with an inferior servantWho understood this fancy, and hate a better, who did not.""

ííííCheerfully she replied, with gentle movement increasingThrough the darkening path the speed at which she was walking:I in truth shall hope to satisfy both of your parents,For your mother's character my own nature resembles,And to external graces have I from my youth been accustom'd.Our old neighbours, the French, in their earlier days laid much stress onCourteous demeanour; 'twas common alike to nobles and burghers,And to peasants, and each enjoin'd it on all his acquaintance.in the same way, on the side of the Germans, the children were train'd upEvery morning, with plenty of kissing of hands and of curtsies,To salute their parents, and always to act with politeness.All that I have learnt, and all I have practised since childhood,All that comes from my heart,--I will practise it all with the old man.But on what terms shall I--I scarcely dare ask such a question,--Be with yourself, the only son, and hereafter my master?""

ííííThus she spoke, and at that moment they came to the peartree.Down from the skies the moon at her full was shining in glory;Night had arrived, and the last pale gleam of the sunset had vanish'd.So before them were lying, in masses all heap'd up together,Lights as clear as the day, and shadows of night and of darkness.And the friendly question was heard by Hermann with pleasure,Under the shade of the noble tree at the spot which he loved soWhich that day had witness'd his tears at the fate of the exile.And whilst they sat themselves down, to take a little repose there,Thus the loving youth spoke, whilst he seized the hand of the maiden""Let your heart give the answer, and always obey what it tells you!""But he ventured to say no more, however propitiousWas the moment; he feard that a No would be her sole answer,Ah! and he felt the ring on her finger, that sorrowful token.So by the side of each other they quietly sat and in silence,But the maiden began to speak, and said, ""How delightfulIs the light of the moon! The clearness of day it resembles.Yonder I see in the town the houses and courtyards quite plainly,In the gable a window; methinks all the panes I can reckon.""

íííí""That which you see,"" replied the youth, who spoke with an effort,""That is our house down to which I now am about to conduct you,And that window yonder belongs to my room in the attic,Which will probably soon be yours, as we're making great changes.All these fields are ours, and ripe for the harvest to-morrow;Here in the shade we are wont to rest, enjoying our meal-time.But let us now descend across the vineyard and garden,For observe how the threatening storm is hitherward rolling,Lightening first, and then eclipsing the beautiful full moon.""So the pair arose, and wauder'd down by the corn-field,

ííííThrough the powerful corn, in the nightly clearness rejoicing;And they reach'd the vineyard, and through its dark shadows proceeded.So he guided her down the numerous tiers of the flat stonesWhich, in an unhewn state, served as steps to the walk through the foliage.Slowly she descended, and placed her hands on his shoulders;And, with a quivering light, the moon through the foliage o'erlook'd them,Till by storm-clouds envelop'd, she left the couple in darkness.Then the strong youth supported the maiden, who on him was leaning;She, however, not knowing the path, or observing the rough steps,Slipp'd as she walk'd, her foot gave way, and she well nigh was falling.Hastily held out his arm the youth with nimbleness thoughtful,And held up his beloved one; she gently sank on his shoulders,Breast was press'd against breast, and cheek against cheek, and so stood heFix'd like a marble statue, restrained by a firm resolution;He embraced her no closer, thoughall her weight he supported;So he felt his noble burden, the warmth of her bosom,And her balmy breath, against his warm lips exhaling,Bearing with manly feelings the woman's heroical greatness.

ííííBut she conceal'd the pain which she felt, and jestingly spoke thus""It betokens misfortune,--so scrupulous people inform us,--For the foot to give way on entering a house, near the threshold.I should have wish'd, in truth, for a sign of some happier omen!Let us tarry a little, for fear your parents should blame youFor their limping servant, and you should be thought a bad landlord.""-----IX.  URANIA.

ííííCONCLUSION.

ííííO YE Muses, who gladly favour a love that is heartfelt,Who on his way the excellent youth have hitherto guided,Who have press'd the maid to his bosom before their betrothal,Help still further to perfect the bonds of a couple so loving,Drive away the clouds which over their happiness hover!But begin by saying what now in the house has been passing.

ííííFor the third time the mother impatiently enter'd the chamberWhere the men were sitting, which she had anxiously quitted,Speaking of the approaching storm, and the loss of the moon's light,Then of her son's long absence, and all the perils that night brings.Strongly she censured their friends for having so soon left the youngster,For not even addressing the maiden, or seeking to woo her.

íííí""Make not the worst of the mischief,"" the father peevishly answer'd;""For you see we are waiting ourselves, expecting the issue.""

ííííBut the neighbour sat still, and calmly address'd them as follows:--""In uneasy moments like these, I always feel gratefulTo my late father, who when I was young all seeds of impatienceIn my mind uprooted, and left no fragment remaining,And I learnt how to wait, as well as the best of the wise men.""Tell us what legerdemain he employ'd,"" the pastor made answer.""I will gladly inform you, and each one may gain by the lesson,""Answer'd the neighbour. ""When I was a boy, I was standing one SundayIn a state of impatience, eagerly waiting the carriageWhich was to carry us out to the fountain under the lime-trees;But it came not; I ran like a weasel now hither, now thither,Up and down the stairs, and from the door to the window;Both my hands were prickling, I scratch'd away at the tables,Stamping and trotting about, and scarcely refrain'd I from crying.All this the calm man composedly saw; but finally when ICarried my folly too far, by the arm he quietly took me,Led me up to the window, and used this significant language'See you up yonder the joiner's workshop, now closed for the Sunday?'Twill be re-open'd to-morrow, and plane and saw will be working.Thus will the busy hours be pass'd from morning till evening.But remember this: the rimming will soon be arriving,When the master, together with all his men, will be busyIn preparing and finishing quickly and deftly your coffin,And they will carefully bring over here that house made of boards, whichWill at length receive the patient as well as impatient,And which is destined to carry a roof that's unpleasantly heavy.All that he mention'd I forthwith saw taking place in my mind's eye,Saw the boards join'd together, and saw the black cover made ready,Patiently then I sat, and meekly awaited the carriage.And I always think of the coffin whenever I see menRunning about in a state of doubtful and wild expectation.""

ííííSmilingly answered the pastor:--""Death's stirring image is neitherUnto the wise a cause of alarm,--or an end to the pious.Back into life it urges the former, and teaches him action,And, for the weal of the latter, it strengthens his hope in affliction.Death is a giver of life unto both. Your father did wronglyWhen to the sensitive boy he pointed out death in its own form.Unto the youth should be shown the worth of a noble and ripen'dAge, and unto the old man, youth, that both may rejoice inThe eternal circle, and life may in life be made perfect!""

ííííHere the door was open'd. The handsome couple appear'd there,And the friends were amazed, the loving parents astonish'dAt the form of the bride, the form of the bridegroom resembling.Yes! the door appear'd too small to admit the tall figuresWhich now cross'd the threshold, in company walking together.To his parents Hermann presented her, hastily saying:--""Here is a maiden just of the sort you are wishing to have here,Welcome her kindly, dear father! she fully deserves it, and you too,Mother dear, ask her questions as to her housekeeping knowledge,That you may see how well she deserves to form one of our party.""Then he hastily took on one side the excellent pastor,Saying:--"" Kind sir, I entreat you to help me out of this troubleQuickly, and loosen the knot, whose unravelling I am so dreading;For I have not ventured to woo as my bride the fair maiden,But she believes she's to be a maid in the house, and I fear meShe will in anger depart, as soon as we talk about marriage.But it must be decided at once! no longer in errorShall she remain, and I no longer this doubt can put up with.Hasten and once more exhibit that wisdom we all hold in honour.""So the pastor forthwith turn'd round to the rest of the party,But the maiden's soul was, unhappily, troubled alreadyBy the talk of the father, who just had address'd her as follows,Speaking good humour'dly, and in accents pleasant and lively""Yes, I'm well satisfied, child! I joyfully see that my son hasJust as good taste as his father, who in his younger days show'd it,Always leading the fairest one out in the dance, and then lastlyTaking the fairest one home as his wife--'twas your dear little mother!For by the bride whom a man selects, we may easily gatherWhat kind of spirit his is, and whether he knows his own value.But you will surely need but a short time to form your decision,For I verily think he will find it full easy to follow.""Hermann but partially heard the words; the whole of his membersInwardly quivered, and all the circle were suddenly silent.

ííííBut the excellent maiden, by words of such irony wounded,(As she esteem'd them to be) and deeply distress'd in her spirit,Stood, while a passing flush from her cheeks as far as her neck wasSpreading, but she restrain'd herself, and collected her thoughts soon;Then to the old man she said, not fully concealing her sorrow""Truly I was not prepared by your son for such a reception,When he described his father's nature,--that excellent burgher,And I know I am standing before you, a person of culture,Who behaves himself wisely to all, in a suitable manner.But it would seem that you feel not pity enough for the poor thingWho has just cross'd your threshold, prepared to enter your serviceElse you would not seek to point out, with ridicule bitter,How far removed my lot from your son's and that of yourself is.True, with a little bundle, and poor, I have enter'd your dwelling,Which it is the owner's delight to furnish with all things.But I know myself well, and feel the whole situation.Is it generous thus to greet me with language so jeering,Which was well nigh expelled me the house, when just on the threshold?""

ííííHermann uneasily moved about, and signed to the pastorTo interpose without delay, and clear up the error.Quickly the wise man advanced to the spot, and witness'd the maiden'sSilent vexation and tearful eyes and scarce-restrain'd sorrow.Then his spirit advised him to solve not at once the confusion,But, on the contrary, prove the excited mind of the maiden.So, in words framed to try her, the pastor address'd her as follows:--""Surely, my foreign maiden, you did not fully consider,When you made up your mind to serve a stranger so quickly,What it really is to enter the house of a master;For a shake of the hand decides your fate for a twelvemonth,And a single word Yes to much endurance will bind you.But the worst part of the service is not the wearisome habits,Nor the bitter toil of the work, which seems never-ending;For the active freeman works hard as well as the servant.But to suffer the whims of the master, who blames you unjustly,Or who calls for this and for that, not knowing his own mind,And the mistress's violence, always so easily kindled,With the children's rough and supercilious bad manners,--This is indeed hard to bear, whilst still fulfilling your dutiesPromptly and actively, never becoming morose or ill-natured;Yet for such work you appear little fit, for already the father'sJokes have offended you deeply; yet nothing more commonly happensThan to tease a maiden about her liking a youngster.""Thus he spoke, and the maiden felt the weight of his language,And no more restrain'd herself; mightily all her emotionsShow'd themselves, her bosom heaved, and a deep sigh escaped her,And whilst shedding burning tears, she answer'd as follows:--""Ne'er does the clever man, who seeks to advise us in sorrow,Think how little his chilling words our hearts can deliverFrom the pangs which an unseen destiny fastens upon us.You are happy and merry. How then should a jest ever wound you?But the slightest touch gives torture to those who are suff'ring.Even dissimulation would nothing avail me at present.Let me at once disclose what later would deepen my sorrow,And consign me perchance to agony mute and consuming.Let me depart forthwith! No more in this house dare I linger;I must hence and away, and look once more for my poor friendsWhom I left in distress, when seeking to better my fortunes.This is my firm resolve; and now I may properly tell youThat which had else been buried for many a year in my bosom.Yes, the father's jest has wounded me deeply, I own it,Not that I'm proud and touchy, as ill becometh a servant,But because in truth in my heart a feeling has risenFor the youth, who to-day has fill'd the part of my Saviour.For when first in the road he left me, his image remain'd stillFirmly fix'd in my mind; and I thought of the fortunate maidenWhom, as his betroth'd one, he cherish'd perchance in his bosom.And when I found him again at the well, the sight of him charm'd meJust as if I had-seen an angel descending from heaven.And I follow'd him willingly, when as a servant he sought me,But by my heart in truth I was flatter'd (I need must confess it),As I hitherward came, that I might possibly win him,If I became in the house an indispensable pillar.But, alas, I now see the dangers I well nigh fell into,When I bethought me of living so near a silently-loved one.Now for the first time I feel how far removed a poor maidenIs from a richer youth, however clever she may be.I have told you all this, that you my heart may mistake not,Which an event that in thought I foreshadow has wounded already.For I must have expected, my secret wishes concealing,That, ere much time had elapsed, I should see him bringing his bride home.And how then could I have endured my hidden affliction!Happily I am warn'd in time, and out of my bosomHas my secret escaped, whilst curable still is the evil.But no more of the subject! I now must tarry no longerIn this house, where I now am standing in pain and confusion,All my foolish hopes and my feelings freely confessing.Not the night which, with sinking clouds, is spreading around us,Not the rolling thunder (I hear it already) shall stop me,Not the falling rain, which outside is descending in torrents,Not the blustering storm. All this I had to encounterIn that sorrowful flight, while the enemy follow'd behind Us.And once more I go on my way, as I long have been wont to,Seized by the whirlpool of time, and parted from all that I care for.So farewell! I'll tarry no longer. My fate is accomplish'd!""

ííííThus she spoke, and towards the door she hastily turn'd her,Holding under her arm the bundle she brought when arriving.But the mother seized by both of her arms the fair maiden,Clasping her round the body, and cried with surprise and amazement""Say, what signifies this? These fruitless tears, what denote they?No, I'll not leave you alone! You're surely my dear son's betroth'd one!""But the father stood still, and show'd a great deal of reluctance,Stared at the weeping girl, and peevishly spoke then as follows""This, then, is all the indulgence my friends are willing to give me,That at the close of the day the most unpleasant thing happens!For there is nothing I hate so much as the tears of a woman,And their passionate cries, set up with such heat and excitement,Which a little plain sense would show to be utterly needless.Truly, I find the sight of these whimsical doings a nuisance.Matters must shift for themselves; as for me, I think it is bed-time.""So he quickly turn'd round, and hasten'd to go to the chamberWhere the marriage-bed stood, in which he slept for the most part.But his son held him back, and spoke in words of entreaty""Father, don't go in a hurry, and be not amniote with the maiden!I alone have to bear the blame of all this confusion,Which our friend has increased by his unexpected dissembling.Speak then, honour'd Sir! for to you the affair I confided;Heap not up pain and annoyance, but rather complete the whole matter;For I surely in future should not respect you so highly,If you play practical jokes, instead of displaying true wisdom.""

ííííThereupon the worthy pastor smilingly answer'd""What kind of wisdom could have extracted the charming confessionOf this good maiden, and so have reveal'd all her character to us?Is not your care converted at once to pleasure and rapture?Speak out, then, for yourself! Why need explanations from othersHermann then stepped forward, and gently address'd her as follows""Do not repent of your tears, nor yet of your passing affliction;For they perfect my happiness; yours too, I fain would consider.I came not to the fountain, to hire so noble a maidenAs a servant, I came to seek to win you affections.But, alas! my timid gaze had not strength to discoverYour heart's leanings; it saw in your eye but a friendly expression,When you greeted it out of the tranquil fountain's bright mirror.Merely to bring you home, made half of my happiness certainBut you now make it complete! May every blessing be yours, then!""Then the maiden look'd on the youth with heartfelt emotion,And avoided not kiss or embrace, the summit of rapture,When they also are to the loving the long-wish'd-for pledgesOf approaching bliss in a life which now seems to them endless.Then the pastor told the others the whole of the story;But the maiden came and gracefully bent o'er the father,Kissing the while his hand, which he to draw back attempted.And she said:--"" I am sure that you will forgive the surprised one,First for her tears of sorrow, and then for her tears of true rapture.O forgive the emotions by which they both have been prompted,And let me fully enjoy the bliss that has now been vouchsafed me!Let the first vexation, which my confusion gave rise to,Also be the last! The loving service which latelyWas by the servant promised, shall now by the daughter be render'd.""

ííííAnd the father, his tears concealing, straightway embraced her;Lovingly came the mother in turn, and heartily kiss'd her,Warmly shaking her hand; and silently wept they together.Then in a hasty manner, the good and sensible pastorSeized the hand of the father, his wedding-ring off from his fingerDrawing (not easily though; so plump was the member that held it)Then he took the mother's ring, and betroth'd the two children,Saying:--""Once more may it be these golden hoops' destinationFirmly to fasten a bond altogether resembling the old one!For this youth is deeply imbued with love for the maiden,And the maiden confesses that she for the youth has a liking.Therefore, I now betroth you, and wish you all blessings hereafter,With the parents' consent, and with our friend here as a witness.""

ííííAnd the neighbour bent forward, and added his own benediction;But when the clergyman placed the gold ring on the hand of the maiden,He with astonishment saw the one which already was on it,And which Hermann before at the fountain had anxiously noticed.Whereupon he spoke in words at once friendly and jesting""What! You are twice engaging yourself? I hope that the first oneMay not appear at the altar, unkindly forbidding the banns there!""

ííííBut she said in reply:--""O let me devote but one momentTo this mournful remembrance! For well did the good youth deserve it,Who, when departing, presented the ring, but never return'd home.All was by him foreseen, when freedom's love of a sudden,And a desire to play his part in the new-found Existence,Drove him to go to Paris, where prison and death were his portion.'Farewell,' said he, 'I go; for all things on earth are in motionAt this moment, and all things appear in a state of disunion.Fundamental laws in the steadiest countries are loosen'd,And possessions are parted from those who used to possess them,Friends are parted from friends, and love is parted from love too.I now leave you here, and whether I ever shall see youHere again,--who can tell? Perchance these words will our last be.Man is a stranger here upon earth, the proverb informs us;Every person has now become more a stranger than ever.Ours the soil is no longer; our treasures are fast flying from us;All the sacred old vessels of gold and silver are melted,All is moving, as though the old-fashion'd world would roll backwardsInto chaos and night, in order anew to be fashion'd.You of my heart have possession, and if we shall ever here-afterMeet again over the wreck of the world, it will be as new creatures,All remodell'd and free and independent of fortune;For what fetters can bind down those who survive such a period!But if we are destined not to escape from these dangers,If we are never again to embrace each other with rapturesO then fondly keep in your thoughts my hovering image,That you may be prepared with like courage for good and ill fortune!If a new home or a new alliance should chance to allure you,Then enjoy with thanks whatever your destiny offers,Purely loving the loving, and grateful to him who thus loves you.But remember always to tread with a circumspect footstep,For the fresh pangs of a second loss will behind you be lurking.Deem each day as sacred; but value not life any higherThan any other possession, for all possessions are fleeting.'Thus he spoke; and the noble youth and I parted for ever:Meanwhile I ev'rything lost, and a thousand times thought of his warning.Once more I think of his words, now that love is sweetly preparingHappiness for me anew, and the brightest of hopes is unfolding.Pardon me, dearest friend, for trembling e'en at the momentWhen I am clasping your arm! For thus, on first landing, the sailorFancies that even the solid ground is shaking beneath him.""

ííííThus she spoke, and she placed the rings by the side of each other.But the bridegroom answer'd, with noble and manly emotion""All the firmer, amidst the universal disruption,Be, Dorothea, our union! We'll show ourselves bold and enduring,Firmly hold our own, and firmly retain our possessions.For the man who in wav'ring times is inclined to be wav'ringOnly increases the evil, and spreads it wider and wider;But the man of firm decision the universe fashions.'Tis not becoming the Germans to further this fearful commotion,And in addition to waver uncertainly hither and thither.'This is our own!' we ought to say, and so to maintain it!For the world will ever applaud those resolute nationsWho for God and the Law, their wives, and parents, and childrenStruggle, and fall when contending against the foeman together.You are mine; and now what is mine, is mine more than ever.Not with anxiety will I preserve it, or timidly use it,But with courage and strength. And if the enemy threatenNow or hereafter, I'll hold myself ready, and reach down my weapons.If I know that the house and my parents by you are protected,I shall expose my breast to the enemy, void of all terror;And if all others thought thus, then might against might should be measured,And in the early prospect of peace we should all be rejoicing.""

íííí1796?.-----WEST-EASTERN DIVAN.-----Who the song would understand,Needs must seek the song's own land.Who the minstrel understand,Needs must seek the minstrel's land.-----

ííííTHE Poems comprised in this collection are written in thePersian style, and are greatly admired by Oriental scholars, forthe truthfulness with which the Eastern spirit of poetry isreproduced by the Western minstrel. They were chiefly composedbetween the years 1814 and 1819, and first given to the world inthe latter year. Of the twelve books into which they are divided,that of Suleika will probably be considered the best, from themany graceful love-songs which it contains. The following isHanoi's account of the Divan, and may well serve as a substitutefor anything I could say respecting it:--

ííííIt contains opinions and sentiments on the East, expressed in aseries of rich cantos and stanzas full of sweetness and spirit,and all this as enchanting as a harem emitting the most deliciousand rare perfumes, and blooming with exquisitely-lovely nymphswith eyebrows painted black, eyes piercing as those of theantelope, arms white as alabaster, and of the most graceful andperfectly-formed shapes, while the heart of the reader beats andgrows faint, as did that of the happy Gaspard Debaran, the clown,who, when on the highest step of his ladder, was enabled to peepinto the Seraglio of Constantinople--that recess concealed fromthe inspection of man. Sometimes also the reader may imaginehimself indolently stretched on a carpet of Persian softness,luxuriously smoking the yellow tobacco of Turkistan through along tube of jessamine and amber, while a black slave fans himwith a fan of peacock's feathers, and a little boy presents himwith a cup of genuine Mocha. Goethe has put these enchanting andvoluptuous customs into poetry, and his verses are so perfect, soharmonious, so tasteful, so soft, that it seems really surprisingthat he should ever have been able to have brought the Germanlanguage to this state of suppleness. The charm of the book isinexplicable; it is a votive nosegay sent from the West to theEast, composed of the most precious and curious plants: redroses, hortensias like the breast of a spotless maiden, purpledigitalis like the long finger of a man, fantastically formedranunculi, and in the midst of all, silent and tastefullyconcealed, a tuft of German violets. This nosegay signifies thatthe West is tired of thin and icy-cold spirituality, and seekswarmth in the strong and healthy bosom of the East.""

ííííSo the winter now closed round themWith resistless fury. ScatteringOver all his breath so icy,He inflamed each wind that blitheTo assail them angrily.Over them he gave dominionTo his frost-unsharpened tempests;Down to Timur's council went he,And with threat'ning voice address'd him:--""Softly, slowly, wretched being!Live, the tyrant of injustice;But shall hearts be scorch'd much longerBy thy flames,--consume before them?If amongst the evil spiritsThou art one,--good! I'm another.Thou a greybeard art--so I am;Land and men we make to stiffen.Thou art Mars! And I Saturnus,--Both are evil-working planets,When united, horror-fraught.Thou dost kill the soul, thou freezesE'en the atmosphere; still colderIs my breath than thine was ever.Thy wild armies vex the faithfulWith a thousand varying torments;Well! God grant that I discoverEven worse, before I perish!And by God, I'll give thee none.Let God hear what now I tell thee!Yes, by God! from Death's cold clutchesNought, O greybeard, shall protect thee,Not the hearth's broad coalfire's ardour,Not December's brightest flame.""

ííííWhose sweet fragrance aye may live,Slender as thy finger e'en,

ííííMust a world its treasures give;

ííííYes, a world where life is moving,

ííííWhich, with impulse full and strong,Could forbode the Bulbul's loving,

ííííSweet, and spirit-stirring song.

ííííSince they thus have swell'd our joy,

ííííMyriad souls of living men?

ííííONCE, methought, in the night hours cold,

ííííThat I saw the moon in my sleep;But as soon as I waken'd, behold

ííííUnawares rose the sun from the deep.

ííííTHAT Suleika's love was so strong

ííííFor Joseph, need cause no surprise;

ííííHe was young, youth pleaseth the eyes,--

ííííHe was fair, they say, beyond measure

ííííFair was she, and so great was their pleasure.But that thou, who awaitedst me long,Youthful glances of fire dost throw me,Soon wilt bless me, thy love now dost show me,This shall my joyous numbers proclaim,Thee I for ever Suleika shall name.

íííí1815.-----HATEM.

ííííNOT occasion makes the thief;

ííííShe's the greatest of the whole;For Love's relics, to my grief,

ííííFrom my aching heart she stole.

ííííShe hath given it to thee,--

ííííAll the joy my life had known,So that, in my poverty,

ííííLife I seek from thee alone.

ííííYet compassion greets me straight

ííííIn the lustre of thine eye,And I bless my newborn fate,

ííííAs within thine arms I lie.

íííí1815.-----SULEIKA.

ííííTHE sun appears! A glorious sight!

ííííThe crescent-moon clings round him now.What could this wondrous pair unite?

ííííHow to explain this riddle? How?

ííííHATEM.

ííííMay this our joy's foreboder prove!

ííííIn it I view myself and thee;Thou calmest me thy sun, my love,--

ííííCome, my sweet moon, cling thou round me!

íííí1815.-----LOVE for love, and moments sweet,

ííííLips returning kiss for kiss,Word for word, and eyes that meet;

ííííBreath for breath, and bliss for bliss.Thus at eve, and thus the morrow!

ííííYet thou feeblest, at my lay,Ever some half-hidden sorrow;Could I Joseph's graces borrow,

ííííAll thy beauty I'd repay!

íííí1815.-----HATEM.

ííííO, SAY, 'neath what celestial sign

ííííThe day doth lie,When ne'er again this heart of mine

ííííAway will fly?And e'en though fled (what thought divine!)

ííííWould near me lie?--On the soft couch, on whose sweet shrine

ííííMy heart near hers will lie!

íííí1816.-----HATEM.

ííííHOLD me, locks, securely caught

ííííIn the circle of her face!Dear brown serpents, I have nought

ííííTo repay this act of grace,

ííííSave a heart whose love ne'er dies,

ííííThrobbing with aye-youthful glow;For a raging ETA lies

íííí'Neath its veil of mist and snow.

ííííYonder mountain's stately brow

ííííThou, like morning beams, dost shame;Once again feels Hatem now

ííííSpring's soft breath and summer's flame.

ííííAND wherefore sends notThe horseman-captainHis heralds hither

ííííEach day, unfailing?Yet hath he horses,He writes well.

ííííHe waiteth Tali,And Neski knows heTo write with beautyOn silken tablets.I'd deem him present,Had I his words.

ííííThe sick One will not,Will not recoverFrom her sweet sorrow;She, when she hearethThat her true loverGrows well, falls sick.

ííííWRITES he in Neski,Faithfully speaks he;Writes he in Tali,Joy to give, seeks he:Writes he in either,Good!--for he loves!

íííí1819.*-----THESE tufted branches fair

ííííObserve, my loved one, well!And see the fruits they bear

ííííIn green and prickly shell!

ííííThey've hung roll'd up, till now,

ííííUnconsciously and still;A loosely-waving bough

ííííDoth rock them at its will.

ííííYet, ripening from within.

ííííThe kernel brown swells fast;It seeks the air to win,

ííííIt seeks the sun at last.

ííííWith joy it bursts its thrall,

ííííThe shell must needs give way.'Tis thus my numbers fall

ííííBefore thy feet, each day.

íííí1815.-----SULEIKA.

ííííWHAT is by this stir reveal'd?

ííííDoth the East glad tidings bring?For my heart's deep wounds are heal'd

ííííBy his mild and cooling wing.

ííííHe the dust with sports doth meet,

ííííAnd in gentle cloudlets chase;To the vineleaf's safe retreat

ííííDrives the insects' happy race,

ííííCools these burning cheeks of mine,

ííííChecks the sun's fierce glow Adam,Kisses, as he flies, the vine,

ííííFlaunting over hill and plain.

ííííAnd his whispers soft convey

ííííThousand greetings from my friend;Ere these hills own night's dark sway,

ííííKisses greet me, without end.

ííííThus canst thou still onward go,

ííííServing friend and mourner too!There, where lofty ramparts glow,

ííííSoon the loved one shall I view.

ííííAh, what makes the heart's truth known,--

ííííLove's sweet breath,--a newborn life,--Learn I from his mouth alone,

ííííIn his breath alone is rife!

íííí1815.-----THE SUBLIME TYPE.

ííííTHE sun, whom Grecians Helms call,

ííííHis heavenly path with pride doth tread,And, to subdue the world's wide all,

ííííLooks round, beneath him, high o'er head.

ííííHe sees the fairest goddess pine,

ííííHeaven's child, the daughter of the clouds,--For her alone he seems to shine;

ííííIn trembling grief his form he shrouds,

ííííCareless for all the realms of bliss,--

ííííHer streaming tears more swiftly flow:For every pearl he gives a kiss,

ííííAnd changeth into joy her woe.

ííííShe gazeth upward fixedly,

ííííAnd deeply feels his glance of might,While, stamped with his own effigy,

ííííEach pearl would range itself aright.

ííííThus wreath'd with bows, with hues thus grac'd,

ííííWith gladness beams her face so fair,While he, to meet her, maketh haste,

ííííAnd yet, alas! can reach her ne'er.

ííííSo, by the harsh decree of Fate,

ííííThou modest from me, dearest one;And were I Helms e'en, the Great,

ííííWhat would avail his chariot-throne?

íííí1815.-----SULEIKA.

ííííZEPHYR, for thy humid wing,

ííííOh, how much I envy thee!Thou to him canst tidings bring

ííííHow our parting saddens me!

ííííIn my breast, a yearning still

ííííAs thy pinions wave, appears;Flow'rs and eyes, and wood, and hill

ííííAt thy breath are steeped in tears.

ííííYet thy mild wing gives relief,

ííííSoothes the aching eyelid's pain;Ah, I else had died for grief,

ííííHim ne'er hoped to see again.

ííííTo my love, then, quick repair,

ííííWhisper softly to his heart;Yet, to give him pain, beware,

ííííNor my bosom's pangs impart.

ííííTell him, but in accents coy,

ííííThat his love must be my life;Both, with feelings fraught with joy,

ííííIn his presence will be rife.

íííí1815.-----THE REUNION.

ííííCAN it be! of stars the star,

ííííDo I press thee to my heart?In the night of distance far,

ííííWhat deep gulf, what bitter smart!Yes, 'tis thou, indeed, at last,

ííííOf my joys the partner dear!Mindful, though, of sorrows past,

ííííI the present needs must fear.

ííííWhen the still-unfashion'd earth

ííííLay on God's eternal breast,He ordain'd its hour of birth,

ííííWith creative joy possess'd.Then a heavy sigh arose,

ííííWhen He spake the sentence:--""Be!""And the All, with mighty throes,

ííííBurst into reality.

ííííAnd when thus was born the light,

ííííDarkness near it fear'd to stay,And the elements with might

ííííFled on every side away;Each on some far-distant trace,

ííííEach with visions wild employ,Numb, in boundless realm of space,

ííííHarmony and feeling-void.

ííííDumb was all, all still and dead,

ííííFor the first time, God alone!Then He form'd the morning-red,

ííííWhich soon made its kindness known:It unravelled from the waste,

ííííBright and glowing harmony,And once more with love was grac'd

ííííWhat contended formerly.

ííííAnd with earnest, noble strife,

ííííEach its own Peculiar sought;Back to full, unbounded life

ííííSight and feeling soon were brought.Wherefore, if 'tis done, explore

ííííHow? why give the manner, name?Allah need create no more,

ííííWe his world ourselves can frame.

ííííSo, with morning pinions bright,

ííííTo thy mouth was I impell'd;Stamped with thousand seals by night,

ííííStar-clear is the bond fast held.Paragons on earth are we

ííííBoth of grief and joy sublime,And a second sentence:--""Be!""

ííííParts us not a second time.

íííí1815.-----SULEIKA.

ííííWITH what inward joy, sweet lay,

ííííI thy meaning have descried!Lovingly thou seem'st to say

ííííThat I'm ever by his side;

ííííThat he ever thinks of me,

ííííThat he to the absent givesAll his love's sweet ecstasy,

ííííWhile for him alone she lives.

ííííYes, the mirror which reveals

ííííThee, my loved one, is my breast;This the bosom, where thy seals

ííííEndless kisses have impress'd.

ííííNumbers sweet, unsullied truth,

ííííChain me down in sympathy!Love's embodied radiant youth,

ííííIn the garb of poesy!

ííííYet, all-beloved-one, straight know I thee;Thou mayst with magic veils thy face disguise,

ííííAnd yet, all-present-one, straight know I thee.

ííííUpon the cypress' purest, youthful bud,

ííííAll-beauteous-growing-one, straight know I thee;In the canal's unsullied, living flood,

ííííAll-captivating-one, well know I thee.

ííííWhen spreads the water-column, rising proud,

ííííAll-sportive one, how gladly know I thee;When, e'en in forming, is transform'd the cloud,

ííííAll-figure-changing-one, there know I thee.

ííííVeil in the meadow-carpet's flowery charms,

ííííAll-checkered-starry-fair-one, know I thee;And if a plant extend its thousand arms,

ííííO, all-embracing-one, there know I thee.

ííííWhen on the mount is kindled morn's sweet light,

ííííStraightway, all-gladdening-one, salute I thee,The arch of heaven o'er head grows pure and bright,--

ííííAll-heart-expanding-one, then breathe I thee.

ííííThat which my inward, outward sense proclaims,

ííííThou all-instructing-one, I know through thee;And if I utter Allah's hundred names,

ííííA name with each one echoes, meant for thee.

ííííAll night-time make me stray;For, oh! 'tis Love's sweet drunkenness

ííííTHE BEQUEST OF THE ANCIENT PERSIAN FAITH.

ííííBRETHREN, what bequest to you should comeFrom the lowly poor man, going home,Whom ye younger ones with patience tended,Whose last days ye honour'd and defended?

ííííWhen we oft have seen the monarch ride,Gold upon him, gold on ev'ry side;Jewels on him, on his courtiers all,Thickly strewed as hailstones when they fall,

ííííHave ye e'er known envy at the sight?And not felt your gaze become more bright,When the sun was, on the wings of morning,Darnawend's unnumber'd peaks adorning,

ííííAs he, bow-like, rose? How each eye dweltOn the glorious scene! I felt, I felt,Thousand times, as life's days fleeted by,Borne with him, the coming one, on high.

ííííGod upon His throne then to proclaim,Him, the life-fount's mighty Lord, to name,Worthily to prize that glorious sight,And to wander on beneath His light.

ííííWhen the fiery orb was all defined,There I stood, as though in darkness, blind,Beat my breast, my quicken'd members threwOn the earth, brow-foremost, at the view.

ííííLet this holy, great bequest rewardBrotherly good-will and kind regard:SOLEMN DUTY'S DAILY observation.--More than this, it needs no revelation.

ííííIf its gentle hands a new-born oneMove, then straightway turn it tow'rd the sun,--Soul and body dip in bath of fire!Then each morning's favour 'twill acquire.

ííííTo the living one, commit the dead,O'er the beast let earth and dust be spread,And, so far as may extend your might,What ye deem impure, conceal from sight.

ííííTill your plains to graceful purity,That the sun with joy your labours see;When ye plant, your trees in rows contrive,For he makes the Regular to thrive.

ííííE'en the floods that through the channel rushMust not fail in fulness or in gush;And as Senderud, from mountain high,Rises pure, in pureness must it die.

ííííNot to weaken water's gentle fall,Carefully cleanse out the channels all;Salamander, snake, and rush, and reed,--All destroy,--each monster and each weed.

ííííIf thus pure ye earth and water keep,Through the air the sun will gladly peep,Where he, worthily enshrined in space,Worketh life, to life gives holy grace.

ííííYe, by toil on toil so sorely tried,Comfort take, the All is purified;And now man, as priest, may boldly dareFrom the stone God's image to prepare.

ííííWhen the flame burns joyously and bright,Limbs are supple, radiant is the night;On the hearth when fire with ardour glows,Ripe the sap of plants and creatures grows.

ííííDragging wood, with rapture be it done,'Tis the seed of many an earthly sun;Plucking Pambeh, gladly may ye say:--This, as wick, the Holy will convey.

ííííIf ye meekly, in each burning lamp,See the nobler light's resplendent stamp,Ne'er will Fate prevent you, void of feeling,At God's throne at morningtide from kneeling.

ííííThis is Being's mighty signet, then,God's pure glass to angels and to men;Each word lisped the Highest's praise to sound,Ring in ring, united there is found.

ííííFrom the shore of Senderud ascendeth,Up to Darnawend its pinions bendeth,As He dawns, with joy to greet His light,You with endless blessings to requite.

The victoryremained with Mahomet, who lost fourteen men, while seventy ofthe enemy were slain. A great accession of strength ensued inconsequence to the Prophet, who pretended that miracles werewrought in his behalf in the battle, God having sent angels tofight on his side, and having also made his army to appear largerto the enemy than it really was.--See the Koran, chapter viii.,and ABULFEDA'S Life of Mahomet.]

ííííShall a god drink, eat at table,Like us mortals? No, the Only,Who the sun and moon created,And the glowing stars arch'd o'er us,He is God,--we'll fly!""--The gentle,Lightly shod, and dainty striplingsDid a shepherd meet, and hide them,With himself, within a cavern.

ííííAnd the sheep-dog will not leave them,--Scared away, his foot all-mangled,To his master still he presses,And he joins the hidden party,Joins the favorites of slumber.

ííííAnd the prince, whom they had fled from,Fondly-furious, thinks of vengeance,And, discarding sword and fire,Has them walled-up in the cavern,Walled-up fast with bricks and mortar.

ííííBut the others slumber ever,And the Angel, their protector,Gives before God's throne this notice""To the right and left alternateHave I ever cared to turn them,That their fair and youthful membersBe not by the mould-damp injured;Clefts within the rocks I open'd,That the sun may, rising, setting,Keep their cheeks in youthful freshness.""So they lie there, bless'd by Heaven.And, with forepaws sound and scatheless,Sleeps the dog in gentle slumber.

ííííYears come round, and years fly onward,And the youths at length awaken,And the wall, which now had moldered,From its very age has fallen.And Jamblika says,--whose beautyFar exceedeth all the others,--When the fearful shepherd lingers:--""I will run, and food procure you,Life and piece of gold I'll wager!""--Ephebus had many a year nowOwn'd the teaching of the ProphetJesus (Peace be with the Good One!)

ííííAnd he ran, and at the gatewayWere the warders and the others.Yet he to the nearest baker's,Seeking bread, went swiftly onwards.--""Rogue!"" thus cried the baker--""hast thou,Youth, a treasure, then, discover'd?Give me,--for the gold betrays thee,--Give me half, to keep thy secret!""--

ííííAs of ancestors, he hears them,Speaking of his son and grandsons.His great-grandsons stand around him,Like a race of valiant mortals,Him to honour,--him, the youngest.And one token on anotherRises up, the proof completing;The identity is provenOf himself, and of his comrades.

ííííNow returns he to the cavern,With him go both king and people.--Neither to the king nor peopleE'er returns that chosen mortal;For the Seven, who for ages--Eight was, with the dog, their number--Had from all the world been sunder'd,Gabriel's mysterious power,To the will of God obedient,Hath to Paradise conducted,--And the cave was closed for ever.

ííííSONGS FROM VARIOUS PLAYS, ETC

íííí-----FROM FAUST.

ííííI.DEDICATION.

ííííYE shadowy forms, again ye're drawing near,

ííííSo wont of yore to meet my troubled gaze!Were it in vain to seek to keep you here?

ííííLoves still my heart that dream of olden days?Oh, come then! and in pristine force appear,

ííííParting the vapor mist that round me plays!My bosom finds its youthful strength again,Feeling the magic breeze that marks your train.

ííííYe bring the forms of happy days of yore,

ííííAnd many a shadow loved attends you too;Like some old lay, whose dream was well nigh o'er,

ííííFirst-love appears again, and friendship true;Upon life's labyrinthine path once more

ííííIs heard the sigh, and grief revives anew;The friends are told, who, in their hour of pride,Deceived by fortune, vanish'd from my side.

ííííNo longer do they hear my plaintive song,

ííííThe souls to whom I sang in life's young day;Scatter'd for ever now the friendly throng,

ííííAnd mute, alas! each sweet responsive lay.My strains but to the careless crowd belong,

ííííTheir smiles but sorrow to my heart convey;And all who heard my numbers erst with gladness,If living yet, roam o'er the earth in sadness.

ííííLong buried yearnings in my breast arise,

ííííYon calm and solemn spirit-realm to gain;Like the AEONIAN harp's sweet melodies,

ííííMy murmuring song breathes forth its changeful strain.A trembling seizes me, tears fill mine eyes,

ííííAnd softer grows my rugged heart amain.All I possess far distant seems to be,The vanish'd only seems reality.

ííííII.PROLOGUE IN HEAVEN.

ííííTHE ARCHANGELS' SONG.

ííííRAPHAEL.

ííííTHE sun still chaunts, as in old time,

ííííWith brother-spheres in choral song,And with his thunder-march sublime

ííííMoves his predestined course along.Strength find the angels in his sight,

ííííThough he by none may fathomed be;Still glorious is each work of might

ííííAs when first form'd in majesty.

ííííGABRIEL.

ííííAnd swift and swift, in wondrous guise,

ííííRevolves the earth in splendour bright,The radiant hues of Paradise

ííííAlternating with deepest night.From out the gulf against the rock,

ííííIn spreading billows foams the ocean,--And cliff and sea with mighty shock,

ííííThe spheres whirl round in endless motion.

ííííMICHAEL.

ííííAnd storms in emulation growl

ííííFrom land to sea, from sea to land,And fashion, as they wildly howl,

ííííA circling, wonder-working band.Destructive flames in mad career

ííííPrecede Thy thunders on their way;Yet, Lord, Thy messengers revere

ííííThe soft mutations of Thy day.

ííííTHE THREE.

ííííStrength find the angels in Thy sight,

ííííThough none may hope to fathom Thee;Still glorious are Thy works of might,

ííííAs when first form'd in majesty.

ííííIII.CHORUS OF ANGELS.

ííííCHRIST is arisen!

ííííMortal, all hail!Thou, of Earth's prison

ííííDreary and frail,Bursting the veil,

ííííProudly hast risen!

ííííCHORUS OF WOMEN.

ííííRich spices and myrrh,

ííííTo embalm Him we brought;His corpse to inter

ííííHis true followers sought.In pure cerements shrin'd,

íííí'Twas placed in the bierBut, alas! we now find

ííííThat Christ is not here.

ííííCHORUS OF ANGELS.

ííííChrist is arisen!

ííííSpeechless His love.Who to Earth's prison

ííííCame from above,Trials to prove.

ííííNow is He risen!

ííííCHORUS OF YOUTHS.

ííííDeath's gloomy portal

ííííNow hath He rended,--Living, immortal,

ííííHeavenward ascended;Freed from His anguish,

ííííSees He God's throne;We still must languish,

ííííEarthbound, alone.Now that He's reft us,

ííííHeart-sad we pine;Why hast Thou left us,

ííííMaster divine?

ííííCHORUS OF ANGELS.

ííííChrist is arisen,

ííííDeath hath He slain;

ííííBurst ye your prison,

ííííRend ye each chain!

ííííSongs of praise lead ye,--

ííííLove to show, heed ye,--

ííííHungry ones feed ye,--

ííííPreaching, on speed ye,--

ííííComing joys plead ye,--Then is the Master near,Then is He here!

ííííIV.CHORUS OF SPIRITS.

ííííVANISH, dark clouds on high,

ííííOffspring of night!Let a more radiant beamThrough the blue ether gleam,

ííííCharming the sight!Would the dark clouds on high

ííííMelt into air!Stars glimmer tenderly,

ííííPlanets more fair

ííííShed their soft light.Spirits of heav'nly birth,Fairer than sons of earth,Quivering emotions true

ííííHover above;Yearning affections, too,

ííííIn their train move.See how the spirit-band,By the soft breezes fann'd,Covers the smiling land,--Covers the leafy grove,Where happy lovers rove,Deep in a dream of love,True love that never dies!Bowers on bowers rise,

ííííSoft tendrils twine;While from the press escapes,Born of the juicy grapes,

ííííFoaming, the wine;And as the current flowsO'er the bright stones it goes,--Leaving the hilly lands

ííííFar, far behind,--Into a sea expands,

ííííLoving to windRound the green mountain's base;And the glad-winged race,

ííííRapture sip in,As they the sunny light,And the fair islands bright,

ííííHasten to win,That on the billows playWith sweet deceptive ray,Where in glad choral songShout the exulting throng;Where on the verdant plain

ííííDancers we see,Spreading themselves amain

ííííOver the lea.Some boldly climbing are

ííííO'er the steep brake,Others are floating far

ííííO'er the smooth lake.All for a purpose move,

ííííAll with life teem,While the sweet stars above

ííííBlissfully gleam.

ííííV.MARGARET AT HER SPINNING-WHEEL.

ííííMY heart is sad,

ííííMy peace is o'er;I find it never

ííííAnd nevermore.

ííííWhen gone is he,The grave I see;The world's wide allIs turned to gall.

ííííAlas, my head

ííííIs well-nigh crazed;My feeble mind

ííííIs sore amazed.

ííííMy heart is sad,

ííííMy peace is o'er;I find it never

ííííAnd nevermore.

ííííFor him from the window

ííííAlone I spy;For him alone

ííííFrom home go I.

ííííHis lofty step,

ííííHis noble form,His mouth's sweet smile,

ííííHis glances warm,

ííííHis voice so fraught

ííííWith magic bliss,His hand's soft pressure,

ííííAnd, ah, his kiss!

ííííMy heart is sad,

ííííMy peace is o'er;I find it never

ííííAnd nevermore.

ííííMy bosom yearns

ííííFor his form so fair;Ah, could I clasp him

ííííAnd hold him there!

ííííMy kisses sweet

ííííShould stop his breath,And 'neath his kisses

ííííI'd sink in death!

ííííVI.SCENE--A GARDEN,

ííííMargaret. Faust.

ííííMARGARET.

ííííDOST thou believe in God?

ííííFAUST.

ííííDoth mortal live

ííííWho dares to say that he believes in God?Go, bid the priest a truthful answer give,

ííííGo, ask the wisest who on earth e'er trod,--Their answer will appear to beGiven alone in mockery.

ííííMARGARET.

ííííThen thou dost not believe? This sayest thou?

ííííFAUST.

ííííSweet love, mistake not what I utter now!Who knows His name?Who dares proclaim:--Him I believe?Who so can feelHis heart to steelTo sari believe Him not?The All-Embracer,The All-Sustained,Holds and sustains He notThee, me, Himself?

ííííHang not the heavens their arch overhead?Lies not the earth beneath us, firm?Gleam not with kindly glancesEternal stars on high?Looks not mine eye deep into thine?And do not all thingsCrowd on thy head and heart,And round thee twine, in mystery eterne,Invisible, yet visible?Fill, then, thy heart, however vast, with this,And when the feeling perfecteth thy bliss,O, call it what thou wilt,Call it joy! heart! love! God!No name for it I know!'Tis feeling all--nought else;Name is but sound and smoke,Obscuring heaven's bright glow.

ííííVII.MARGARET, Placing fresh flowers in the flower-pots.

ííííO THOU well-tried in grief,

ííííGrant to thy child relief,And view with mercy this unhappy one!

ííííThe sword within thy heart,

ííííSpeechless with bitter smart,Thou Lookest up towards thy dying son.

ííííThou look'st to God on high,

ííííAnd breathest many a sighO'er his and thy distress, thou holy One!

ííííWho e'er can know

ííííThe depth of woe

ííííPiercing my very bone?The sorrows that my bosom fill,Its trembling, its aye-yearning will,

ííííAre known to thee, to thee alone!

ííííWherever I may go,

ííííWith woe, with woe, with woe,My bosom sad is aching!

ííííI scarce alone can creep,

ííííI weep, I weep, I weep,My very heart is breaking.

ííííThe flowers at my window

ííííMy falling tears bedewed,When I, at dawn of morning,

ííííFor thee these flow'rets strewed.

ííííWhen early to my chamber

ííííThe cheerful sunbeams stole,I sat upon my pallet,

ííííIn agony of soul.

ííííHelp! rescue me from death and misery!

ííííOh, thou well-tried in grief,

ííííGrant to thy child relief,And view with mercy my deep agony!

ííííFROM FAUST--SECOND PART.

ííííI.

ííííARIEL.

ííííWHEN in spring the gentle rain

ííííBreathes into the flower new birth,When the green and happy plain

ííííSmiles upon the sons of earth,Haste to give what help we may,

ííííLittle elves of wondrous might!Whether good or evil they,

ííííPity for them feels the sprite.

ííííII.CHORUS OF SPIRITS.

ííííWHEN the moist and balmy gale

ííííRound the verdant meadow sighs,Odors sweet in misty veil

ííííAt the twilight-hour arise.Murmurings soft of calm repose

ííííRock the heart to child-like rest,And the day's bright portals close

ííííOn the eyes with toil oppress'd.

ííííNight already reigns o'er all,

ííííStrangely star is link'd to star;Planets mighty, sparkling small,

ííííGlitter near and gleam afar.Gleam above in clearer night,

ííííGlitter in the glassy sea;Pledging pure and calm delight,

ííííRules the moon in majesty.

ííííNow each well-known hour is over,

ííííJoy and grief have pass'd away;Feel betimes! thoult then recover:

ííííTrust the newborn eye of day.Vales grow verdant, hillocks teem,

ííííShady nooks the bushes yield,And with waving, silvery gleam,

ííííRocks the harvest in the field.

ííííWouldst thou wish for wish obtain,

ííííLook upon yon glittering ray!Lightly on thee lies the chain,

ííííCast the shell of sleep away!Tarry not, but be thou bold,

ííííWhen the many loiter still;All with ease may be controll'd

ííííBy the man of daring will.

ííííIII.ARIEL.

ííííHARK! the storm of hours draws near,Loudly to the spirit-earSigns of coming day appear.Rocky gates are wildly crashing,Phoebus' wheels are onward dashing;

íííí(A wonderful noise proclaims the approach of the sun.)

ííííLight doth mighty sounds beget!Pealing loud as rolling thunder,Eye and ear it fills with wonder,

ííííThough itself unconscious yet.Downward steals it,'mongst the flowersSeeking deeper, stiller bowers,'Mongst the foliage, 'neath the rock;Thou'lt be deafened by the shock!-----FROM FAUST--SECOND PART.

ííííSCENE THE LAST.

ííííANGELS.[Hovering in the higher regions of air, and hearing the immortalpart of Faust.]

ííííTHE spirit-region's noble limb

ííííHath 'scaled the Archfiend's power;For we have strength to rescue him

ííííWho labours ev'ry hour.And if he feels within his breast

ííííA ray of love from heaven.He's met by all the squadron blest

ííííWith welcome gladly given.

ííííTHE YOUNGER ANGELS.

ííííYonder roses, from the holyHands of penitents so lowly,Help'd to render us victorious,And to do the deed all-glorious;For they gain'd us this soul-treasure.

ííííEvil ones those roses banish'd,

ííííDevils, when we met them, vanish'd.Spirits felt love's pangs with pleasure,Where hell's torments used to dwell;E'en the hoary king of hellFelt sharp torments through him run.Shout for joy! the prize is won.

ííííTHE MORE PERFECT ANGELS.

ííííStrains of mortality

ííííLong have oppress'd us;Pure could they ever be,

ííííIf of asbestos.If mighty spirit-strength

ííííElements everKnew how to seize at length,

ííííAngels could neverLink'd twofold natures move,

ííííWhere single-hearted;By nought but deathless love

ííííCan they be parted.

ííííTHE YOUNGER ANGELS.

ííííSee where a spirit-race

ííííBursts on the sight!Dimly their forms I trace

ííííRound the far height.Each cloud becometh clear,While the bright troops appear

ííííOf the blest boys,

ííííFrom the Earth's burden free,In a glad company

ííííDrinking in joys,Born of the world above,

ííííSpringtime and bliss.May they forerunners proveOf a more perfect love,

ííííLink'd on to this!

ííííTHE BEATIFIED CHILDREN.

ííííThus as a chrysalis

ííííGladly we gain him,And as a pledge of bliss

ííííSafely retain him;When from the shell he's free

ííííWhereby he's tainted,Perfect and fair he'll be,

ííííHoly and sainted.

ííííDOCTOR MARINAS.(In the highest, purest cell.)

ííííWide is the prospect here,

ííííRaised is the soul;Women on high appear,

ííííSeeking their goal.

íííí'Mongat them the radiant one,

ííííQueen of the skies,In her bright starry crown

ííííGreets my glad eyes.

íííí(With ecstasy.)

ííííThou who art of earth the queen.

ííííLet me, 'neath the blueHeav'nly canopy serene

ííííThy sweet mystery view!Grant the gentle solemn force

ííííWhich the breast can move.And direct our onward course

ííííTow'rd thy perfect love.Dauntless let our courage be,

ííííAt thy bright behest;Mild our ardour suddenly,

ííííWhen thou bidd'st us rest.Virgin, type of holiness,

ííííMother, honour-crown'd,Thou whom we as queen confess,

ííííGodlike and renowned.

ííííRound her, in gentle play,

ííííLight clouds are stealing;Penitents fair are they,

ííííWho, humbly kneeling,Sip in the ether sweet,As they for grace entreat.

ííííThou, who art from passions free,

ííííKindly art inclin'd,When the sons of frailty

ííííSeek thee, meek in mind.

ííííBorne by weakness' stream along,

ííííHard it is to save them;Who can burst lust's chains so strong,

ííííThat, alas, enslave them?O how soon the foot may slip,

ííííWhen the smooth ground pressing!O, how false are eye and lip,

ííííFalse a breath caressing!

ííííMATER GLORLOSA hovers past.

ííííCHORUS OF PENITENT WOMEN.

ííííTo bring realms on high

ííííIn majesty soaring,O, hark to our cry

ííííThy pity imploring,Thou help to the cheerless,In glory so peerless!

ííííMAGNA PECCATRIX (St. Luke vii. 36).

ííííBy the love, which o'er the feet

ííííOf thy God-transfigur'd SonDropp'd the team, like balsam sweet,

ííííSpite of ev'ry scornful one;By the box of ointment rare,

ííííWhence the drops so fragrant fell;By the locks, whose gentle care

ííííDried His holy members well--

íííímuller SAMARITANA (St, John iv.).

ííííBy the well where Abram erst

ííííDrove his flocks to drink their fill;By the bucket which the thirst

ííííOf the Saviour served to still;By the fountain, balm-exhaling,

ííííThat from yon bright region flows,Ever clear and never failing.

ííííAs round ev'ry world it goes--

ííííMARIA AEGYPTIACA (Acta Sanctorum).

ííííBy the sacred spot immortal,

ííííWhere the Lord's remains they plac'd;By the arm, that from the portal

ííííDrove me back with warning haste;By my forty years of lowly

ííííPenance in a desert land;By the farewell greetings holy

ííííThat I wrote upon the sand--

ííííTHE THREE.

ííííThou who ne'er thy radiant face

ííííFrom the greatest sinners hides,Thou who Thine atoning grace

ííííThrough eternity provident,

ííííLet this soul, by virtue stirr'd,

ííííSelf-forgetful though when living,That perceived not that it err'd,

ííííFeel thy mercy, sin forgiving!

ííííUNA POENITENTIUM.(Once named Margaret, pressing near them.)

ííííOh radiance-spreading One,

ííííWho equall'd art by none,In mercy view mine ecstasy!

ííííFor he whom erst I loved,

ííííNo more by sorrow proved,Returns at length to me!

ííííBEATIFIED CHILDREN.(Approaching as they hover round.)

ííííHe now in strength of limb

ííííFar doth outweigh us,And, as we tended him,

ííííSo will repay us.Early removed were we

ííííFar from life's story;Train'd now himself, will he

ííííTrain us in glory.

ííííTHE PENITENT, once named Margaret.

ííííLink'd with the noble band of spirits,

ííííScarce can the new one feel or seeThe radiant life he now inherits,

ííííSo like that holy band is he.See how he bursts each bond material,

ííííAnd parts the olden veil at length,--In vesture clad of grace ethereal,

ííííComes in the glow of youthful strength.Oh, let me guide his steps victorious,

ííííWhile dazzled by the new-born light.

ííííMATER GLORIOSA.

ííííCome! raise thyself to spheres more glorious,He'll follow when thou matzoth his sight.

ííííDOCTOR MARINAS.(Prostrated in adoration.)

ííííO repentant sinful ones,

ííííOn that bright face gaze ye,And, in grateful orisons,

ííííYour blest fortune praise ye!Be each virtue of the mind

ííííTo thy service given!Virgin, mother, be thou kind!

ííííGoddess, queen of heaven!

ííííCHORUS MYSTICS.

ííííEach thing of mortal birth

ííííIs but a typeWhat was of feeble worth

ííííHere becomes ripe.What was a mystery

ííííHere meets the eye;The ever-womanly

ííííDraws us on high.

íííí(Finis.)-----FROM IPHIGENIA IN TAURIS.

ííííACT IV. SCENE 5.

ííííSONG OF THE FATES.

ííííYE children of mortalsThe deities dread!The mastery hold theyIn hands all-eternal,And use them, unquestioned,What manner they like.

ííííLet him fear them doubly,Whom they have uplifted!On cliffs and on clouds, oh,Round tables all-golden,he seats are made ready.

ííííWhen rises contention,The guests are humid downwardsWith shame and dishonorTo deep depths of midnight,And vainly await they,Bound fast in the darkness,A just condemnation.

ííííBut they remain everIn firmness unshakenRound tables all-golden.On stride they from mountainTo mountain far distant:From out the abysses'Dark jaws, the breath risesOf torment-choked TitansUp tow'rds them, like incenseIn light clouds ascending.

ííííThe rulers immortalAvert from whole peoplesTheir blessing-fraught glances,And shun, in the children,To trace the once cherish'd,Still, eloquent featuresTheir ancestors wore.

ííííThus chanted the Parae;The old man, the banish'd,In gloomy vault lying,Their song overheareth,Sons, grandsons remembereth,And shaketh his head.-----FROM GOTZ VON BERLICHINGEN.

ííííACT II.

ííííLIEBETRAUT plays and sings.

ííííHIS bow and dart bearing,And torch brightly flaring,

ííííDan Cupid on flies;With victory laden,To vanquish each maiden

ííííHe roguishly tries.

ííííUp! up!

ííííOn! on!His arms rattle loudly,His wings rustle proudly,And flames fill his eyes.

ííííThen finds he each bosom

ííííDefenseless and bare;They gladly receive him

ííííAnd welcome him there.The point of his arrows

ííííHe lights in the glow;They clasp him and kiss him

ííííAnd fondle him so.He e o! Pap!

ííííFROM EGMONT.

ííííACT I.

ííííCLARA winds a skein, and sings with Brackenburg.

ííííTHE drum gives the signal!

ííííLoud rings the shrill fife!My love leads his troops on

ííííFull arm'd for the strife,While his hand grasps his lanceAs they proudly advance.

ííííMy bosom pants wildly!My blood hotly flows!Oh had I a doublet,A helmet, and hose!

ííííThrough the gate with bold footstep

ííííI after him hied,--Each province, each country

ííííExplored by his side.The coward foe trembledThen rattled our shot:What bliss e'er resembled

ííííA soldier's glad lot!

ííííACT III.

ííííCLARA sings.

ííííGladness

ííííAnd sadnessAnd pensiveness blending

ííííYearning

ííííAnd burningIn torment ne'er ending;

ííííSad unto death,Proudly soaring above;

ííííHappy aloneIs the soul that doth love!

ííííFROM ""WILHELM MEISTER'S APPRENTICESHIP.""

ííííBOOK II., CHAP. XIII.

ííííWHO never eat with tears his bread,

ííííWho never through night's heavy hoursSat weeping on his lonely bed,--

ííííHe knows you not, ye heavenly powers!

ííííThrough you the paths of life we gain,

ííííYe let poor mortals go astray,And then abandon them to pain,--

ííííE'en here the penalty we pay,-----WHO gives himself to solitude,

ííííSoon lonely will remain;Each lives, each loves in joyous mood,

ííííAnd leaves him to his pain.

ííííYes! leave me to my grief!Were solitude's relief

ííííE'er granted me,

ííííAlone I should not be.

ííííA lover steals, on footstep light,

ííííTo learn if his love's alone;Thus o'er me steals, by day and night,

ííííAnguish before unknown,Thus o'er me steals deep grief.Ah, when I find relief

ííííWithin the tomb so lonely,

ííííWill rest be met with only!-----BOOK IV., CHAP. XI.

ííííMy grief no mortals know,

ííííExcept the yearning!Alone, a prey to woe,

ííííAll pleasure spurning,Up tow'rds the sky I throw

ííííA gaze discerning.

ííííHe who my love can know

ííííSeems ne'er returning;With strange and fiery glow

ííííMy heart is burning.My grief no mortals know,

ííííExcept the yearning!-----BOOK V., CHAP. X.

ííííSING no more in mournful tones

ííííOf the loneliness of night;For 'tis made, ye beauteous ones,

ííííFor all social pleasures bright.

ííííAs of old to man a wife

ííííAs his better half was given,So the night is half our life,

ííííAnd the fairest under heaven.

ííííHow can ye enjoy the day,

ííííWhich obstructs our rapture's tide?Let it waste itself away;

ííííWorthless 'tis for aught beside.

ííííBut when in the darkling hours

ííííFrom the lamp soft rays are glowing,And from mouth to mouth sweet showers,

ííííNow of jest, now love, are flowing,--

ííííWhen the nimble, wanton boy,

ííííWho so wildly spends his days,Oft amid light sports with joy

ííííO'er some trifling gift delays,?

ííííWhen the nightingale is singing

ííííStrains the lover holds so dear,Though like sighs and wailings ringing

ííííIn the mournful captive's ear,--

ííííWith what heart-emotion blest

ííííDo ye hearken to the bell,Wont of safety and of rest

ííííWith twelve solemn strokes to tell!

ííííTherefore in each heavy hour,

ííííLet this precept fill your heart:O'er each day will sorrow loud,

ííííRapture ev'ry night impart.-----EPILOGUE TO SCHILLER'S ""SONG OF THE BELL.""

íííí[This fine piece, written originally in 1805, on Schiller'sdeath, was altered and recast by Goethe in 1815, on the occasionof the performance on the stage of the Song of the Bell. Hencethe allusion in the last verse.]

ííííTo this city joy reveal it!

ííííPeace as its first signal peal it!

íííí(Song of the Bell--concluding lines.)

ííííAND so it proved! The nation felt, ere long,

ííííThat peaceful signal, and, with blessings fraught,A new-born joy appear'd; in gladsome song

ííííTo hail the youthful princely pair we sought;While in a living, ever-swelling throng

ííííMingled the crowds from ev'ry region brought,And on the stage, in festal pomp array'dThe HOMAGE OF THE ARTS * we saw displayed.

íííí(* The title of a lyric piece composed by Schiller in honour ofthe marriage of the hereditary Prince of Weimar to the PrincessMaria of Russia, and performed in 1804.)

ííííWhen, lo! a fearful midnight sound I hear,

ííííThat with a dull and mournful echo rings.And can it be that of our friend so dear

ííííIt tells, to whom each wish so fondly clings?Shall death overcome a life that all revere?

ííííHow such a loss to all confusion brings!How such a parting we must ever rue!The world is weeping,--shall not we weep too?

ííííHe was our own! How social, yet how great

ííííSeem'd in the light of day his noble mind!How was his nature, pleasing yet sedate,

ííííNow for glad converse joyously incline,Then swiftly changing, spirit-fraught, elate,

ííííLife's plan with deep-felt meaning it design'd,Fruitful alike in counsel and in deed!This have we proved, this tasted, in our need.

ííííHe was our own! O may that thought so blest

ííííOvercome the voice of wailing and of woeHe might have sought the Lasting, safe at rest

ííííIn harbour, when the tempest ceased to blow.Meanwhile his mighty spirit onward press'd

ííííWhere goodness, beauty, truth, for ever grow;And in his rear, in shadowy outline, layThe vulgar, which we all, alas, obey!

ííííNow doth he deck the garden-turret fair

ííííWhere the stars' language first illuded his soul,As secretly yet clearly through the air

ííííOn the eterne, the living sense it stole;And to his own, and our great profit, there

ííííExchangeth he the seasons as they roll;Thus nobly doth he vanquish, with renown,The twilight and the night that weigh us down.

ííííBrighter now glow'd his cheek, and still more bright.

ííííWith that unchanging, ever-youthful glow,--That courage which overcomes, in hard-fought fight,

ííííSooner or later, ev'ry earthly foe--That faith which, soaring to the realms of light,

ííííNow boldly Presseth on, now bendeth low,So that the good may work, wax, thrive amain,So that the day the noble may attain.

ííííYet, though so skill'd, of such transcendent worth,

ííííThis boarded scaffold doth he not despise;The fate that on its axis turns the earth

ííííFrom day to night, here shows he to our eyes,Raising, through many a work of glorious birth,

ííííArt and the artist's fame up tow'rd the skies.He fills with blossoms of the noblest strife,With life itself, this effigy of life.

ííííHis giant-step, as ye full surely knew,

ííííMeasured the circle of the will and deed,Each country's changing thoughts and morals too,

ííííThe darksome book with clearness could he read;Yet how he, breathless 'midst his friends so true,

ííííDespaired in sorrow, scarce from pain was freed,--All this have we, in sadly happy years,For he was ours, bewailed with feeling tears.

ííííWhen from the agonizing weight of grief

ííííHe raised his eyes upon the world again,We show'd him how his thoughts might find relief

ííííFrom the uncertain present's heavy chain,Gave his fresh-kindled mind a respite brief,

ííííWith kindly skill beguiling ev'ry pain,And e'en at eve, when setting was his sun,From his wan cheeks a gentle smile we won.

ííííFull early had he read the stern decree,

ííííSorrow and death to him, alas, were known;Ofttimes recovering, now departed he,--

ííííDread tidings, that our hearts had fear'd to own!Yet his transfigured being now can see

ííííItself, e'en here on earth, transfigured grown.What his own age reproved, and deem'd a crime,Hath been ennobled now by death and time.

ííííAnd many a soul that with him strove in fight,

ííííAnd his great merit grudged to recognise,Now feels the impress of his wondrous might,

ííííAnd in his magic fetters gladly lies;E'en to the highest bath he winged his flight,

ííííIn close communion link'd with all we prize.Extol him then! What mortals while they liveBut half receive, posterity shall give.

ííííThus is he left us, who so long ago,--

ííííTen years, alas, already!--turn'd from earth;We all, to our great joy, his precepts know,

ííííOh may the world confess their priceless worth!In swelling tide tow'rd every region flow

ííííThe thoughts that were his own peculiar birth;He gleams like some departing meteor bright,Combining, with his own, eternal light.-----

ííííL'ENVOl.

íííí-----Now, gentle reader, is our journey ended,

ííííMute is our minstrel, silent is our song;Sweet the bard's voice whose strains our course attended,

ííííPleasant the paths he guided us along.Now must we part,--Oh word all full of sadness,Changing to pensive retrospect our gladness!

ííííReader, farewell! we part perchance for ever,

ííííScarce may I hope to meet with thee again;But e'en though fate our fellowship may sever,

ííííReader, will aught to mark that tie remain?Yes! there is left one sad sweet bond of union,--Sorrow at parting links us in communion.

ííííBut of the twain, the greater is my sorrow,--

ííííReader, and why?--Bethink thee of the sun,How, when he sets, he waiteth for the morrow,

ííííProudly once more his giant-race to run,--Yet, e'en when set, a glow behind him leaving,Gladdening the spirit, which had else been grieving.

ííííThus mayst thou feel, for thou to GOETHE only

ííííBaldest farewell, nor camest aught for me.Twofold my parting, leaving me all lonely,--

ííííI now must part from GOETHE and from thee,Parting at once from comrade and from leader,--Farewell, great minstrel! farewell, gentle reader!

ííííHush'd is the harp, its music sunk in slumbers,Memory alone can waken now its numbers.

ííííby J.W. von Goethe

ííííTranslated by Thomas Carlyle and R.D. Boylan

ííííPREFACE

ííííI have carefully collected whatever I have been able to learn ofthe story of poor Werther, and here present it to you, knowingthat you will thank me for it.  To his spirit and character youcannot refuse your admiration and love: to his fate you will notdeny your tears.

ííííAnd thou, good soul, who sufferest the same distress as he enduredonce, draw comfort from his sorrows; and let this little book bethy friend, if, owing to fortune or through thine own fault, thoucanst not find a dearer companion.

ííííBOOK I

ííííMAY 4.

ííííHow happy I am that I am gone!  My dear friend, what a thing isthe heart of man!  To leave you, from whom I have been inseparable,whom I love so dearly, and yet to feel happy!  I know you willforgive me.  Have not other attachments been specially appointedby fate to torment a head like mine?  Poor Leonora! and yet I wasnot to blame.  Was it my fault, that, whilst the peculiar charmsof her sister afforded me an agreeable entertainment, a passionfor me was engendered in her feeble heart?  And yet am I whollyblameless?  Did I not encourage her emotions?  Did I not feelcharmed at those truly genuine expressions of nature, which, thoughbut little mirthful in reality, so often amused us?  Did I not --but oh! what is man, that he dares so to accuse himself?  My dearfriend I promise you I will improve; I will no longer, as has everbeen my habit, continue to ruminate on every petty vexation whichfortune may dispense; I will enjoy the present, and the past shallbe for me the past.  No doubt you are right, my best of friends,there would be far less suffering amongst mankind, if men -- andGod knows why they are so fashioned -- did not employ theirimaginations so assiduously in recalling the memory of past sorrow,instead of bearing their present lot with equanimity.  Be kindenough to inform my mother that I shall attend to her business tothe best of my ability, and shall give her the earliest informationabout it.  I have seen my aunt, and find that she is very far frombeing the disagreeable person our friends allege her to be.  Sheis a lively, cheerful woman, with the best of hearts.  I explainedto her my mother's wrongs with regard to that part of her portionwhich has been withheld from her.  She told me the motives andreasons of her own conduct, and the terms on which she is willingto give up the whole, and to do more than we have asked.  In short,I cannot write further upon this subject at present; only assuremy mother that all will go on well.  And I have again observed,my dear friend, in this trifling affair, that misunderstandingsand neglect occasion more mischief in the world than even maliceand wickedness.  At all events, the two latter are of less frequentoccurrence.

ííííIn other respects I am very well off here.  Solitude in thisterrestrial paradise is a genial balm to my mind, and the youngspring cheers with its bounteous promises my oftentimes misgivingheart.  Every tree, every bush, is full of flowers; and one mightwish himself transformed into a butterfly, to float about in thisocean of perfume, and find his whole existence in it.

ííííThe town itself is disagreeable; but then, all around, you find aninexpressible beauty of nature.  This induced the late Count M tolay out a garden on one of the sloping hills which here intersecteach other with the most charming variety, and form the most lovelyvalleys.  The garden is simple; and it is easy to perceive, evenupon your first entrance, that the plan was not designed by ascientific gardener, but by a man who wished to give himself uphere to the enjoyment of his own sensitive heart.  Many a tearhave I already shed to the memory of its departed master in asummer-house which is now reduced to ruins, but was his favouriteresort, and now is mine.  I shall soon be master of the place.The gardener has become attached to me within the last few days,and he will lose nothing thereby.

ííííMAY 10.

ííííA wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, likethese sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart.I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, whichwas created for the bliss of souls like mine.  I am so happy, mydear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquilexistence, that I neglect my talents.  I should be incapable ofdrawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel thatI never was a greater artist than now.  When, while the lovely valleyteems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the uppersurface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few straygleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among thetall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth,a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz ofthe little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countlessindescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presenceof the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath ofthat universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats aroundus in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness overspreadsmy eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb itspower, like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think withlonging, Oh, would I could describe these conceptions, could impressupon paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it mightbe the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infiniteGod!  O my friend -- but it is too much for my strength -- I sinkunder the weight of the splendour of these visions!

ííííMAY 12.

ííííI know not whether some deceitful spirits haunt this spot, orwhether it be the warm, celestial fancy in my own heart whichmakes everything around me seem like paradise.  In front of thehouse is a fountain, -- a fountain to which I am bound by a charmlike Melusina and her sisters.  Descending a gentle slope, you cometo an arch, where, some twenty steps lower down, water of theclearest crystal gushes from the marble rock.  The narrow wall whichencloses it above, the tall trees which encircle the spot, and thecoolness of the place itself, -- everything imparts a pleasant butsublime impression.  Not a day passes on which I do not spend anhour there.  The young maidens come from the town to fetch water,-- innocent and necessary employment, and formerly the occupation ofthe daughters of kings.  As I take my rest there, the idea of the oldpatriarchal life is awakened around me.  I see them, our old ancestors,how they formed their friendships and contracted alliances at thefountain-side; and I feel how fountains and streams were guarded bybeneficent spirits.  He who is a stranger to these sensations hasnever really enjoyed cool repose at the side of a fountain after thefatigue of a weary summer day.

ííííMAY 13.

ííííYou ask if you shall send me books.  My dear friend, I beseech you,for the love of God, relieve me from such a yoke!  I need no moreto be guided, agitated, heated.  My heart ferments sufficiently ofitself.  I want strains to lull me, and I find them to perfectionin my Homer.  Often do I strive to allay the burning fever of myblood; and you have never witnessed anything so unsteady, souncertain, as my heart.  But need I confess this to you, my dearfriend, who have so often endured the anguish of witnessing mysudden transitions from sorrow to immoderate joy, and from sweetmelancholy to violent passions?  I treat my poor heart like a sickchild, and gratify its every fancy.  Do not mention this again:there are people who would censure me for it.

ííííMAY 15.

ííííThe common people of the place know me already, and love me,particularly the children.  When at first I associated with them,and inquired in a friendly tone about their various trifles, somefancied that I wished to ridicule them, and turned from me inexceeding ill-humour.  I did not allow that circumstance to grieveme: I only felt most keenly what I have often before observed.Persons who can claim a certain rank keep themselves coldly alooffrom the common people, as though they feared to lose their importanceby the contact; whilst wanton idlers, and such as are prone to badjoking, affect to descend to their level, only to make the poorpeople feel their impertinence all the more keenly.

ííííI know very well that we are not all equal, nor can be so; but itis my opinion that he who avoids the common people, in order notto lose their respect, is as much to blame as a coward who hideshimself from his enemy because he fears defeat.

ííííThe other day I went to the fountain, and found a young servant-girl,who had set her pitcher on the lowest step, and looked around tosee if one of her companions was approaching to place it on herhead.  I ran down, and looked at her.  ""Shall I help you, prettylass?"" said I.  She blushed deeply.  ""Oh, sir!"" she exclaimed.""No ceremony!"" I replied.  She adjusted her head-gear, and Ihelped her.  She thanked me, and ascended the steps.

ííííMAY 17.

ííííI have made all sorts of acquaintances, but have as yet found nosociety.  I know not what attraction I possess for the people, somany of them like me, and attach themselves to me; and then I feelsorry when the road we pursue together goes only a short distance.If you inquire what the people are like here, I must answer, ""Thesame as everywhere.""  The human race is but a monotonous affair.Most of them labour the greater part of their time for meresubsistence; and the scanty portion of freedom which remains tothem so troubles them that they use every exertion to get rid ofit.  Oh, the destiny of man!

ííííBut they are a right good sort of people.  If I occasionally forgetmyself, and take part in the innocent pleasures which are not yetforbidden to the peasantry, and enjoy myself, for instance, withgenuine freedom and sincerity, round a well-covered table, orarrange an excursion or a dance opportunely, and so forth, allthis produces a good effect upon my disposition; only I must forgetthat there lie dormant within me so many other qualities whichmoulder uselessly, and which I am obliged to keep carefully concealed.Ah! this thought affects my spirits fearfully.  And yet to bemisunderstood is the fate of the like of us.

ííííAlas, that the friend of my youth is gone!  Alas, that I ever knewher!  I might say to myself, ""You are a dreamer to seek what isnot to be found here below.""  But she has been mine.  I havepossessed that heart, that noble soul, in whose presence I seemedto be more than I really was, because I was all that I could be.Good heavens! did then a single power of my soul remain unexercised?In her presence could I not display, to its full extent, thatmysterious feeling with which my heart embraces nature?  Was notour intercourse a perpetual web of the finest emotions, of thekeenest wit, the varieties of which, even in their very eccentricity,bore the stamp of genius?  Alas! the few years by which she wasmy senior brought her to the grave before me.  Never can I forgether firm mind or her heavenly patience.

ííííA few days ago I met a certain young V--, a frank, open fellow,with a most pleasing countenance.  He has just left the university,does not deem himself overwise, but believes he knows more thanother people.  He has worked hard, as I can perceive from manycircumstances, and, in short, possesses a large stock of information.When he heard that I am drawing a good deal, and that I know Greek(two wonderful things for this part of the country), he came tosee me, and displayed his whole store of learning, from Batteauxto Wood, from De Piles to Winkelmann: he assured me he had readthrough the first part of Sultzer's theory, and also possessed amanuscript of Heyne's work on the study of the antique.  I allowedit all to pass.

ííííI have become acquainted, also, with a very worthy person, thedistrict judge, a frank and open-hearted man.  I am told it is amost delightful thing to see him in the midst of his children, ofwhom he has nine.  His eldest daughter especially is highly spokenof.  He has invited me to go and see him, and I intend to do soon the first opportunity.  He lives at one of the royal hunting-lodges,which can be reached from here in an hour and a half by walking,and which he obtained leave to inhabit after the loss of his wife,as it is so painful to him to reside in town and at the court.

ííííThere have also come in my way a few other originals of a questionablesort, who are in all respects undesirable, and most intolerablein their demonstration of friendship.  Good-bye.  This letter willplease you: it is quite historical.

ííííMAY 22.

ííííThat the life of man is but a dream, many a man has surmisedheretofore; and I, too, am everywhere pursued by this feeling.When I consider the narrow limits within which our active andinquiring faculties are confined; when I see how all our energiesare wasted in providing for mere necessities, which again have nofurther end than to prolong a wretched existence; and then thatall our satisfaction concerning certain subjects of investigationends in nothing better than a passive resignation, whilst we amuseourselves painting our prison-walls with bright figures and brilliantlandscapes, -- when I consider all this, Wilhelm, I am silent.I examine my own being, and find there a world, but a world ratherof imagination and dim desires, than of distinctness and livingpower.  Then everything swims before my senses, and I smile anddream while pursuing my way through the world.

ííííAll learned professors and doctors are agreed that children do notcomprehend the cause of their desires; but that the grown-up shouldwander about this earth like children, without knowing whence theycome, or whither they go, influenced as little by fixed motives,but guided like them by biscuits, sugar-plums, and the rod, -- thisis what nobody is willing to acknowledge; and yet I think it ispalpable.

ííííI know what you will say in reply; for I am ready to admit thatthey are happiest, who, like children, amuse themselves with theirplaythings, dress and undress their dolls, and attentively watchthe cupboard, where mamma has locked up her sweet things, and,when at last they get a delicious morsel, eat it greedily, andexclaim, ""More!""  These are certainly happy beings; but othersalso are objects of envy, who dignify their paltry employments,and sometimes even their passions, with pompous titles, representingthem to mankind as gigantic achievements performed for their welfareand glory.  But the man who humbly acknowledges the vanity of allthis, who observes with what pleasure the thriving citizen convertshis little garden into a paradise, and how patiently even the poorman pursues his weary way under his burden, and how all wish equallyto behold the light of the sun a little longer, -- yes, such a manis at peace, and creates his own world within himself; and he isalso happy, because he is a man.  And then, however limited hissphere, he still preserves in his bosom the sweet feeling of liberty,and knows that he can quit his prison whenever he likes.

ííííMAY 26.

ííííYou know of old my ways of settling anywhere, of selecting a littlecottage in some cosy spot, and of putting up in it with everyinconvenience.  Here, too, I have discovered such a snug, comfortableplace, which possesses peculiar charms for me.

ííííAbout a league from the town is a place called Walheim.  (The readerneed not take the trouble to look for the place thus designated.We have found it necessary to change the names given in the original.)It is delightfully situated on the side of a hill; and, by proceedingalong one of the footpaths which lead out of the village, you canhave a view of the whole valley.  A good old woman lives there,who keeps a small inn.  She sells wine, beer, and coffee, and ischeerful and pleasant notwithstanding her age.  The chief charmof this spot consists in two linden-trees, spreading their enormousbranches over the little green before the church, which is entirelysurrounded by peasants' cottages, barns, and homesteads.  I haveseldom seen a place so retired and peaceable; and there often havemy table and chair brought out from the little inn, and drink mycoffee there, and read my Homer.  Accident brought me to the spotone fine afternoon, and I found it perfectly deserted.  Everybodywas in the fields except a little boy about four years of age, whowas sitting on the ground, and held between his knees a child aboutsix months old: he pressed it to his bosom with both arms, whichthus formed a sort of arm-chair; and, notwithstanding the livelinesswhich sparkled in its black eyes, it remained perfectly still.The sight charmed me.  I sat down upon a plough opposite, andsketched with great delight this little picture of brotherlytenderness.  I added the neighbouring hedge, the barn-door, andsome broken cart-wheels, just as they happened to lie; and I foundin about an hour that I had made a very correct and interestingdrawing, without putting in the slightest thing of my own.  Thisconfirmed me in my resolution of adhering, for the future, entirelyto nature.  She alone is inexhaustible, and capable of forming thegreatest masters.  Much may be alleged in favour of rules, as muchmay be likewise advanced in favour of the laws of society: anartist formed upon them will never produce anything absolutely bador disgusting; as a man who observes the laws, and obeys decorum,can never be an absolutely intolerable neighbour, nor a decidedvillain: but yet, say what you will of rules, they destroy thegenuine feeling of nature, as well as its true expression.  Do nottell me ""that this is too hard, that they only restrain and prunesuperfluous branches, etc.""  My good friend, I will illustratethis by an analogy.  These things resemble love.  A warmheartedyouth becomes strongly attached to a maiden: he spends every hourof the day in her company, wears out his health, and lavishes hisfortune, to afford continual proof that he is wholly devoted toher.  Then comes a man of the world, a man of place and respectability,and addresses him thus: ""My good young friend, love is natural;but you must love within bounds.  Divide your time: devote a portionto business, and give the hours of recreation to your mistress.Calculate your fortune; and out of the superfluity you may makeher a present, only not too often, -- on her birthday, and suchoccasions.""  Pursuing this advice, he may become a useful memberof society, and I should advise every prince to give him anappointment; but it is all up with his love, and with his geniusif he be an artist.  O my friend! why is it that the torrent ofgenius so seldom bursts forth, so seldom rolls in full-flowingstream, overwhelming your astounded soul?  Because, on either sideof this stream, cold and respectable persons have taken up theirabodes, and, forsooth, their summer-houses and tulip-beds wouldsuffer from the torrent; wherefore they dig trenches, and raiseembankments betimes, in order to avert the impending danger.

ííííMAY 27.

ííííI find I have fallen into raptures, declamation, and similes, andhave forgotten, in consequence, to tell you what became of thechildren.  Absorbed in my artistic contemplations, which I brieflydescribed in my letter of yesterday, I continued sitting on theplough for two hours.  Toward evening a young woman, with a basketon her arm, came running toward the children, who had not movedall that time.  She exclaimed from a distance, ""You are a goodboy, Philip!""  She gave me greeting: I returned it, rose, andapproached her.  I inquired if she were the mother of those prettychildren.  ""Yes,"" she said; and, giving the eldest a piece ofbread, she took the little one in her arms and kissed it with amother's tenderness.  ""I left my child in Philip's care,"" she said,""whilst I went into the town with my eldest boy to buy some wheatenbread, some sugar, and an earthen pot.""  I saw the various articlesin the basket, from which the cover had fallen.  ""I shall makesome broth to-night for my little Hans (which was the name of theyoungest): that wild fellow, the big one, broke my pot yesterday,whilst he was scrambling with Philip for what remained of thecontents.""   I inquired for the eldest; and she bad scarcely timeto tell me that he was driving a couple of geese home from themeadow, when he ran up, and handed Philip an osier-twig.  I talkeda little longer with the woman, and found that she was the daughterof the schoolmaster, and that her husband was gone on a journeyinto Switzerland for some money a relation had left him.  ""Theywanted to cheat him,"" she said, ""and would not answer his letters;so he is gone there himself.  I hope he has met with no accident,as I have heard nothing of him since his departure.""  I left thewoman, with regret, giving each of the children a kreutzer, withan additional one for the youngest, to buy some wheaten bread forhis broth when she went to town next; and so we parted.  I assureyou, my dear friend, when my thoughts are all in tumult, the sightof such a creature as this tranquillises my disturbed mind.  Shemoves in a happy thoughtlessness within the confined circle of herexistence; she supplies her wants from day to day; and, when shesees the leaves fall, they raise no other idea in her mind thanthat winter is approaching. Since that time I have gone out therefrequently.  The children have become quite familiar with me; andeach gets a lump of sugar when I drink my coffee, and they sharemy milk and bread and butter in the evening.  They always receivetheir kreutzer on Sundays, for the good woman has orders to giveit to them when I do not go there after evening service. They arequite at home with me, tell me everything; and I am particularlyamused with observing their tempers, and the simplicity of theirbehaviour, when some of the other village children are assembledwith them.

ííííIt has given me a deal of trouble to satisfy the anxiety of themother, lest (as she says) ""they should inconvenience the gentleman.""

ííííMAY 30.

ííííWhat I have lately said of painting is equally true with respectto poetry.  It is only necessary for us to know what is reallyexcellent, and venture to give it expression; and that is sayingmuch in few words.  To-day I have had a scene, which, if literallyrelated, would, make the most beautiful idyl in the world.  Butwhy should I talk of poetry and scenes and idyls?  Can we nevertake pleasure in nature without having recourse to art?

ííííIf you expect anything grand or magnificent from this introduction,you will be sadly mistaken.  It relates merely to a peasant-lad,who has excited in me the warmest interest.  As usual, I shalltell my story badly; and you, as usual, will think me extravagant.It is Walheim once more -- always Walheim -- which produces thesewonderful phenomena.

ííííA party had assembled outside the house under the linden-trees,to drink coffee.  The company did not exactly please me; and, underone pretext or another, I lingered behind.

ííííA peasant came from an adjoining house, and set to work arrangingsome part of the same plough which I had lately sketched.  Hisappearance pleased me; and I spoke to him, inquired about hiscircumstances, made his acquaintance, and, as is my wont withpersons of that class, was soon admitted into his confidence.  Hesaid he was in the service of a young widow, who set great storeby him.  He spoke so much of his mistress, and praised her soextravagantly, that I could soon see he was desperately in lovewith her.  ""She is no longer young,"" he said: ""and she was treatedso badly by her former husband that she does not mean to marryagain.""  From his account it was so evident what incomparablecharms she possessed for him, and how ardently he wished she wouldselect him to extinguish the recollection of her first husband'smisconduct, that I should have to repeat his own words in orderto describe the depth of the poor fellow's attachment, truth, anddevotion.  It would, in fact, require the gifts of a great poetto convey the expression of his features, the harmony of his voice,and the heavenly fire of his eye.  No words can portray thetenderness of his every movement and of every feature: no effortof mine could do justice to the scene.  His alarm lest I shouldmisconceive his position with regard to his mistress, or questionthe propriety of her conduct, touched me particularly.  The charmingmanner with which he described her form and person, which, withoutpossessing the graces of youth, won and attached him to her, isinexpressible, and must be left to the imagination.  I have neverin my life witnessed or fancied or conceived the possibility ofsuch intense devotion, such ardent affections, united with so muchpurity.  Do not blame me if I say that the recollection of thisinnocence and truth is deeply impressed upon my very soul; thatthis picture of fidelity and tenderness haunts me everywhere; andthat my own heart, as though enkindled by the flame, glows andburns within me.

ííííI mean now to try and see her as soon as I can: or perhaps, onsecond thoughts, I had better not; it is better I should beholdher through the eyes of her lover.  To my sight, perhaps, she wouldnot appear as she now stands before me; and why should I destroyso sweet a picture?

ííííJUNE 16.

íííí""Why do I not write to you?""  You lay claim to learning, and asksuch a question.  You should have guessed that I am well -- thatis to say -- in a word, I have made an acquaintance who has wonmy heart: I have -- I know not.

ííííTo give you a regular account of the manner in which I have becomeacquainted with the most amiable of women would be a difficult task.I am a happy and contented mortal, but a poor historian.

ííííAn angel!  Nonsense!  Everybody so describes his mistress; and yetI find it impossible to tell you how perfect she is, or why she isso perfect: suffice it to say she has captivated all my senses.

ííííSo much simplicity with so much understauding -- so mild, and yetso resolute -- a mind so placid, and a life so active.

ííííBut all this is ugly balderdash, which expresses not a singlecharacter nor feature.  Some other time -- but no, not some othertime, now, this very instant, will I tell you all about it.  Nowor never.  Well, between ourselves, since I commenced my letter,I have been three times on the point of throwing down my pen, ofordering my horse, and riding out.  And yet I vowed this morningthat I would not ride to-day, and yet every moment I am rushingto the window to see how high the sun is.

ííííI could not restrain myself -- go to her I must.  I have justreturned, Wilhelm; and whilst I am taking supper I will write toyou.  What a delight it was for my soul to see her in the midstof her dear, beautiful children, -- eight brothers and sisters!

ííííBut, if I proceed thus, you will be no wiser at the end of myletter than you were at the beginning.  Attend, then, and I willcompel myself to give you the details.

ííííI mentioned to you the other day that I had become acquainted withS--, the district judge, and that he had invited me to go and visithim in his retirement, or rather in his little kingdom.  But Ineglected going, and perhaps should never have gone, if chance hadnot discovered to me the treasure which lay concealed in thatretired spot.  Some of our young people had proposed giving a ballin the country, at which I consented to be present.  I offered myhand for the evening to a pretty and agreeable, but rather commonplace,sort of girl from the immediate neighbourhood; and it was agreedthat I should engage a carriage, and call upon Charlotte, with mypartner and her aunt, to convey them to the ball.  My companioninformed me, as we drove along through the park to the hunting-lodge,that I should make the acquaintance of a very charming young lady.""Take care,"" added the aunt, ""that you do not lose your heart.""""Why?"" said I.  ""Because she is already engaged to a very worthyman,"" she replied, ""who is gone to settle his affairs upon thedeath of his father, and will succeed to a very considerableinheritance.""  This information possessed no interest for me.When we arrived at the gate, the sun was setting behind the topsof the mountains.  The atmosphere was heavy; and the ladies expressedtheir fears of an approaching storm, as masses of low black cloudswere gathering in the horizon.  I relieved their anxieties bypretending to be weather-wise, although I myself had someapprehensions lest our pleasure should be interrupted.

ííííI alighted; and a maid came to the door, and requested us to waita moment for her mistress.  I walked across the court to a well-builthouse, and, ascending the flight of steps in front, opened the door,and saw before me the most charming spectacle I had ever witnessed.Six children, from eleven to two years old, were running about thehall, and surrounding a lady of middle height, with a lovely figure,dressed in a robe of simple white, trimmed with pink ribbons.  Shewas holding a rye loaf in her hand, and was cutting slices for thelittle ones all around, in proportion to their age and appetite.She performed her task in a graceful and affectionate manner; eachclaimant awaiting his turn with outstretched hands, and boisterouslyshouting his thanks.  Some of them ran away at once, to enjoy theirevening meal; whilst others, of a gentler disposition, retired tothe courtyard to see the strangers, and to survey the carriage inwhich their Charlotte was to drive away.  ""Pray forgive me forgiving you the trouble to come for me, and for keeping the ladieswaiting: but dressing, and arranging some household duties beforeI leave, had made me forget my children's supper; and they do notlike to take it from any one but me.""  I uttered some indifferentcompliment: but my whole soul was absorbed by her air, her voice,her manner; and I had scarcely recovered myself when she ran intoher room to fetch her gloves and fan.  The young ones threw inquiringglances at me from a distance; whilst I approached the youngest,a most delicious little creature.  He drew back; and Charlotte,entering at the very moment, said, ""Louis, shake hands with yourcousin.""  The little fellow obeyed willingly; and I could notresist giving him a hearty kiss, notwithstanding his rather dirtyface.  ""Cousin,"" said I to Charlotte, as I handed her down, ""doyou think I deserve the happiness of being related to you?""  Shereplied, with a ready smile, ""Oh! I have such a number of cousins,that I should be sorry if you were the most undeserving of them.""In taking leave, she desired her next sister, Sophy, a girl abouteleven years old, to take great care of the children, and to saygood-bye to papa for her when he came home from his ride.  Sheenjoined to the little ones to obey their sister Sophy as theywould herself, upon which some promised that they would; but alittle fair-haired girl, about six years old, looked discontented,and said, ""But Sophy is not you, Charlotte; and we like you best.""The two eldest boys had clambered up the carriage; and, at myrequest, she permitted them to accompany us a little way throughthe forest, upon their promising to sit very still, and hold fast.

ííííWe were hardly seated, and the ladies had scarcely exchangedcompliments, making the usual remarks upon each other's dress, andupon the company they expected to meet, when Charlotte stopped thecarriage, and made her brothers get down.  They insisted uponkissing her hands once more; which the eldest did with all thetenderness of a youth of fifteen, but the other in a lighter andmore careless manner.  She desired them again to give her love tothe children, and we drove off.

ííííThe aunt inquired of Charlotte whether she had finished the bookshe had last sent her.  ""No,"" said Charlotte; ""I did not like it:you can have it again.  And the one before was not much better.""I was surprised, upon asking the title, to hear that it was ____.(We feel obliged to suppress the passage in the letter, to preventany one from feeling aggrieved; although no author need pay muchattention to the opinion of a mere girl, or that of an unsteadyyoung man.)

ííííI found penetration and character in everything she said: everyexpression seemed to brighten her features with new charms, --withnew rays of genius, -- which unfolded by degrees, as she feltherself understood.

íííí""When I was younger,"" she observed, ""I loved nothing so much asromances.  Nothing could equal my delight when, on some holiday,I could settle down quietly in a corner, and enter with my wholeheart and soul into the joys or sorrows of some fictitious Leonora.I do not deny that they even possess some charms for me yet.  ButI read so seldom, that I prefer books suited exactly to my taste.And I like those authors best whose scenes describe my own situationin life, -- and the friends who are about me, whose stories touchme with interest, from resembling my own homely existence, -- which,without being absolutely paradise, is, on the whole, a source ofindescribable happiness.""

ííííI endeavoured to conceal the emotion which these words occasioned,but it was of slight avail; for, when she had expressed so trulyher opinion of ""The Vicar of Wakefield,"" and of other works, thenames of which I omit (Though the names are omitted, yet the authorsmentioned deserve Charlotte's approbation, and will feel it intheir hearts when they read this passage. It concerns no otherperson.), I could no longer contain myself, but gave full utteranceto what I thought of it: and it was not until Charlotte had addressedherself to the two other ladies, that I remembered their presence,and observed them sitting mute with astonishment.  The aunt lookedat me several times with an air of raillery, which, however, I didnot at all mind.

ííííWe talked of the pleasures of dancing. ""If it is a fault to loveit,"" said Charlotte, ""I am ready to confess that I prize it aboveall other amusements.  If anything disturbs me, I go to the piano,play an air to which I have danced, and all goes right againdirectly.""

ííííYou, who know me, can fancy how steadfastly I gazed upon her richdark eyes during these remarks, how my very soul gloated over herwarm lips and fresh, glowing cheeks, how I became quite lost inthe delightful meaning of her words, so much so, that I scarcelyheard the actual expressions.  In short, I alighted from thecarriage like a person in a dream, and was so lost to the dimworld around me, that I scarcely heard the music which resoundedfrom the illuminated ballroom.

ííííThe two Messrs. Andran and a certain N. N. (I cannot trouble myselfwith the names), who were the aunt's and Charlotte's partners,received us at the carriage-door, and took possession of theirladies, whilst I followed with mine.

ííííWe commenced with a minuet.  I led out one lady after another,and precisely those who were the most disagreeable could not bringthemselves to leave off.  Charlotte and her partner began an Englishcountry dance, and you must imagine my delight when it was theirturn to dance the figure with us.  You should see Charlotte dance.She dances with her whole heart and soul: her figure is all harmony,elegance, and grace, as if she were conscious of nothing else, andhad no other thought or feeling; and, doubtless, for the moment,every other sensation is extinct.

ííííShe was engaged for the second country dance, but promised me thethird, and assured me, with the most agreeable freedom, that shewas very fond of waltzing.  ""It is the custom here,"" she said,""for the previous partners to waltz together; but my partner isan indifferent waltzer, and will feel delighted if I save him thetrouble.  Your partner is not allowed to waltz, and, indeed, isequally incapable: but I observed during the country dance thatyou waltz well; so, if you will waltz with me, I beg you wouldpropose it to my partner, and I will propose it to yours.""  Weagreed, and it was arranged that our partners should mutuallyentertain each other.

ííííWe set off, and, at first, delighted ourselves with the usualgraceful motions of the arms.  With what grace, with what ease,she moved!  When the waltz commenced, and the dancers whirledaround each other in the giddy maze, there was some confusion,owing to the incapacity of some of the dancers.  We judiciouslyremained still, allowing the others to weary themselves; and, whenthe awkward dancers had withdrawn, we joined in, and kept it upfamously together with one other couple, -- Andran and his partner.Never did I dance more lightly.  I felt myself more than mortal,holding this loveliest of creatures in my arms, flying, with heras rapidly as the wind, till I lost sight of every other object;and O Wilhelm, I vowed at that moment, that a maiden whom I loved,or for whom I felt the slightest attachment, never, never shouldwaltz with any one else but with me, if I went to perdition for it!-- you will understand this.

ííííWe took a few turns in the room to recover our breath.  Charlottesat down, and felt refreshed by partaking of some oranges which Ihad had secured, -- the only ones that had been left; but at everyslice which, from politeness, she offered to her neighbours, I feltas though a dagger went through my heart.

ííííWe were the second couple in the third country dance.  As we weregoing down (and Heaven knows with what ecstasy I gazed at her armsand eyes, beaming with the sweetest feeling of pure and genuineenjoyment), we passed a lady whom I had noticed for her charmingexpression of countenance; although she was no longer young.  Shelooked at Charlotte with a smile, then, holding up her finger ina threatening attitude, repeated twice in a very significant toneof voice the name of ""Albert.""

íííí""Who is Albert,"" said I to Charlotte, ""if it is not impertinentto ask?""  She was about to answer, when we were obliged to separate,in order to execute a figure in the dance; and, as we crossed overagain in front of each other, I perceived she looked somewhatpensive.  ""Why need I conceal it from you?"" she said, as she gaveme her hand for the promenade.  ""Albert is a worthy man, to whomI am engaged.""  Now, there was nothing new to me in this (for thegirls had told me of it on the way); but it was so far new thatI had not thought of it in connection with her whom, in so shorta time, I had learned to prize so highly.  Enough, I became confused,got out in the figure, and occasioned general confusion; so thatit required all Charlotte's presence of mind to set me right bypulling and pushing me into my proper place.

ííííThe dance was not yet finished when the lightning which had forsome time been seen in the horizon, and which I had asserted toproceed entirely from heat, grew more violent; and the thunder washeard above the music.  When any distress or terror surprises usin the midst of our amusements, it naturally makes a deeper impressionthan at other times, either because the contrast makes us morekeenly susceptible, or rather perhaps because our senses are thenmore open to impressions, and the shock is consequently stronger.To this cause I must ascribe the fright and shrieks of the ladies.One sagaciously sat down in a corner with her back to the window,and held her fingers to her ears; a second knelt down before her,and hid her face in her lap; a third threw herself between them,and embraced her sister with a thousand tears; some insisted ongoing home; others, unconscious of their actions, wanted sufficientpresence of mind to repress the impertinence of their young partners,who sought to direct to themselves those sighs which the lips ofour agitated beauties intended for heaven.  Some of the gentlemenhad gone down-stairs to smoke a quiet cigar, and the rest of thecompany gladly embraced a happy suggestion of the hostess to retireinto another room which was provided with shutters and curtains.We had hardly got there, when Charlotte placed the chairs in acircle; and, when the company had sat down in compliance with herrequest, she forthwith proposed a round game.

ííííI noticed some of the company prepare their mouths and drawthemselves up at the prospect of some agreeable forfeit.  ""Let usplay at counting,"" said Charlotte.  ""Now, pay attention: I shallgo round the circle from right to left; and each person is to count,one after the other, the number that comes to him, and must countfast; whoever stops or mistakes is to have a box on the ear, andso on, till we have counted a thousand.""  It was delightful to seethe fun.  She went round the circle with upraised arm.  ""One,""said the first; ""two,"" the second; ""three,"" the third; and so on,till Charlotte went faster and faster.  One made a mistake, instantlya box on the ear; and, amid the laughter that ensued, came anotherbox; and so on, faster and faster.  I myself came in for two.  Ifancied they were harder than the rest, and felt quite delighted.A general laughter and confusion put an end to the game long beforewe had counted as far as a thousand.  The party broke up intolittle separate knots: the storm had ceased, and I followed Charlotteinto the ballroom.  On the way she said, ""The game banished theirfears of the storm.""  I could make no reply.  ""I myself,"" shecontinued, ""was as much frightened as any of them; but by affectingcourage, to keep up the spirits of the others, I forgot myapprehensions.""  We went to the window.  It was still thunderingat a distance: a soft rain was pouring down over the country,and filled the air around us with delicious odours.  Charlotteleaned forward on her arm; her eyes wandered over the scene; sheraised them to the sky, and then turned them upon me; they weremoistened with tears; she placed her hand on mine and said,""Klopstock!"" at once I remembered the magnificent ode which wasin her thoughts: I felt oppressed with the weight of my sensations,and sank under them.  It was more than I could bear.  I bent overher hand, kissed it in a stream of delicious tears, and againlooked up to her eyes.  Divine Klopstock! why didst thou not seethy apotheosis in those eyes?  And thy name so often profaned,would that I never heard it repeated!

ííííJUNE 19.

ííííI no longer remember where I stopped in my narrative: I only knowit was two in the morning when I went to bed; and if you had beenwith me, that I might have talked instead of writing to you, Ishould, in all probability, have kept you up till daylight.

ííííI think I have not yet related what happened as we rode home fromthe ball, nor have I time to tell you now.  It was a most magnificentsunrise: the whole country was refreshed, and the rain fell dropby drop from the trees in the forest.  Our companions were asleep.Charlotte asked me if I did not wish to sleep also, and begged ofme not to make any ceremony on her account.  Looking steadfastlyat her, I answered, ""As long as I see those eyes open, there isno fear of my falling asleep.""  We both continued awake till wereached her door.  The maid opened it softly, and assured her, inanswer to her inquiries, that her father and the children werewell, and still sleeping.  I left her asking permission to visither in the course of the day.  She consented, and I went, and,since that time, sun, moon, and stars may pursue their course: Iknow not whether it is day or night; the whole world is nothingto me.

ííííJUNE 21.

ííííMy days are as happy as those reserved by God for his elect; and,whatever be my fate hereafter, I can never say that I have nottasted joy, -- the purest joy of life.  You know Walheim.  I amnow completely settled there.  In that spot I am only half a leaguefrom Charlotte; and there I enjoy myself, and taste all the pleasurewhich can fall to the lot of man.

ííííLittle did I imagine, when I selected Walheim for my pedestrianexcursions, that all heaven lay so near it.  How often in mywanderings from the hillside or from the meadows across the river,have I beheld this hunting-lodge, which now contains within it allthe joy of my heart!

ííííI have often, my dear Wilhelm, reflected on the eagerness men feelto wander and make new discoveries, and upon that secret impulsewhich afterward inclines them to return to their narrow circle,conform to the laws of custom, and embarrass themselves no longerwith what passes around them.

ííííIt is so strange how, when I came here first, and gazed upon thatlovely valley from the hillside, I felt charmed with the entirescene surrounding me.  The little wood opposite -- how delightfulto sit under its shade!  How fine the view from that point ofrock!  Then, that delightful chain of hills, and the exquisitevalleys at their feet!  Could I but wander and lose myself amongstthem!  I went, and returned without finding what I wished.  Distance,my friend, is like futurity.  A dim vastness is spread before oursouls: the perceptions of our mind are as obscure as those of ourvision; and we desire earnestly to surrender up our whole being,that it may be filled with the complete and perfect bliss of oneglorious emotion.  But alas! when we have attained our object,when the distant there becomes the present here, all is changed:we are as poor and circumscribed as ever, and our souls stilllanguish for unattainable happiness.

ííííSo does the restless traveller pant for his native soil, and findin his own cottage, in the arms of his wife, in the affections ofhis children, and in the labour necessary for their support, thathappiness which he had sought in vain through the wide world.

ííííWhen, in the morning at sunrise, I go out to Walheim, and with myown hands gather in the garden the pease which are to serve formy dinner, when I sit down to shell them, and read my Homer duringthe intervals, and then, selecting a saucepan from the kitchen,fetch my own butter, put my mess on the fire, cover it up, and sitdown to stir it as occasion requires, I figure to myself theillustrious suitors of Penelope, killing, dressing, and preparingtheir own oxen and swine.  Nothing fills me with a more pure andgenuine sense of happiness than those traits of patriarchal lifewhich, thank Heaven! I can imitate without affectation.  Happy isit, indeed, for me that my heart is capable of feeling the samesimple and innocent pleasure as the peasant whose table is coveredwith food of his own rearing, and who not only enjoys his meal, butremembers with delight the happy days and sunny mornings when heplanted it, the soft evenings when he watered it, and the pleasurehe experienced in watching its daily growth.

ííííJUNE 29.

ííííThe day before yesterday, the physician came from the town to paya visit to the judge.  He found me on the floor playing withCharlotte's children.  Some of them were scrambling over me, andothers romped with me; and, as I caught and tickled them, theymade a great noise.  The doctor is a formal sort of personage: headjusts the plaits of his ruffles, and continually settles hisfrill whilst he is talking to you; and he thought my conduct beneaththe dignity of a sensible man.  I could perceive this by hiscountenance.  But I did not suffer myself to be disturbed.  Iallowed him to continue his wise conversation, whilst I rebuiltthe children's card houses for them as fast as they threw themdown.  He went about the town afterward, complaining that thejudge's children were spoiled enough before, but that now Wertherwas completely ruining them.

ííííYes, my dear Wilhelm, nothing on this earth affects my heart somuch as children.  When I look on at their doings; when I mark inthe little creatures the seeds of all those virtues and qualitieswhich they will one day find so indispensable; when I behold inthe obstinate all the future firmness and constancy of a noblecharacter; in the capricious, that levity and gaiety of temperwhich will carry them lightly over the dangers and troubles oflife, their whole nature simple and unpolluted, -- then I callto mind the golden words of the Great Teacher of mankind, ""Unlessye become like one of these!""  And now, my friend, these children,who are our equals, whom we ought to consider as our models, wetreat them as though they were our subjects.  They are allowed nowill of their own.  And have we, then, none ourselves? Whence comesour exclusive right?  Is it because we are older and more experienced?Great God! from the height of thy heaven thou beholdest greatchildren and little children, and no others; and thy Son has longsince declared which afford thee greatest pleasure.  But theybelieve in him, and hear him not, --that, too, is an old story;and they train their children after their own image, etc.

ííííAdieu, Wilhelm: I will not further bewilder myself with this subject.

ííííJULY 1.

ííííThe consolation Charlotte can bring to an invalid I experiencefrom my own heart, which suffers more from her absence than manya poor creature lingering on a bed of sickness.  She is gone tospend a few days in the town with a very worthy woman, who is givenover by the physicians, and wishes to have Charlotte near her inher last moments.  I accompanied her last week on a visit to theVicar of S--, a small village in the mountains, about a leaguehence.  We arrived about four o'clock: Charlotte had taken herlittle sister with her.  When we entered the vicarage court, wefound the good old man sitting on a bench before the door, underthe shade of two large walnut-trees.  At the  sight of Charlottehe seemed to gain new life, rose, forgot his stick, and venturedto walk toward her.  She ran to him, and made him sit down again;then, placing herself by his side, she gave him a number of messagesfrom her father, and then caught up his youngest child, a dirty,ugly little thing, the joy of his old age, and kissed it.  I wishyou could have witnessed her attention to this old man, --how sheraised her voice on account of his deafness; how she told him ofhealthy young people, who had been carried off when it was leastexpected; praised the virtues of Carlsbad, and commended hisdetermination to spend the ensuing summer there; and assured himthat he looked better and stronger than he did when she saw himlast.  I, in the meantime, paid attention to his good lady.  Theold man seemed quite in spirits; and as I could not help admiringthe beauty of the walnut-trees, which formed such an agreeableshade over our heads, he began, though with some little difficulty,to tell us their history.  ""As to the oldest,"" said he, ""we do notknow who planted it, -- some say one clergyman, and some another:but the younger one, there behind us, is exactly the age of my wife,fifty years old next October; her father planted it in the morning,and in the evening she came into the world.  My wife's father wasmy predecessor here, and I cannot tell you how fond he was of thattree; and it is fully as dear to me.  Under the shade of that verytree, upon a log of wood, my wife was seated knitting, when I, apoor student, came into this court for the first time, just sevenand twenty years ago."" Charlotte inquired for his daughter.  Hesaid she was gone with Herr Schmidt to the meadows, and was withthe haymakers.  The old man then resumed his story, and told ushow his predecessor had taken a fancy to him, as had his daughterlikewise; and how he had become first his curate, and subsequentlyhis successor.  He had scarcely finished his story when his daughterreturned through the garden, accompanied by the above-mentionedHerr Schmidt.  She welcomed Charlotte affectionately, and I confessI was much taken with her appearance.  She was a lively-looking,good-humoured brunette, quite competent to amuse one for a shorttime in the country.  Her lover (for such Herr Schmidt evidentlyappeared to be) was a polite, reserved personage, and would notjoin our conversation, notwithstanding all Charlotte's endeavoursto draw him out.  I was much annoyed at observing, by his countenance,that his silence did not arise from want of talent, but from capriceand ill-humour.  This subsequently became very evident, when weset out to take a walk, and Frederica joining Charlotte, with whomI was talking, the worthy gentleman's face, which was naturallyrather sombre, became so dark and angry that Charlotte was obligedto touch my arm, and remind me that I was talking too much toFrederica.  Nothing distresses me more than to see men tormenteach other; particularly when in the flower of their age, in thevery season of pleasure, they waste their few short days of sunshinein quarrels and disputes, and only perceive their error when itis too late to repair it.  This thought dwelt upon my mind; andin the evening, when we returned to the vicar's, and were sittinground the table with our bread end milk, the conversation turnedon the joys and sorrows of the world, I could not resist thetemptation to inveigh bitterly against ill-humour.  ""We are apt,""said I, ""to complain, but - with very little cause, that our happydays are few, and our evil days many.  If our hearts were alwaysdisposed to receive the benefits Heaven sends us, we should acquirestrength to support evil when it comes."" ""But,"" observed the vicar'swife, ""we cannot always command our tempers, so much depends uponthe constitution: when the body suffers, the mind is ill at ease.""""I acknowledge that,"" I continued; ""but we must consider such adisposition in the light of a disease, and inquire whether thereis no remedy for it.""

íííí""I should be glad to hear one,"" said Charlotte: ""at least, I thinkvery much depends upon ourselves; I know it is so with me. Whenanything annoys me, and disturbs my temper, I hasten into thegarden, hum a couple of country dances, and it is all right withme directly.""  ""That is what I meant,"" I replied; ""ill-humourresembles indolence: it is natural to us; but if once we havecourage to exert ourselves, we find our work run fresh from ourhands, and we experience in the activity from which we shrank areal enjoyment.""  Frederica listened very attentively: and theyoung man objected, that we were not masters of ourselves, andstill less so of our feelings.  ""The question is about a disagreeablefeeling,"" I added, ""from which every one would willingly escape,but none know their own power without trial.  Invalids are gladto consult physicians, and submit to the most scrupulous regimen,the most nauseous medicines, in order to recover their health.""I observed that the good old man inclined his head, and exertedhimself to hear our discourse; so I raised my voice, and addressedmyself directly to him.  We preach against a great many crimes,""I observed, ""but I never remember a sermon delivered againstill-humour.""  ""That may do very well for your town clergymen,""said he: ""country people are never ill-humoured; though, indeed,it might be useful, occasionally, to my wife for instance, and thejudge.""  We all laughed, as did he likewise very cordially, tillhe fell into a fit of coughing, which interrupted our conversationfor a time.  Herr Schmidt resumed the subject.  ""You call illhumour a crime,"" he remarked, ""but I think you use too strong aterm.""  ""Not at all,"" I replied, ""if that deserves the name whichis so pernicious to ourselves and our neighbours.  Is it not enoughthat we want the power to make one another happy, must we depriveeach other of the pleasure which we can all make for ourselves?Show me the man who has the courage to hide his ill-humour, whobears the whole burden himself, without disturbing the peace ofthose around him.  No: ill-humour arises from an inward consciousnessof our own want of merit, from a discontent which ever accompaniesthat envy which foolish vanity engenders.  We see people happy,whom we have not made so, and cannot endure the sight.""  Charlottelooked at me with a smile; she observed the emotion with which Ispoke: and a tear in the eyes of Frederica stimulated me to proceed.""Woe unto those,"" I said, ""who use their power over a human heartto destroy the simple pleasures it would naturally enjoy!  All thefavours, all the attentions, in the world cannot compensate forthe loss of that happiness which a cruel tyranny has destroyed.""My heart was full as I spoke.  A recollection of many things whichhad happened pressed upon my mind, and filled my eyes with tears.""We should daily repeat to ourselves,"" I exclaimed, ""that we shouldnot interfere with our friends, unless to leave them in possessionof their own joys, and increase their happiness by sharing it withthem!  But when their souls are tormented by a violent passion,or their hearts rent with grief, is it in your power to affordthem the slightest consolation?

íííí""And when the last fatal malady seizes the being whose untimelygrave you have prepared, when she lies languid and exhausted beforeyou, her dim eyes raised to heaven, and the damp of death upon herpallid brow, there you stand at her bedside like a condemnedcriminal, with the bitter feeling that your whole fortune couldnot save her; and the agonising thought wrings you, that all yourefforts are powerless to impart even a moment's strength to thedeparting soul, or quicken her with a transitory consolation.""

ííííAt these words the remembrance of a similar scene at which I hadbeen once present fell with full force upon my heart. I buried myface in my handkerchief, and hastened from the room, and was onlyrecalled to my recollection by Charlotte's voice, who reminded methat it was time to return home.  With what tenderness she chidme on the way for the too eager interest I took in everything!She declared it would do me injury, and that I ought to sparemyself.  Yes, my angel!  I will do so for your sake.

ííííJULY 6.

ííííShe is still with her dying friend, and is still the same bright,beautiful creature whose presence softens pain, and sheds happinessaround whichever way she turns.  She went out yesterday with herlittle sisters: I knew it, and went to meet them; and we walkedtogether.  In about an hour and a half we returned to the town.We stopped at the spring I am so fond of, and which is now athousand times dearer to me than ever.  Charlotte seated herselfupon the low wall, and we gathered about her.  I looked around,and recalled the time when my heart was unoccupied and free.""Dear fountain!"" I said, ""since that time I have no more come toenjoy cool repose by thy fresh stream: I have passed thee withcareless steps, and scarcely bestowed a glance upon thee.""  Ilooked down, and observed Charlotte's little sister, Jane, comingup the steps with a glass of water.  I turned toward Charlotte,and I felt her influence over me.  Jane at the moment approachedwith the glass.  Her sister, Marianne, wished to take it from her.""No!"" cried the child, with the sweetest expression of face,""Charlotte must drink first.""

ííííThe affection and simplicity with which this was uttered so charmedme, that I sought to express my feelings by catching up the childand kissing her heartily.  She was frightened, and began to cry.""You should not do that,"" said Charlotte: I felt perplexed.  ""Come,Jane,"" she continued, taking her hand, and leading her down thesteps again, ""it is no matter: wash yourself quickly in the freshwater.""  I stood and watched them; and when I saw the little dearrubbing her cheeks with her wet hands, in full belief that allthe impurities contracted from my ugly beard would be washed offby the miraculous water, and how, though Charlotte said it woulddo, she continued still to wash with all her might, as though shethought too much were better than too little, I assure you, Wilhelm,I never attended a baptism with greater reverence; and, whenCharlotte came up from the well, I could have prostrated myselfas before the prophet of an Eastern nation.

ííííIn the evening I would not resist telling the story to a personwho, I thought, possessed some natural feeling, because he was aman of understanding.  But what a mistake I made.  He maintainedit was very wrong of Charlotte, that we should not deceive children,that such things occasioned countless mistakes and superstitions,from which we were bound to protect the young.  It occurred to methen, that this very man had been baptised only a week before; soI said nothing further, but maintained the justice of my ownconvictions.  We should deal with children as God deals with us,we are happiest under the influence of innocent delusions.

ííííJULY 8.

ííííWhat a child is man that he should be so solicitous about a look!What a child is man!  We had been to Walheim: the ladies went ina carriage; but during our walk I thought I saw in Charlotte'sdark eyes -- I am a fool -- but forgive me! you should see them,-- those eyes. -- However, to be brief (for my own eyes are weigheddown with sleep), you must know, when the ladies stepped into theircarriage again, young W. Seldstadt, Andran, and I were standingabout the door.  They are a merry set of fellows, and they wereall laughing and joking together.  I watched Charlotte's eyes.They wandered from one to the other; but they did not light on me,on me, who stood there motionless, and who saw nothing but her!My heart bade her a thousand times adieu, but she noticed me not.The carriage drove off; and my eyes filled with tears.  I lookedafter her: suddenly I saw Charlotte's bonnet leaning out of thewindow, and she turned to look back, was it at me?  My dear friend,I know not; and in this uncertainty I find consolation.  Perhapsshe turned to look at me.  Perhaps!  Good-night -- what a child I am!

ííííJULY lO.

ííííYou should see how foolish I look in company when her name ismentioned, particularly when I am asked plainly how I like her.How I like her!  I detest the phrase.  What sort of creature musthe be who merely liked Charlotte, whose whole heart and senseswere not entirely absorbed by her.  Like her!  Some one asked melately how I liked Ossian.

ííííJULY 11.

ííííMadame M-- is very ill.  I pray for her recovery, because Charlotteshares my sufferings.  I see her occasionally at my friend's house,and to-day she has told me the strangest circumstance.  Old M--is a covetous, miserly fellow, who has long worried and annoyedthe poor lady sadly; but she has borne her afflictions patiently.A few days ago, when the physician informed us that her recoverywas hopeless, she sent for her husband (Charlotte was present),and addressed him thus: ""I have something to confess, which, aftermy decease, may occasion trouble and confusion.  I have hithertoconducted your household as frugally and economically as possible,but you must pardon me for having defrauded you for thirty years.At the commencement of our married life, you allowed a small sumfor the wants of the kitchen, and the other household expenses.When our establishment increased and our property grew larger, Icould not persuade you to increase the weekly allowance in proportion:in short, you know, that, when our wants were greatest, you requiredme to supply everything with seven florins a week.  I took themoney from you without an observation, but made up the weeklydeficiency from the money-chest; as nobody would suspect your wifeof robbing the household bank.  But I have wasted nothing, andshould have been content to meet my eternal Judge without thisconfession, if she, upon whom the management of your establishmentwill devolve after my decease, would be free from embarrassmentupon your insisting that the allowance made to me, your formerwife, was sufficient.""

ííííI talked with Charlotte of the inconceivable manner in which menallow themselves to be blinded; how any one could avoid suspectingsome deception, when seven florins only were allowed to defrayexpenses twice as great.  But I have myself known people whobelieved, without any visible astonishment, that their housepossessed the prophet's never-failing cruse of oil.

ííííJULY 13.

ííííNo, I am not deceived.  In her dark eyes I read a genuine interestin me and in my fortunes.  Yes, I feel it; and I may believe myown heart which tells me -- dare I say it? -- dare I pronouncethe divine words? -- that she loves me!

ííííThat she loves me!  How the idea exalts me in my own eyes!  And,as you can understand my feelings, I may say to you, how I honourmyself since she loves me!

ííííIs this presumption, or is it a consciousness of the truth?  I donot know a man able to supplant me in the heart of Charlotte; andyet when she speaks of her betrothed with so much warmth andaffection, I feel like the soldier who has been stripped of hishonours and titles, and deprived of his sword.

ííííJULY 16.

ííííHow my heart beats when by accident I touch her finger, or my feetmeet hers under the table!  I draw back as if from a furnace; buta secret force impels me forward again, and my senses becomedisordered.  Her innocent, unconscious heart never knows what agonythese little familiarities inflict upon me.  Sometimes when weare talking she Iays her hand upon mine, and in the eagerness ofconversation comes closer to me, and her balmy breath reaches mylips, -- when I feel as if lightning had struck me, and that Icould sink into the earth.  And yet, Wilhelm, with all this heavenlyconfidence, -- if I know myself, and should ever dare -- youunderstand me.  No, no!  my heart is not so corrupt, it is weak,weak enough but is not that a degree of corruption?

ííííShe is to me a sacred being.  All passion is still in her presence:I cannot express my sensations when I am near her.  I feel as ifmy soul beat in every nerve of my body.  There is a melody whichshe plays on the piano with angelic skill, -- so simple is it,and yet so spiritual!  It is her favourite air; and, when sheplays the first note, all pain, care, and sorrow disappear fromme in a moment.

ííííI believe every word that is said of the magic of ancient music.How her simple song enchants me!  Sometimes, when I am ready tocommit suicide, she sings that air; and instantly the gloom andmadness which hung over me are dispersed, and I breathe freelyagain.

ííííJULY 18.

ííííWilhelm, what is the world to our hearts without love?  What isa magic-lantern without light?  You have but to kindle the flamewithin, and the brightest figures shine on the white wall; and,if love only show us fleeting shadows, we are yet happy, when,like mere children, we behold them, and are transported with thesplendid phantoms.  I have not been able to see Charlotte to-day.I was prevented by company from which I could not disengage myself.What was to be done?  I sent my servant to her house, that I mightat least see somebody to-day who had been near her.  Oh, theimpatience with which I waited for his return!  the joy with whichI welcomed him!  I should certainly have caught him in my arms,and kissed him, if I had not been ashamed.

ííííIt is said that the Bonona stone, when placed in the sun, attractsthe rays, and for a time appears luminous in the dark.  So was itwith me and this servant.  The idea that Charlotte's eyes had dwelton his countenance, his cheek, his very apparel, endeared them allinestimably to me, so that at the moment I would not have partedfrom him for a thousand crowns.  His presence made me so happy!Beware of laughing at me, Wilhelm.  Can that be a delusion whichmakes us happy?

ííííJULY 19.

íííí""I shall see her today!"" I exclaim with delight, when I rise inthe morning, and look out with gladness of heart at the bright,beautiful sun.  ""I shall see her today!""  And then I have nofurther wish to form: all, all is included in that one thought.

ííííJULY 2O.

ííííI cannot assent to your proposal that I should accompany theambassador to _______.  I do not love subordination; and we allknow that he is a rough, disagreeable person to be connected with.You say my mother wishes me to be employed.  I could not helplaughing at that.  Am I not sufficiently employed?  And is it notin reality the same, whether I shell peas or count lentils?  Theworld runs on from one folly to another; and the man who, solelyfrom regard to the opinion of others, and without any wish ornecessity of his own, toils after gold, honour, or any otherphantom, is no better than a fool.

ííííJULY 24.

ííííYou insist so much on my not neglecting my drawing, that it wouldbe as well for me to say nothing as to confess how little I havelately done.

ííííI never felt happier, I never understood nature better, even downto the veriest stem or smallest blade of grass ; and yet I amunable to express myself: my powers of execution are so weak,everything seems to swim and float before me, so that I cannotmake a clear, bold outline.  But I fancy I should succeed betterif I had some clay or wax to model.  I shall try, if this stateof mind continues much longer, and will take to modelling, if Ionly knead dough.

ííííI have commenced Charlotte's portrait three times, and have asoften disgraced myself.  This is the more annoying, as I wasformerly very happy in taking likenesses.  I have since sketchedher profile, and must content myself with that.

ííííJULY 25.

ííííYes, dear Charlotte!  I will order and arrange everything.  Onlygive me more commissions, the more the better.  One thing, however,I must request: use no more writing-sand with the dear notes yousend me.  Today I raised your letter hastily to my lips, and itset my teeth on edge.

ííííJULY 26.

ííííI have often determined not to see her so frequently.  But whocould keep such a resolution?  Every day I am exposed to thetemptation, and promise faithfully that to-morrow I will reallystay away: but, when tomorrow comes, I find some irresistiblereason for seeing her; and, before I can account for it, I am withher again.  Either she has said on the previous evening ""You willbe sure to call to-morrow,"" -- and who could stay away then? --orshe gives me some commission, and I find it essential to takeher the answer in person; or the day is fine, and I walk to Walheim;and, when I am there, it is only half a league farther to her.  Iam within the charmed atmosphere, and soon find myself at her side.My grandmother used to tell us a story of a mountain of loadstone.When any vessels came near it, they were instantly deprived oftheir ironwork: the nails flew to the mountain, and the unhappycrew perished amidst the disjointed planks.

ííííJULY 30.

ííííAlbert is arrived, and I must take my departure.  Were he the bestand noblest of men, and I in every respect his inferior, I couldnot endure to see him in possession of such a perfect being.Possession! -- enough, Wilhelm:  her betrothed is here, -- a fine,worthy fellow, whom one cannot help liking.  Fortunately I was notpresent at their meeting.  It would have broken my heart!  And heis so considerate: he has not given Charlotte one kiss in mypresence.  Heaven reward him for it!  I must love him for therespect with which he treats her.  He shows a regard for me, butfor this I suspect I am more indebted to Charlotte than to his ownfancy for me.  Women have a delicate tact in such matters, and itshould be so.  They cannot always succeed in keeping two rivalson terms with each other; but, when they do, they are the onlygainers.

ííííI cannot help esteeming Albert.  The coolness of his temper contrastsstrongly with the impetuosity of mine, which I cannot conceal.He has a great deal of feeling, and is fully sensible of thetreasure he possesses in Charlotte.  He is free from ill-humour,which you know is the fault I detest most.

ííííHe regards me as a man of sense; and my attachment to Charlotte,and the interest I take in all that concerns her, augment histriumph and his love.  I shall not inquire whether he may not attimes tease her with some little jealousies; as I know, that, wereI in his place, I should not be entirely free from such sensations.

ííííBut, be that as it may, my pleasure with Charlotte is over.  Callit folly or infatuation, what signifies a name?  The thing speaksfor itself.  Before Albert came, I knew all that I know now.  Iknew I could make no pretensions to her, nor did I offer any, thatis, as far as it was possible, in the presence of so much loveliness,not to pant for its enjoyment.  And now, behold me like a sillyfellow, staring with astonishment when another comes in, anddeprives me of my love.

ííííI bite my lips, and feel infinite scorn for those who tell me tobe resigned, because there is no help for it.  Let me escape fromthe yoke of such silly subterfuges!  I ramble through the woods;and when I return to Charlotte, and find Albert sitting by herside in the summer-house in the garden, I am unable to bear it,behave like a fool, and commit a thousand extravagances.  ""ForHeaven's sake,"" said Charlotte today, ""let us have no more sceneslike those of last night!  You terrify me when you are so violent.""Between ourselves, I am always away now when he visits her: and Ifeel delighted when I find her alone.

ííííAUGUST 8.

ííííBelieve me, dear Wilhelm, I did not allude to you when I spoke soseverely of those who advise resignation to inevitable fate.  Idid not think it possible for you to indulge such a sentiment.But in fact you are right.  I only suggest one objection.  In thisworld one is seldom reduced to make a selection between twoalternatives.  There are as many varieties of conduct and opinionas there are turns of feature between an aquiline nose and a flatone.

ííííYou will, therefore, permit me to concede your entire argument,and yet contrive means to escape your dilemma.

ííííYour position is this, I hear you say: ""Either you have hopes ofobtaining Charlotte, or you have none. Well, in the first case,pursue your course, and press on to the fulfilment of your wishes.In the second, be a man, and shake off a miserable passion, whichwill enervate and destroy you.""  My dear friend, this is well andeasily said.

ííííBut would you require a wretched being, whose life is slowly wastingunder a lingering disease, to despatch himself at once by thestroke of a dagger?  Does not the very disorder which consumes hisstrength deprive him of the courage to effect his deliverance?

ííííYou may answer me, if you please, with a similar analogy, ""Whowould not prefer the amputation of an arm to the periling of lifeby doubt and procrastination!""  But I know not if I am right, andlet us leave these comparisons.

ííííEnough!  There are moments, Wilhelm, when I could rise up and shakeit all off, and when, if I only knew where to go, I could fly fromthis place.

ííííTHE SAME EVENING.

ííííMy diary, which I have for some time neglected, came before metoday; and I am amazed to see how deliberately I have entangledmyself step by step.  To have seen my position so clearly, andyet to have acted so like a child!  Even still I behold theresult plainly, and yet have no thought of acting with greaterprudence.

ííííAUGUST lO.

ííííIf I were not a fool, I could spend the happiest and most delightfullife here.  So many agreeable circumstances, and of a kind toensure a worthy man's happiness, are seldom united.  Alas!  I feelit too sensibly, -- the heart alone makes our happiness!  To beadmitted into this most charming family, to be loved by the fatheras a son, by the children as a father, and by Charlotte!  then thenoble Albert, who never disturbs my happiness by any appearanceof ill-humour, receiving me with the heartiest affection, andloving me, next to Charlotte, better than all the world!  Wilhelm,you would be delighted to hear us in our rambles, and conversationsabout Charlotte.  Nothing in the world can be more absurd than ourconnection, and yet the thought of it often moves me to tears.

ííííHe tells me sometimes of her excellent mother; how, upon herdeath-bed, she had committed her house and children to Charlotte,and had given Charlotte herself in charge to him; how, since thattime, a new spirit had taken possession of her; how, in care andanxiety for their welfare, she became a real mother to them; howevery moment of her time was devoted to some labour of love intheir behalf, -- and yet her mirth and cheerfulness had neverforsaken her.  I walk by his side, pluck flowers by the way, arrangethem carefully into a nosegay, then fling them into the firststream I pass, and watch them as they float gently away.  I forgetwhether I told you that Albert is to remain here.  He has receiveda government appointment, with a very good salary; and I understandhe is in high favour at court.  I have met few persons so punctualand methodical in business.

ííííAUGUST 12.

ííííCertainly Albert is the best fellow in the world.  I had a strangescene with him yesterday.  I went to take leave of him; for I tookit into my head to spend a few days in these mountains, from whereI now write to you.  As I was walking up and down his room, my eyefell upon his pistols. ""Lend me those pistols,"" said I, ""for myjourney.""  ""By all means,"" he replied, ""if you will take thetrouble to load them; for they only hang there for form.""  Itook down one of them; and he continued, ""Ever since I was nearsuffering for my extreme caution, I will have nothing to do withsuch things.""  I was curious to hear the story.  ""I was staying,""said he, ""some three months ago, at a friend's house in the country.I had a brace of pistols with me, unloaded; and I slept withoutany anxiety.  One rainy afternoon I was sitting by myself, doingnothing, when it occurred to me I do not know how that the housemight be attacked, that we might require the pistols, that we mightin short, you know how we go on fancying, when we have nothingbetter to do.  I gave the pistols to the servant, to clean andload.  He was playing with the maid, and trying to frighten her,when the pistol went off -- God knows how! -- the ramrod was inthe barrel; and it went straight through her right hand, andshattered the thumb.  I had to endure all the lamentation, and topay the surgeon's bill; so, since that time, I have kept all myweapons unloaded.  But, my dear friend, what is the use of prudence?We can never be on our guard against all possible dangers.  However,""-- now, you must know I can tolerate all men till they come to""however;"" -- for it is self-evident that every universal rulemust have its exceptions.  But he is so exceedingly accurate, that,if he only fancies he has said a word too precipitate, or toogeneral, or only half true, he never ceases to qualify, to modify,and extenuate, till at last he appears to have said nothing atall.  Upon this occasion, Albert was deeply immersed in hissubject: I ceased to listen to him, and became lost in reverie.With a sudden motion, I pointed the mouth of the pistol to myforehead, over the right eye.  ""What do vou mean?"" cried Albert,turning back the pistol.  ""It is not loaded,"" said I.  ""And evenif not,"" he answered with impatience,  ""what can you mean? Icannot cornprehend how a man can be so mad as to shoot himself,and the bare idea of it shocks me.""

íííí""But why should any one,"" said I, ""in speaking of an action, ventureto pronounce it mad or wise, or good or bad?  What is the meaningof all this?  Have you carefully studied the secret motives of ouractions?  Do you understand -- can you explain the causes whichoccasion them, and make them inevitable?  If you can, you will beless hasty with your decision.""

íííí""But you will allow,"" said Albert; ""that some actions are criminal,let them spring from whatever motives they may.""  I granted it,and shrugged my shoulders.

íííí""But still, my good friend,"" I continued, ""there are some exceptionshere too.  Theft is a crime; but the man who commits it from extremepoverty, with no design but to save his family from perishing, ishe an object of pity, or of punishment?  Who shall throw the firststone at a husband, who, in the heat of just resentment, sacrificeshis faithless wife and her perfidious seducer? or at the youngmaiden, who, in her weak hour of rapture, forgets herself in theimpetuous joys of love?  Even our laws, cold and cruel as theyare, relent in such cases, and withhold their punishment.""

íííí""That is quite another thing,"" said Albert; ""because a man underthe influence of violent passion loses alI power of reflection,and is regarded as intoxicated or insane.""

íííí""Oh! you people of sound understandings,"" I replied, smiling, ""areever ready to exclaim 'Extravagance, and madness, and intoxication!'You moral men are so calm and so subdued!  You abhor the drunkenman, and detest the extravagant; you pass by, like the Levite,and thank God, like the Pharisee, that you are not like one ofthem.  I have been more than once intoxicated, my passions havealways bordered on extravagance: I am not ashamed to confess it;for I have learned, by my own experience, that all extraordinarymen, who have accomplished great and astonishing actions, haveever been decried by the world as drunken or insane.  And inprivate life, too, is it not intolerable that no one can undertakethe execution of a noble or generous deed, without giving rise tothe exclamation that the doer is intoxicated or mad?  Shame uponyou, ye sages!""

íííí""This is another of your extravagant humours,"" said Albert: ""youalways exaggerate a case, and in this matter you are undoubtedlywrong; for we were speaking of suicide, which you compare withgreat actions, when it is impossible to regard it as anything buta weakness.  It is much easier to die than to bear a life of miserywith fortitude.""

ííííI was on the point of breaking off the conversation, for nothingputs me so completely out of patience as the utterance of a wretchedcommonplace when I am talking from my inmost heart.  However, Icomposed myself, for I had often heard the same observation withsufficient vexation; and I answered him, therefore, with a littlewarmth,  ""You call this a weakness -- beware of being led astrayby appearances.  When a nation, which has long groaned under theintolerable yoke of a tyrant, rises at last and throws off itschains, do you call that weakness?  The man who, to rescue hishouse from the flames, finds his physical strength redoubled, sothat he lifts burdens with ease, which, in the absence of excitement,he could scarcely move; he who, under the rage of an insult, attacksand puts to flight half a score of his enemies, are such personsto be called weak?  My good friend, if resistance be strength, howcan the highest degree of resistance be a weakness?""

ííííAlbert looked steadfastly at me, and said, ""Pray forgive me, butI do not see that the examples you have adduced bear any relationto the question.""  ""Very likely,"" I answered; ""for I have oftenbeen told that my style of illustration borders a little on theabsurd.  But let us see if we cannot place the matter in anotherpoint of view, by inquiring what can be a man's state of mind whoresolves to free himself from the burden of life, -- a burden oftenso pleasant to bear, -- for we cannot otherwise reason fairly uponthe subject.

íííí""Human nature,"" I continued, ""has its limits.  It is able to endurea certain degree of joy, sorrow, and pain, but becomes annihilatedas soon as this measure is exceeded.  The question, therefore, is,not whether a man is strong or weak, but whether he is able toendure the measure of his sufferings.  The suffering may be moralor physical; and in my opinion it is just as absurd to call a mana coward who destroys himself, as to call a man a coward who diesof a malignant fever.""

íííí""Paradox, all paradox!"" exclaimed Albert.  ""Not so paradoxical asyou imagine,"" I replied.  ""You allow that we designate a diseaseas mortal when nature is so severely attacked, and her strengthso far exhausted, that she cannot possibly recover her formercondition under any change that may take place.

íííí""Now, my good friend, apply this to the mind; observe a man in hisnatural, isolated condition; consider how ideas work, and howimpressions fasten on him, till at length a violent passion seizeshim, destroying all his powers of calm reflection, and utterlyruining him.

íííí""It is in vain that a man of sound mind and cool temper understandsthe condition of such a wretched being, in vain he counsels him.He can no more communicate his own wisdom to him than a healthyman can instil his strength into the invalid, by whose bedside heis seated.""

ííííAlbert thought this too general.  I reminded him of a girl who haddrowned herself a short time previously, and I related her history.

ííííShe was a good creature, who had grown up in the narrow sphere ofhousehold industry and weekly appointed labour; one who knew nopleasure beyond indulging in a walk on Sundays, arrayed in herbest attire, accompanied by her friends, or perhaps joining in thedance now and then at some festival, and chatting away her sparehours with a neighbour, discussing the scandal or the quarrels ofthe village, trifles sufficient to occupy her heart.  At lengththe warmth of her nature is influenced by certain new and unknownwishes.  Inflamed by the flatteries of men, her former pleasuresbecome by degrees insipid, till at length she meets with a youthto whom she is attracted by an indescribable feeling; upon him shenow rests all her hopes; she forgets the world around her; shesees, hears, desires nothing but him, and him only.  He aloneoccupies all her thoughts.  Uncorrupted by the idle indulgence ofan enervating vanity, her affection moving steadily toward itsobject, she hopes to become his, and to realise, in an everlastingunion with him, all that happiness which she sought, all that blissfor which she longed.  His repeated promises confirm her hopes:embraces and endearments, which increase the ardour of her desires,overmaster her soul.  She floats in a dim, delusive anticipationof her happiness; and her feelings become excited to their utmosttension.  She stretches out her arms finally to embrace the objectof all her wishes and her lover forsakes her.  Stunned and bewildered,she stands upon a precipice.  All is darkness around her.  Noprospect, no hope, no consolation -- forsaken by him in whom herexistence was centred!  She sees nothing of the wide world beforeher, thinks nothing of the many individuals who might supply thevoid in her heart; she feels herself deserted, forsaken by theworld; and, blinded and impelled by the agony which wrings hersoul, she plunges into the deep, to end her sufferings in the broadembrace of death.  See here, Albert, the history of thousands; andtell me, is not this a case of physical infirmity?  Nature has noway to escape from the labyrinth: her powers are exhausted: shecan contend no longer, and the poor soul must die.

íííí""Shame upon him who can look on calmly, and exclaim, 'The foolishgirl! she should have waited; she should have allowed time to wearoff the impression; her despair would have been softened, and shewould have found another lover to comfort her.'  One might as wellsay, 'The fool, to die of a fever! why did he not wait till hisstrength was restored, till his blood became calm? all would thenhave gone well, and he would have been alive now.'""

ííííAlbert, who could not see the justice of the comparison, offeredsome further objections, and, amongst others, urged that I hadtaken the case of a mere ignorant girl.  But how any man of sense,of more enlarged views and experience, could be excused, he wasunable to comprehend.  ""My friend!"" I exclaimed, ""man is but man;and, whatever be the extent of his reasoning powers, they are oflittle avail when passion rages within, and he feels himselfconfined by the narrow limits of nature.  It were better, then --but we will talk of this some other time,"" I said, and caught upmy hat.  Alas! my heart was full; and we parted without convictionon either side.  How rarely in this world do men understand eachother!

ííííAUGUST 15.

ííííThere can be no doubt that in this world nothing is so indispensableas love.  I observe that Charlotte could not lose me without apang, and the very children have but one wish; that is, that Ishould visit them again to-morrow.  I went this afternoon to tuneCharlotte's piano.  But I could not do it, for the little onesinsisted on my telling them a story; and Charlotte herself urgedme to satisfy them.  I waited upon them at tea, and they are nowas fully contented with me as with Charlotte; and I told them myvery best tale of the princess who was waited upon by dwarfs.I improve myself by this exercise, and am quite surprised at theimpression my stories create.  If I sometimes invent an incidentwhich I forget upon the next narration, they remind one directlythat the story was different before; so that I now endeavour torelate with exactness the same anecdote in the same monotonoustone, which never changes.  I find by this, how much an authorinjures his works by altering them, even though they be improvedin a poetical point of view.  The first impression is readilyreceived.  We are so constituted that we believe the most incrediblethings; and, once they are engraved upon the memory, woe to himwho would endeavour to efface them.

ííííAUGUST 18.

ííííMust it ever be thus, -- that the source of our happiness mustalso be the fountain of our misery?  The full and ardent sentimentwhich animated my heart with the love of nature, overwhelming mewith a torrent of delight, and which brought all paradise beforeme, has now become an insupportable torment, a demon which perpetuallypursues and harasses me.  When in bygone days I gazed from theserocks upon yonder mountains across the river, and upon the green,flowery valley before me, and saw alI nature budding and burstingaround; the hills clothed from foot to peak with tall, thick foresttrees; the valleys in all their varied windings, shaded with theloveliest woods; and the soft river gliding along amongst thelisping reeds, mirroring the beautiful clouds which the soft eveningbreeze wafted across the sky, -- when I heard the groves about memelodious with the music of birds, and saw the million swarms ofinsects dancing in the last golden beams of the sun, whose settingrays awoke the humming beetles from their grassy beds, whilst thesubdued tumult around directed my attention to the ground, and Ithere observed the arid rock compelled to yield nutriment to thedry moss, whilst the heath flourished upon the barren sands belowme, all this displayed to me the inner warmth which animates allnature, and filled and glowed within my heart.  I felt myselfexalted by this overflowing fulness to the perception of theGodhead, and the glorious forms of an infinite universe becamevisible to my soul!  Stupendous mountains encompassed me, abyssesyawned at my feet, and cataracts fell headlong down before me;impetuous rivers rolled through the plain, and rocks and mountainsresounded from afar.  In the depths of the earth I saw innumerablepowers in motion, and multiplying to infinity; whilst upon itssurface, and beneath the heavens, there teemed ten thousand varietiesof living creatures.  Everything around is alive with an infinitenumber of forms; while mankind fly for security to their pettyhouses, from the shelter of which they rule in their imaginationsover the wide-extended universe.  Poor fool! in whose pettyestimation all things are little.  From the inaccessible mountains,across the desert which no mortal foot has trod, far as the confinesof the unknown ocean, breathes the spirit of the eternal Creator;and every atom to which he has given existence finds favour in hissight.  Ah, how often at that time has the flight of a bird, soaringabove my head, inspired me with the desire of being transportedto the shores of the immeasurable waters, there to quaff thepleasures of life from the foaming goblet of the Infinite, and topartake, if but for a moment even, with the confined powers of mysoul, the beatitude of that Creator who accomplishes all thingsin himself, and through himself!

ííííMy dear friend, the bare recollection of those hours still consolesme.  Even this effort to recall those ineffable sensations, andgive them utterance, exalts my soul above itself, and makes medoubly feel the intensity of my present anguish.

ííííIt is as if a curtain had been drawn from before my eyes, and,instead of prospects of eternal life, the abyss of an ever opengrave yawned before me.  Can we say of anything that it existswhen all passes away, when time, with the speed of a storm, carriesall things onward, -- and our transitory existence, hurried alongby the torrent, is either swallowed up by the waves or dashedagainst the rocks?  There is not a moment but preys upon you, --and upon all around you, not a moment in which you do not yourselfbecome a destroyer.  The most innocent walk deprives of lifethousands of poor insects: one step destroys the fabric of theindustrious ant, and converts a little world into chaos.  No: itis not the great and rare calamities of the world, the floods whichsweep away whole villages, the earthquakes which swallow up ourtowns, that affect me.  My heart is wasted by the thought of thatdestructive power which lies concealed in every part of universalnature.  Nature has formed nothing that does not consume itself,and every object near it: so that, surrounded by earth and air,and all the active powers, I wander on my way with aching heart;and the universe is to me a fearful monster, for ever devouringits own offspring.

ííííAUGUST 21.

ííííIn vain do I stretch out my arms toward her when I awaken in themorning from my weary slumbers.  In vain do I seek for her at nightin my bed, when some innocent dream has happily deceived me, andplaced her near me in the fields, when I have seized her hand andcovered it with countless kisses.  And when I feel for her in thehalf confusion of sleep, with the happy sense that she is near,tears flow from my oppressed heart; and, bereft of all comfort, Iweep over my future woes.

ííííAUGUST 22.

ííííWhat a misfortune, Wilhelm!  My active spirits have degeneratedinto contented indolence.  I cannot be idle, and yet I am unableto set to work.  I cannot think: I have no longer any feeling forthe beauties of nature, and books are distasteful to me.  Once wegive ourselves up, we are totally lost.  Many a time and oft Iwish I were a common labourer; that, awakening in the morning, Imight have but one prospect, one pursuit, one hope, for the daywhich has dawned.  I often envy Albert when I see him buried in aheap of papers and parchments, and I fancy I should be happy wereI in his place.  Often impressed with this feeling I have been onthe point of writing to you and to the minister, for the appointmentat the embassy, which you think I might obtain.  I believe I mightprocure it.  The minister has long shown a regard for me, and hasfrequently urged me to seek employment.  It is the business of anhour only.  Now and then the fable of the horse recurs to me.Weary of liberty, he suffered himself to be saddled and bridled,and was ridden to death for his pains.  I know not what to determineupon.  For is not this anxiety for change the consequence of thatrestless spirit which would pursue me equally in every situationof life?

ííííAUGUST 28.

ííííIf my ills would admit of any cure, they would certainly be curedhere.  This is my birthday, and early in the morning I received apacket from Albert.  Upon opening it, I found one of the pinkribbons which Charlotte wore in her dress the first time I saw her,and which I had several times asked her to give me.  With it weretwo volumes in duodecimo of Wetstein's ""Homer,"" a book I had oftenwished for, to save me the inconvenience of carrying the largeErnestine edition with me upon my walks.  You see how they anticipatemy wishes, how well they understand all those little attentionsof friendship, so superior to the costly presents of the great,which are humiliating.  I kissed the ribbon a thousand times, andin every breath inhaled the remembrance of those happy and irrevocabledays which filled me with the keenest joy.  Such, Wilhelm, is ourfate.  I do not murmur at it: the flowers of life are but visionary.How many pass away, and leave no trace behind -- how few yield anyfruit -- and the fruit itself, how rarely does it ripen! And yetthere are flowers enough! and is it not strange, my friend, thatwe should suffer the little that does really ripen, to rot, decay,and perish unenjoyed?  Farewell!  This is a glorious summer.  Ioften climb into the trees in Charlotte's orchard, and shake downthe pears that hang on the highest branches.  She stands below,and catches them as they fall.

ííííAUGUST 3O.

ííííUnhappy being that I am!  Why do I thus deceive myself?  What isto come of all this wild, aimless, endless passion?  I cannot prayexcept to her.  My imagination sees nothing but her: all surroundingobjects are of no account, except as they relate to her.  In thisdreamy state I enjoy many happy hours, till at length I feelcompelled to tear myself away from her.  Ah, Wilhelm, to whatdoes not my heart often compel me!  When I have spent several hoursin her company, till I feel completely absorbed by her figure, hergrace, the divine expression of her thoughts, my mind becomesgradually excited to the highest excess, my sight grows dim, myhearing confused, my breathing oppressed as if by the hand of amurderer, and my beating heart seeks to obtain relief for my achingsenses.  I am sometimes unconscious whether I really exist.  Ifin such moments I find no sympathy, and Charlotte does not allowme to enjoy the melancholy consolation of bathing her hand withmy tears, I feel compelled to tear myself from her, when I eitherwander through the country, climb some precipitous cliff, or forcea path through the trackless thicket, where I am lacerated andtorn by thorns and briers; and thence I find relief.  Sometimes Ilie stretched on the ground, overcome with fatigue and dying withthirst; sometimes, late in the night, when the moon shines aboveme, I recline against an aged tree in some sequestered forest, torest my weary limbs, when, exhausted and worn, I sleep till breakof day.  O Wilhelm! the hermit's cell, his sackcloth, and girdleof thorns would be luxury and indulgence compared with what I suffer.Adieu!  I see no end to this wretchedness except the grave.

ííííSEPTEMBER 3.

ííííI must away.  Thank you, Wilhelm, for determining my waveringpurpose.  For a whole fortnight I have thought of leaving her.  Imust away.  She has returned to town, and is at the house of afriend.  And then, Albert -- yes, I must go.

ííííSEPTEMBER 1O.

ííííOh, what a night, Wilhelm!  I can henceforth bear anything.  Ishall never see her again.  Oh, why cannot I fall on your neck,and, with floods of tears and raptures, give utterance to all thepassions which distract my heart!  Here I sit gasping for breath,and struggling to compose myself.  I wait for day, and at sunrisethe horses are to be at the door.

ííííAnd she is sleeping calmly, little suspecting that she has seen mefor the last time.  I am free.  I have had the courage, in aninterview of two hours' duration, not to betray my intention.  AndO Wilhelm, what a conversation it was!

ííííAlbert had promised to come to Charlotte in the garden immediatelyafter supper.  I was upon the terrace under the tall chestnut trees,and watched the setting sun.  I saw him sink for the last timebeneath this delightful valley and silent stream.  I had oftenvisited the same spot with Charlotte, and witnessed that glorioussight; and now -- I was walking up and down the very avenue whichwas so dear to me.  A secret sympathy had frequently drawn methither before I knew Charlotte; and we were delighted when, inour early acquaintance, we discovered that we each loved the samespot, which is indeed as romantic as any that ever captivated thefancy of an artist.

íííí>From beneath the chestnut trees, there is an extensive view.  ButI remember that I have mentioned all this in a former letter, andhave described the tall mass of beech trees at the end, and howthe avenue grows darker and darker as it winds its way among them,till it ends in a gloomy recess, which has all the charm of amysterious solitude.  I still remember the strange feeling ofmelancholy which came over me the first time I entered that darkretreat, at bright midday.  I felt some secret foreboding that itwould, one day, be to me the scene of some happiness or misery.

ííííI had spent half an hour struggling between the contending thoughtsof going and returning, when I heard them coming up the terrace.I ran to meet them.  I trembled as I took her hand, and kissed it.As we reached the top of the terrace, the moon rose from behindthe wooded hill.  We conversed on many subjects, and, withoutperceiving it, approached the gloomy recess.  Charlotte entered,and sat down.  Albert seated himself beside her.  I did the same,but my agitation did not suffer me to remain long seated.  I gotup, and stood before her, then walked backward and forward, andsat down again.  I was restless and miserable.  Charlotte drew ourattention to the beautiful effect of the moonlight, which threw asilver hue over the terrace in front of us, beyond the beech trees.It was a glorious sight, and was rendered more striking by thedarkness which surrounded the spot where we were.  We remained forsome time silent, when Charlotte observed, ""Whenever I walk bymoonlight, it brings to my remembrance all my beloved and departedfriends, and I am filled with thoughts of death and futurity.  Weshall live again, Werther!"" she continued, with a firm but feelingvoice; ""but shall we know one another again what do you think?what do you say?""

íííí""Charlotte,"" I said, as I took her hand in mine, and my eyes filledwith tears, ""we shall see each other again -- here and hereafterwe shall meet again.""  I could say no more.  Why, Wilhelm, shouldshe put this question to me, just at the monent when the fear ofour cruel separation filled my heart?

íííí""And oh! do those departed ones know how we are employed here? dothey know when we are well and happy? do they know when we recalltheir memories with the fondest love?  In the silent hour ofevening the shade of my mother hovers around me; when seatedin the midst of my children, I see them assembled near me, asthey used to assemble near her; and then I raise my anxious eyesto heaven, and wish she could look down upon us, and witness howI fulfil the promise I made to her in her last moments, to be amother to her children.  With what emotion do I then exclaim,'Pardon, dearest of mothers, pardon me, if I do not adequatelysupply your place!  Alas!  I do my utmost.  They are clothed andfed; and, still better, they are loved and educated.  Could youbut see, sweet saint! the peace and harmony that dwells amongstus, you would glorify God with the warmest feelings of gratitude,to whom, in your last hour, you addressed such fervent prayers forour happiness.'""  Thus did she express herself; but O Wilhelm! whocan do justice to her language? how can cold and passionless wordsconvey the heavenly expressions of the spirit?  Albert interruptedher gently.  ""This affects you too deeply, my dear Charlotte.  Iknow your soul dwells on such recollections wlth intense delight;but I implore -- ""  ""O Albert!"" she continued, ""I am sure you donot forget the evenings when we three used to sit at the littleround table, when papa was absent, and the little ones had retired.You often had a good book with you, but seldom read it; theconversation of that noble being was preferable to everything, --that beautiful, bright, gentle, and yet ever-toiling woman.  Godalone knows how I have supplicated with tears on my nightly couch,that I might be like her.""

ííííI threw myself at her feet, and, seizing her hand, bedewed it witha thousand tears.  ""Charlotte!"" I exclaimed, ""God's blessing andyour mother's spirit are upon you.""  ""Oh! that you had known her,""she said, with a warm pressure of the hand. ""She was worthy ofbeing known to you.""  I thought I should have fainted: never hadI received praise so flattering.  She continued, ""And yet she wasdoomed to die in the flower of her youth, when her youngest childwas scarcely six months old.  Her illness was but short, but shewas calm and resigned; and it was only for her children, especiallythe youngest, that she felt unhappy.  When her end drew nigh, shebade me bring them to her.  I obeyed.  The younger ones knew nothingof their approaching loss, while the elder ones were quite overcomewith grief.  They stood around the bed; and she raised her feeblehands to heaven, and prayed over them; then, kissing them in turn,she dismissed them, and said to me, 'Be you a mother to them.'  Igave her my hand.  'You are promising much, my child,' she said:'a mother's fondness and a mother's care!  I have often witnessed,by your tears of gratitude, that you know what is a mother'stenderness: show it to your brothers and sisters, and be dutifuland faithful to your father as a wife; you will be his comfort.'She inquired for him.  He had retired to conceal his intolerableanguish, -- he was heartbroken, ""Albert, you were in the room.She heard some one moving: she inquired who it was, and desiredyou to approach.  She surveyed us both with a look of composureand satisfaction, expressive of her conviction that we should behappy, -- happy with one another.""  Albert fell upon her neck, andkissed her, and exclaimed, ""We are so, and we shall be so!"" EvenAlbert, generally so tranquil, had quite lost his composure; andI was excited beyond expression.

íííí""And such a being,"" She continued, ""was to leave us, Werther!Great God, must we thus part with everything we hold dear in thisworld?  Nobody felt this more acutely than the children: they criedand lamented for a long time afterward, complaining that men hadcarried away their dear mamma.""

ííííCharlotte rose.  It aroused me; but I continued sitting, and heldher hand.  ""Let us go,"" she said: ""it grows late.""  She attemptedto withdraw her hand: I held it still.  ""We shall see each otheragain,"" I exclaimed: ""we shall recognise each other under everypossible change!  I am going,"" I continued, ""going willingly; but,should I say for ever, perhaps I may not keep my word.  Adieu,Charlotte; adieu, Albert.  We shall meet again.""  ""Yes: tomorrow,I think,"" she answered with a smile.  Tomorrow! how I felt the word!Ah! she little thought, when she drew her hand away from mine.They walked down the avenue.  I stood gazing after them in themoonlight.  I threw myself upon the ground, and wept: I then sprangup, and ran out upon the terrace, and saw, under the shade of thelinden-trees, her white dress disappearing near the garden-gate.I stretched out my arms, and she vanished.

ííííBOOK II.

ííííOCTOBER 2O.

ííííWe arrived here yesterday.  The ambassador is indisposed, and willnot go out for some days.  If he were less peevish and morose, allwould be well.  I see but too plainly that Heaven has destined meto severe trials; but courage! a light heart may bear anything.A light heart!  I smile to find such a word proceeding from my pen.A little more lightheartedness would render me the happiest beingunder the sun.  But must I despair of my talents and faculties,whilst others of far inferior abilities parade before me with theutmost self-satisfaction?  Gracious Providence, to whom I owe allmy powers, why didst thou not withhold some of those blessings Ipossess, and substitute in their place a feeling of self-confidenceand contentment?

ííííBut patience! all will yet be well; for I assure you, my dearfriend, you were right: since I have been obliged to associatecontinually with other people, and observe what they do, and howthey employ themselves, I have become far better satisfied withmyself.  For we are so constituted by nature, that we are everprone to compare ourselves with others; and our happiness or miserydepends very much on the objects and persons around us.  On thisaccount, nothing is more dangerous than solitude: there ourimagination, always disposed to rise, taking a new flight on thewings of fancy, pictures to us a chain of beings of whom we seemthe most inferior.  All things appear greater than they reallyare, and all seem superior to us.  This operation of the mind isquite natural: we so continually feel our own imperfections, andfancy we perceive in others the qualities we do not possess,attributing to them also all that we enjoy ourselves, that by thisprocess we form the idea of a perfect, happy man, -- a man, however,who only exists in our own imagination.

ííííBut when, in spite of weakness and disappointments, we set to workin earnest, and persevere steadily, we often find, that, thoughobliged continually to tack, we make more way than others who havethe assistance of wind and tide; and, in truth, there can be nogreater satisfaction than to keep pace with others or outstripthem in the race.

ííííNovember 26.

ííííI begin to find my situation here more tolerable, considering allcircumstances.  I find a great advantage in being much occupied;and the number of persons I meet, and their different pursuits,create a varied entertainment for me.  I have formed the acquaintanceof the Count C-- and I esteem him more and more every day.  He isa man of strong understanding and great discernment; but, thoughhe sees farther than other people, he is not on that account coldin his manner, but capable of inspiring and returning the warmestaffection.  He appeared interested in me on one occasion, when Ihad to transact some business with him.  He perceived, at the firstword, that we understood each other, and that he could conversewith me in a different tone from what he used with others.  Icannot sufficiently esteem his frank and open kindness to me.  Itis the greatest and most genuine of pleasures to observe a greatmind in sympathy with our own.

ííííDECEMBER 24.

ííííAs I anticipated, the ambassador occasions me infinite annoyance.He is the most punctilious blockhead under heaven.  He doeseverything step by step, with the trifling minuteness of an oldwoman; and he is a man whom it is impossible to please, becausehe is never pleased with himself.  I like to do business regularlyand cheerfully, and, when it is finished, to leave it.  But heconstantly returns my papers to me, saying, ""They will do,"" butrecommending me to look over them again, as ""one may always improveby using a better word or a more appropriate particle.""  I thenlose all patience, and wish myself at the devil's.  Not a conjunction,not an adverb, must be omitted: he has a deadly antipathy to allthose transpositions of which I am so fond; and, if the music ofour periods is not tuned to the established, official key, hecannot comprehend our meaning.  It is deplorable to be connectedwith such a fellow.

ííííMy acquaintance with the Count C-- is the only compensation forsuch an evil.  He told me frankly, the other day, that he was muchdispleased with the difficulties and delays of the ambassador;that people like him are obstacles, both to themselves and toothers.  ""But,"" added he, ""one must submit, like a traveller whohas to ascend a mountain: if the mountain was not there, the roadwould be both shorter and pleasanter; but there it is, and he mustget over it.""

ííííThe old man perceives the count's partiality for me: this annoyshim, and, he seizes every opportunity to depreciate the count inmy hearing.  I naturally defend him, and that only makes mattersworse.  Yesterday he made me indignant, for he also alluded to me.""The count,"" he said, ""is a man of the world, and a good man ofbusiness: his style is good, and he writes with facility; but,like other geniuses, he has no solid learning.""  He looked at mewith an expression that seemed to ask if I felt the blow.  But itdid not produce the desired effect: I despise a man who can thinkand act in such a manner.  However, I made a stand, and answeredwith not a little warmth.  The count, I said, was a man entitledto respect, alike for his character and his acquirements.  I hadnever met a person whose mind was stored with more useful andextensive knowledge, -- who had, in fact, mastered such an infinitevariety of subjects, and who yet retained all his activity for thedetails of ordinary business.  This was altogether beyond hiscomprehension; and I took my leave, lest my anger should be toohighly excited by some new absurdity of his.

ííííAnd you are to blame for all this, you who persuaded me to bendmy neck to this yoke by preaching a life of activity to me.  Ifthe man who plants vegetables, and carries his corn to town onmarket-days, is not more usefully employed than I am, then let mework ten years longer at the galleys to which I am now chained.

ííííOh, the brilliant wretchedness, the weariness, that one is doomedto witness among the silly people whom we meet in society here!The ambition of rank!  How they watch, how they toil, to gainprecedence!  What poor and contemptible passions are displayed intheir utter nakedness!  We have a woman here, for example, whonever ceases to entertain the company with accounts of her familyand her estates.  Any stranger would consider her a silly being,whose head was turned by her pretensions to rank and property; butshe is in reality even more ridiculous, the daughter of a meremagistrate's clerk from this neighbourhood.  I cannot understandhow human beings can so debase themselves.

ííííEvery day I observe more and more the folly of judging of othersby ourselves; and I have so much trouble with myseif, and my ownheart is in such constant agitation, that I am well content to letothers pursue their own course, if they only allow me the sameprivilege.

ííííWhat provokes me most is the unhappy extent to which distinctionsof rank are carried.  I know perfectly well how necessary areinequalities of condition, and I am sensible of the advantages Imyself derive therefrom; but I would not have these institutionsprove a barrier to the small chance of happiness which I may enjoyon this earth.

ííííI have lately become acquainted with a Miss B--, a very agreeablegirl, who has retained her natural manners in the midst of artificiallife.  Our first conversation pleased us both equally; and, attaking leave, I requested permission to visit her.  She consentedin so obliging a manner, that I waited with impatience for thearrival of the happy moment.  She is not a native of this place,but resides here with her aunt.  The countenance of the old ladyis not prepossessing.  I paid her much attention, addressing thegreater part of my conversation to her; and, in less than half anhour, I discovered what her niece subsequently acknowledged to me,that her aged aunt, having but a small fortune, and a still smallershare of understanding, enjoys no satisfaction except in thepedigree of her ancestors, no protection save in her noble birth,and no enjoyment but in looking from her castle over the heads ofthe humble citizens.  She was, no doubt, handsome in her youth,and in her early years probably trifled away her time in renderingmany a poor youth the sport of her caprice: in her riper years shehas submitted to the yoke of a veteran officer, who, in return forher person and her small independence, has spent with her what wemay designate her age of brass.  He is dead; and she is now awidow, and deserted.  She spends her iron age alone, and would notbe approached, except for the loveliness of her niece.

ííííJANUARY 8, 1772.

ííííWhat beings are men, whose whole thoughts are occupied with formand ceremony, who for years together devote their mental andphysical exertions to the task of advancing themselves but onestep, and endeavouring to occupy a higher place at the table.  Notthat such persons would otherwise want employment: on the contrary,they give themselves much trouble by neglecting important businessfor such petty trifles.  Last week a question of precedence aroseat a sledging-party, and all our amusement was spoiled.

ííííThe silly creatures cannot see that it is not place which constitutesreal greatness, since the man who occupies the first place butseldom plays the principal part.  How many kings are governed bytheir ministers -- how many ministers by their secretaries?  Who, insuch cases, is really the chief?  He, as it seems to me, who cansee through the others, and possesses strength or skill enough tomake their power or passions subservient to the execution of hisown designs.

ííííJANUARY 20.

ííííI must write to you from this place, my dear Charlotte, from asmall room in a country inn, where I have taken shelter from asevere storm.  During my whole residence in that wretched placeD--, where I lived amongst strangers, -- strangers, indeed, tothis heart, -- I never at any time felt the smallest inclinationto correspond with you; but in this cottage, in this retirement,in this solitude, with the snow and hail beating against mylattice-pane, you are my first thought.  The instant I entered,your figure rose up before me, and the remembrance!  O my Charlotte,the sacred, tender remembrance!  Gracious Heaven! restore to methe happy moment of our first acquaintance.

ííííCould you but see me, my dear Charlotte, in the whirl ofdissipation, -- how my senses are dried up, but my heart is at notime full.  I enjoy no single moment of happiness: all is vain --nothing touches me.  I stand, as it were, before the raree-show:I see the little puppets move, and I ask whether it is not anoptical illusion.  I am amused with these puppets, or, rather, Iam myself one of them: but, when I sometimes grasp my neighbour'shand, I feel that it is not natural; and I withdraw mine with ashudder.  In the evening I say I will enjoy the next morning'ssunrise, and yet I remain in bed: in the day I promise to rambleby moonlight; and I, nevertheless, remain at home.  I know not whyI rise, nor why I go to sleep.

ííííThe leaven which animated my existence is gone: the charm whichcheered me in the gloom of night, and aroused me from my morningslumbers, is for ever fled.

ííííI have found but one being here to interest me, a Miss B--.  Sheresembles you, my dear Charlotte, if any one can possibly resembleyou.  ""Ah!"" you will say, ""he has learned how to pay fine compliments.""And this is partly true.  I have been very agreeable lately, asit was not in my power to be otherwise.  I have, moreover, a dealof wit: and the ladies say that no one understands flattery better,or falsehoods you will add; since the one accomplishment invariablyaccompanies the other.  But I must tell you of Miss B--.  She hasabundance of soul, which flashes from her deep blue eyes.  Herrank is a torment to her, and satisfies no one desire of her heart.She would gladly retire from this whirl of fashion, and we oftenpicture to ourselves a life of undisturbed happiness in distantscenes of rural retirement: and then we speak of you, my dearCharlotte; for she knows you, and renders homage to your merits;but her homage is not exacted, but voluntary, she loves you, anddelights to hear you made the subject of conversation.

ííííOh, that I were sitting at your feet in your favourite little room,with the dear children playing around us!  If they became troublesometo you, I would tell them some appalling goblin story; and theywould crowd round me with silent attention.  The sun is settingin glory; his last rays are shining on the snow, which covers theface of the country: the storm is over, and I must return to mydungeon.  Adieu!-- Is Albert with you? and what is he to you?  Godforgive the question.

ííííFEBRUARY 8.

ííííFor a week past we have had the most wretched weather: but thisto me is a blessing; for, during my residence here, not a singlefine day has beamed from the heavens, but has been lost to me bythe intrusion of somebody.  During the severity of rain, sleet,frost, and storm, I congratulate myself that it cannot be worseindoors than abroad, nor worse abroad than it is within doors; andso I become reconciled.  When the sun rises bright in the morning,and promises a glorious day, I never omit to exclaim, ""There, now,they have another blessing from Heaven, which they will be sureto destroy: they spoil everything, -- health, fame, happiness,amusement; and they do this generally through folly, ignorance,or imbecility, and always, according to their own account, withthe best intentions!""  I could often beseech them, on my bendedknees, to be less resolved upon their own destruction.

ííííFEBRUARY 17.

ííííI fear that my ambassador and I shall not continue much longertogether.  He is really growing past endurance.  He transactshis business in so ridiculous a manner, that I am often compelledto contradict him, and do things my own way; and then, of course,he thinks them very ill done.  He complained of me lately on thisaccount at court; and the minister gave me a reprimand, -- agentle one it is true, but still a reprimand.  In consequence ofthis, I was about to tender my resignation, when I received aletter, to which I submitted with great respect, on account of thehigh, noble, and generous spirit which dictated it.  He endeavouredto soothe my excessive sensibility, paid a tribute to my extremeideas of duty, of good example, and of perseverance in business,as the fruit of my youthful ardour, an impulse which he did notseek to destroy, but only to moderate, that it might have properplay and be productive of good.  So now I am at rest for anotherweek, and no longer at variance with myself.  Content and peaceof mind are valuable things: I could wish, my dear friend, thatthese precious jewels were less transitory.

ííííFERRUARY 20.

ííííGod bless you, my dear friends, and may he grant you that happinesswhich he denies to me!

ííííI thank you, Albert, for having deceived me.  I waited for thenews that your wedding-day was fixed; and I intended on that day,with solemnity, to take down Charlotte's profile from the wall,and to bury it with some other papers I possess.  You are nowunited, and her picture still remains here.  Well, let it remain!Why should it not?  I know that I am still one of your society,that I still occupy a place uninjured in Charlotte's heart, thatI hold the second place therein; and I intend to keep it.  Oh, Ishould become mad if she could forget!  Albert, that thought ishell!  Farewell, Albert farewell, angel of heaven farewell, Charlotte!

ííííMARCH 15.

ííííI have just had a sad adventure, which will drive me away fromhere.  I lose all patience! -- Death! -- It is not to be remedied;and you alone are to blame, for you urged and impelled me to filla post for which I was by no means suited.  I have now reason tobe satisfied, and so have you!  But, that you may not again attributethis fatality to my impetuous temper, I send you, my dear sir, aplain and simple narration of the affair, as a mere chronicler offacts would describe it.

ííííThe Count of O-- likes and distinguishes me.  It is well known,and I have mentioned this to you a hundred times.  Yesterday Idined with him.  It is the day on which the nobility are accustomedto assemble at his house in the evening.  I never once thought ofthe assembly, nor that we subalterns did not belong to such society.Well, I dined with the count; and, after dinner, we adjourned tothe large hall.  We walked up and down together: and I conversedwith him, and with Colonel B--, who joined us; and in this mannerthe hour for the assembly approached.  God knows, I was thinkingof nothing, when who should enter but the honourable Lady accompaniedby her noble husband and their silly, scheming daughter, with hersmall waist and flat neck; and, with disdainful looks and a haughtyair they passed me by.  As I heartily detest the whole race, Idetermined upon going away; and only waited till the count haddisengaged himself from their impertinent prattle, to take leave,when the agreeable Miss B-- came in.  As I never meet her withoutexperiencing a heartfelt pleasure, I stayed and talked to her,leaning over the back of her chair, and did not perceive, tillafter some time, that she seemed a little confused, and ceased toanswer me with her usual ease of manner.  I was struck with it.""Heavens!"" I said to myself, ""can she, too, be like the rest?""  Ifelt annoyed, and was about to withdraw; but I remained,notwithstanding, forming excuses for her conduct, fancying she didnot mean it, and still hoping to receive some friendly recognition.The rest of the company now arrived. There was the Baron F --, inan entire suit that dated from the coronation of Francis I.; theChancellor N--, with his deaf wife; the shabbily-dressed I--, whoseold-fashioned coat bore evidence of modern repairs: this crownedthe whole.  I conversed with some of my acquaintances, but theyanswered me laconically.  I was engaged in observing Miss B--, anddid not notice that the women were whispering at the end of theroom, that the murmur extended by degrees to the men, that MadameS-- addressed the count with much warmth (this was all related tome subsequently by Miss B--); till at length the count came up tome, and took me to the window.  ""You know our ridiculous customs,""he said.  ""I perceive the company is rather displeased at yourbeing here.  I would not on any account--""  ""I beg your excellency'spardon!"" I exclaimed.  ""I ought to have thought of this before,but I know you will forgive this little inattention.  I was going,""I added, ""some time ago, but my evil genius detained me.""  And Ismiled and bowed, to take my leave.  He shook me by the hand, ina manner which expressed everything.  I hastened at once from theillustrious assembly, sprang into a carriage, and drove to M--.I contemplated the setting sun from the top of the hill, and readthat beautiful passage in Homer, where Ulysses is entertained bythe hospitable herdsmen.  This was indeed delightful.

ííííI returned home to supper in the evening.  But few persons wereassembled in the room.  They had turned up a corner of the table-cloth,and were playing at dice.  The good-natured A-- came in.  He laiddown his hat when he saw me, approached me, and said in a low tone,""You have met with a disagreeable adventure.""  ""I!"" I exclaimed.""The count obliged you to withdraw from the assembly!""  ""Deucetake the assembly!"" said I.  ""I was very glad to be gone.""  ""I amdelighted,"" he added, ""that you take it so lightly.  I am onlysorry that it is already so much spoken of.""  The circumstancethen began to pain me. I fancied that every one who sat down, andeven looked at me, was thinking of this incident; and my heartbecame embittered.

ííííAnd now I could plunge a dagger into my bosom, when I hear myselfeverywhere pitied, and observe the triumph of my enemies, who saythat this is always the case with vain persons, whose heads areturned with conceit, who affect to despise forms and such petty,idle nonsense.

ííííSay what you will of fortitude, but show me the man who can patientlyendure the laughter of fools, when they have obtained an advantageover him.  'Tis only when their nonsense is without foundationthat one can suffer it without complaint.

ííííMarch 16.

ííííEverything conspires against me.  I met Miss B-- walking to-day.I could not help joining her; and, when we were at a little distancefrom her companions, I expressed my sense of her altered mannertoward me.  ""O Werther!"" she said, in a tone of emotion, ""you, whoknow my heart, how could you so ill interpret my distress?  Whatdid I not suffer for you, from the moment you entered the room!I foresaw it all, a hundred times was I on the point of mentioningit to you.  I knew that the S--s and T--s, with their husbands,would quit the room, rather than remain in your company.  I knewthat the count would not break with them: and now so much is saidabout it.""  ""How!"" I exclaimed, and endeavoured to conceal myemotion; for all that Adelin had mentioned to me yesterday recurredto me painfully at that moment.  ""Oh, how much it has already costme!"" said this amiable girl, while her eyes filled with tears.  Icould scarcely contain myself, and was ready to throw myself ather feet.  ""Explain yourself!""  I cried.  Tears flowed down hercheeks.  I became quite frantic.  She wiped them away, withoutattempting to conceal them.  ""You know my aunt,"" she continued;""she was present: and in what light does she consider the affair!Last night, and this morning, Werther, I was compelled to listento a lecture upon my, acquaintance with you.  I have been obligedto hear you condemned and depreciated; and I could not -- I darednot -- say much in your defence.""

ííííEvery word she uttered was a dagger to my heart.  She did not feelwhat a mercy it would have been to conceal everything from me.She told me, in addition, all the impertinence that would be furthercirculated, and how the malicious would triumph; how they wouldrejoice over the punishment of my pride, over my humiliation forthat want of esteem for others with which I had often been reproached.To hear all this, Wilhelm, uttered by her in a voice of the mostsincere sympathy, awakened all my passions; and I am still in astate of extreme excitement.  I wish I could find a man to jeerme about this event.  I would sacrifice him to my resentment.  Thesight of his blood might possibly be a relief to my fury.  A hundredtimes have I seized a dagger, to give ease to this oppressed heart.Naturalists tell of a noble race of horses that instinctively opena vein with their teeth, when heated and exhausted by a long course,in order to breathe more freely.  I am often tempted to open avein, to procure for myself everlasting liberty.

ííííMARCH 24.

ííííI have tendered my resignation to the court.  I hope it will beaccepted, and you will forgive me for not having previously consultedyou.  It is necessary I should leave this place.  I know all youwill urge me to stay, and therefore I beg you will soften thisnews to my mother.  I am unable to do anything for myself: how,then, should I be competent to assist others?  It will afflict herthat I should have interrupted that career which would have mademe first a privy councillor, and then minister, and that I shouldlook behind me, in place of advancing.  Argue as you will, combineall the reasons which should have induced me to remain, I am going:that is sufficient.  But, that you may not be ignorant of mydestination, I may mention that the Prince of -- is here.  He ismuch pleased with my company; and, having heard of my intentionto resign, he has invited me to his country house, to pass thespring months with him. I shall be left completely my own master;and, as we agree on all subjects but one, I shall try my fortune,and accompany him.

ííííAPRIL l9.

ííííThanks for both your letters.  I delayed my reply, and withheldthis letter, till I should obtain an answer from the court.  Ifeared my mother might apply to the minister to defeat my purpose.But my request is granted, my resignation is accepted.  I shallnot recount with what reluctance it was accorded, nor relate whatthe minister has written: you would only renew your lamentations.The crown prince has sent me a present of five and twenty ducats;and, indeed, such goodness has affected me to tears.  For thisreason I shall not require from my mother the money for which Ilately applied.

ííííMAY 5.

ííííI leave this place to-morrow; and, as my native place is only sixmiles from the high road, I intend to visit it once more, andrecall the happy dreams of my childhood.  I shall enter at thesame gate through which I came with my mother, when, after myfather's death, she left that delightful retreat to immure herselfin your melancholy town.  Adieu, my dear friend: you shall hear ofmy future career.

ííííMAY 9.

ííííI have paid my visit to my native place with all the devotion ofa pilgrim, and have experienced many unexpected emotions.  Nearthe great elm tree, which is a quarter of a league from the village,I got out of the carriage, and sent it on before, that alone, andon foot, I might enjoy vividly and heartily all the pleasure ofmy recollections.  I stood there under that same elm which wasformerly the term and object of my walks.  How things have sincechanged!  Then, in happy ignorance, I sighed for a world I did notknow, where I hoped to find every pleasure and enjoyment which myheart could desire; and now, on my return from that wide world, Omy friend, how many disappointed hopes and unsuccessful plans haveI brought back!

ííííAs I contemplated the mountains which lay stretched out before me,I thought how often they had been the object of my dearest desires.Here used I to sit for hours together with my eyes bent upon them,ardently longing to wander in the shade of those woods, to losemyself in those valleys, which form so delightful an object in thedistance.  With what reluctance did I leave this charming spot;when my hour of recreation was over, and my leave of absenceexpired!  I drew near to the village: all the well-known oldsummerhouses and gardens were recognised again; I disliked the newones, and all other alterations which had taken place.  I enteredthe village, and all my former feelings returned.  I cannot, mydear friend, enter into details, charming as were my sensations:they would be dull in the narration.  I had intended to lodge inthe market-place, near our old house.  As soon as I entered, Iperceived that the schoolroom, where our childhood had been taughtby that good old woman, was converted into a shop.  I called tomind the sorrow, the heaviness, the tears, and oppression of heart,which I experienced in that confinement.  Every step produced someparticular impression.  A pilgrim in the Holy Land does not meetso many spots pregnant with tender recollections, and his soul ishardly moved with greater devotion.  One incident will serve forillustration.  I followed the course of a stream to a farm, formerlya delightful walk of mine, and paused at the spot, where, whenboys, we used to amuse ourselves making ducks and drakes upon thewater.  I recollected so well how I used formerly to watch thecourse of that same stream, following it with inquiring eagerness,forming romantic ideas of the countries it was to pass through;but my imagination was soon exhausted: while the water continuedflowing farther and farther on, till my fancy became bewilderedby the contemplation of an invisible distance.  Exactly such, mydear friend, so happy and so confined, were the thoughts of ourgood ancestors.  Their feelings and their poetry were fresh aschildhood.  And, when Ulysses talks of the immeasurable sea andboundless earth, his epithets are true, natural, deeply felt, andmysterious.  Of what importance is it that I have learned, withevery schoolboy, that the world is round?  Man needs but littleearth for enjoyment, and still less for his final repose.

ííííI am at present with the prince at his hunting lodge.  He is a manwith whom one can live happily. He is honest and unaffected.  Thereare, however, some strange characters about him, whom I cannot atall understand.  They do not seem vicious, and yet they do notcarry the appearance of thoroughly honest men.  Sometimes I amdisposed to believe them honest, and yet I cannot persuade myselfto confide in them.  It grieves me to hear the prince occasionallytalk of things which he has only read or heard of, and always withthe same view in which they have been represented by others.

ííííHe values my understanding and talents more highly than my heart,but I am proud of the latter only.  It is the sole source ofeverything of our strength, happiness, and misery.  All the knowledgeI possess every one else can acquire, but my heart is exclusivelymy own.

ííííMAY 25.

ííííI have had a plan in my head of which I did not intend to speakto you until it was accomplished: now that it has failed, I mayas well mention it.  I wished to enter the army, and had long beendesirous of taking the step.  This, indeed, was the chief reasonfor my coming here with the prince, as he is a general in theservice.  I communicated my design to him during one of our walkstogether.  He disapproved of it, and it would have been actualmadness not to have listened to his reasons.

ííííJUNE 11.

ííííSay what you will, I can remain here no longer.  Why should Iremain?  Time hangs heavy upon my hands.  The prince is as graciousto me as any one could be, and yet I am not at my ease.  There is,indeed, nothing in common between us.  He is a man of understanding,but quite of the ordinary kind.  His conversation affords me nomore amusement than I should derive from the perusal of a well-writtenbook.  I shall remain here a week Ionger, and then start again onmy travels.  My drawings are the best things I have done since Icame here.  The prince has a taste for the arts, and would improveif his mind were not fettered by cold rules and mere technicalideas.  I often lose patience, when, with a glowing imagination,I am giving expression to art and nature, he interferes with learnedsuggestions, and uses at random the technical phraseology of artists.

ííííJULY 16.

ííííOnce more I am a wanderer, a pilgrim, through the world.  But whatelse are you!

ííííJULY 18.

ííííWhither am I going?  I will tell you in confidence. I am obligedto continue a fortnight longer here, and then I think it would bebetter for me to visit the mines in --.  But I am only deludingmyself thus.  The fact is, I wish to be near Charlotte again, thatis all.  I smile at the suggestions of my heart, and obey itsdictates.

ííííJULY 29.

ííííNo, no! it is yet well all is well!  I her husband!  O God, whogave me being, if thou hadst destined this happiness for me, mywhole life would have been one continual thanksgiving!  But I willnot murmur -- forgive these tears, forgive these fruitless wishes.She -- my wife!  Oh, the very thought of folding that dearest ofHeaven's creatures in my arms!  Dear Wilhelm, my whole frame feelsconvulsed when I see Albert put his arms around her slender waist!

ííííAnd shall I avow it?  Why should I not, Wilhelm?  She would havebeen happier with me than with him.  Albert is not the man tosatisfy the wishes of such a heart.  He wants a certain sensibility;he wants -- in short, their hearts do not beat in unison.  Howoften, my dear friend, im reading a passage from some interestingbook, when my heart and Charlotte's seemed to meet, and in a hundredother instances when our sentiments were unfolded by the story ofsome fictitious character, have I felt that we were made for eachother!  But, dear Wilhelm, he loves her with his whole soul; andwhat does not such a love deserve?

ííííI have been interrupted by an insufferable visit.  I have driedmy tears, and composed my thoughts.  Adieu, my best friend!

ííííAUGUST 4.

ííííI am not alone unfortunate.  All men are disappointed in theirhopes, and deceived in their expectations.  I have paid a visitto my good old woman under the lime-trees.  The eldest boy ranout to meet me: his exclamation of joy brought out his mother,but she had a very melancholy look.  Her first word was, ""Alas!dear sir, my little John is dead.""  He was the youngest of herchildren.  I was silent.  ""And my husband has returned fromSwitzerland without any money; and, if some kind people had notassisted him, he must have begged his way home.  He was taken illwith fever on his journey.""  I could answer nothing, but made thelittle one a present.  She invited me to take some fruit: I complied,and left the place with a sorrowful heart.

ííííAUGUST 21.

ííííMy sensations are constantly changing.  Sometimes a happy prospectopens before me; but alas! it is only for a moment; and then, whenI am lost in reverie, I cannot help saying to myself, ""If Albertwere to die? -- Yes, she would become -- and I should be"" -- andso I pursue a chimera, till it leads me to the edge of a precipiceat which I shudder.

ííííWhen I pass through the same gate, and walk along the same roadwhich first conducted me to Charlotte, my heart sinks within meat the change that has since taken place.  All, all, is altered!No sentiment, no pulsation of my heart, is the same.  My sensationsare such as would occur to some departed prince whose spirit shouldreturn to visit the superb palace which he had built in happy times,adorned with costly magnificence, and left to a beloved son, butwhose glory he should find departed, and its halls deserted andin ruins.

ííííSEPTEMBER 3.

ííííI sometimes cannot understand how she can love another, how shedares love another, when I love nothing in this world so completely,so devotedly, as I love her, when I know only her, and have noother possession.

ííííSEPTEMBER 4.

ííííIt is even so!  As nature puts on her autumn tints it becomesautumn with me and around me.  My leaves are sere and yellow, andthe neighbouring trees are divested of their foliage.  Do youremember my writing to you about a peasant boy shortly after myarrival here?  I have just made inquiries about him in Walheim.They say he has been dismissed from his service, and is now avoidedby every one.  I met him yesterday on the road, going to aneighbouring village.  I spoke to him, and he told me his story.It interested me exceedingly, as you will easily understand whenI repeat it to you.  But why should I trouble you?  Why should Inot reserve all my sorrow for myself?  Why should I continue togive you occasion to pity and blame me?  But no matter: this alsois part of my destiny.

ííííAt first the peasant lad answered my inquiries with a sort ofsubdued melancholy, which seemed to me the mark of a timid disposition;but, as we grew to understand each other, he spoke with less reserve,and openly confessed his faults, and lamented his misfortune.  Iwish, my dear friend, I could give proper expression to hislanguage.  He told me with a sort of pleasurable recollection,that, after my departure, his passion for his mistress increaseddaily, until at last he neither knew what he did nor what he said,nor what was to become of him.  He could neither eat nor drink norsleep: he felt a sense of suffocation; he disobeyed all orders,and forgot all commands involuntarily; he seemed as if pursued byan evil spirit, till one day, knowing that his mistress had goneto an upper chamber, he had followed, or, rather, been drawn afterher.  As she proved deaf to his entreaties, he had recourse toviolence.  He knows not what happened; but he called God to witnessthat his intentions to her were honourable, and that he desirednothing more sincerely than that they should marry, and pass theirlives together.  When he had come to this point, he began tohesitate, as if there was something which he had not courage toutter, till at length he acknowledged with some confusion certainlittle confidences she had encouraged, and liberties she had allowed.He broke off two or three times in his narration, and assured memost earnestly that he had no wish to make her bad, as he termedit, for he loved her still as sincerely as ever; that the talehad never before escaped his lips, and was only now told to convinceme that he was not utterly lost and abandoned.  And here, my dearfriend, I must commence the old song which you know I utter eternally.If I could only represent the man as he stood, and stands nowbefore me, could I only give his true expressions, you would feelcompelled to sympathise in his fate.  But enough: you, who know mymisfortune and my disposition, can easily comprehend the attractionwhich draws me toward every unfortunate being, but particularlytoward him whose story I have recounted.

ííííOn perusing this letter a second time, I find I have omitted theconclusion of my tale; but it is easily supplied.  She becamereserved toward him, at the instigation of her brother who hadlong hated him, and desired his expulsion from the house, fearingthat his sister's second marriage might deprive his children ofthe handsome fortune they expected from her; as she is childless.He was dismissed at length; and the whole affair occasioned somuch scandal, that the mistress dared not take him back, even ifshe had wished it.  She has since hired another servant, with whom,they say, her brother is equally displeased, and whom she is likelyto marry; but my informant assures me that he himself is determinednot to survive such a catastrophe.

ííííThis story is neither exaggerated nor embellished: indeed, I haveweakened and impaired it in the narration, by the necessity ofusing the more refined expressions of society.

ííííThis love, then, this constancy, this passion, is no poeticalfiction.  It is actual, and dwells in its greatest purity amongstthat class of mankind whom we term rude, uneducated.  We are theeducated, not the perverted.  But read this story with attention,I implore you.  I am tranquil to-day, for I have been employedupon this narration: you see by my writing that I am not so agitatedas usual.  I read and re-read this tale, Wilhelm: it is the historyof your friend!  My fortune has been and will be similar; and Iam neither half so brave nor half so determined as the poor wretchwith whom I hesitate to compare myself.

ííííSEPTEMBER 5.

ííííCharlotte had written a letter to her husband in the country, wherehe was detained by business.  It commenced, ""My dearest love,return as soon as possible: I await you with a thousand raptures.""A friend who arrived, brought word, that, for certain reasons, hecould not return immediately.  Charlotte's letter was not forwarded,and the same evening it fell into my hands.  I read it, and smiled.She asked the reason. ""What a heavenly treasure is imagination:""I exclaimed; ""I fancied for a moment that this was written to me.""She paused, and seemed displeased.  I was silent.

ííííSEPTEMBER 6.

ííííIt cost me much to part with the blue coat which I wore the firsttime I danced with Charlotte.  But I could not possibly wear itany longer.  But I have ordered a new one, precisely similar, evento the collar and sleeves, as well as a new waistcoat and pantaloons.

ííííBut it does not produce the same effect upon me.  I know not howit is, but I hope in time I shall like it better.

ííííSEPTEMBER 12.

ííííShe has been absent for some days.  She went to meet Albert.To-day I visited her: she rose to receive me, and I kissed herhand most tenderly.

ííííA canary at the moment flew from a mirror, and settled upon hershoulder.  ""Here is a new friend,"" she observed, while she madehim perch upon her hand: ""he is a present for the children.  Whata dear he is!  Look at him!  When I feed him, he flutters with hiswings, and pecks so nicely.  He kisses me, too, only look!""

ííííShe held the bird to her mouth; and he pressed her sweet lips withso much fervour that he seemed to feel the excess of bliss whichhe enjoyed.

íííí""He shall kiss you too,"" she added; and then she held the birdtoward me.  His little beak moved from her mouth to mine, and thedelightful sensation seemed like the forerunner of the sweetestbliss.

íííí""A kiss,"" I observed, ""does not seem to satisfy him: he wishes forfood, and seems disappointed by these unsatisfactory endearments.""

íííí""But he eats out of my mouth,"" she continued, and extended herlips to him containing seed; and she smiled with all the charm ofa being who has allowed an innocent participation of her love.

ííííI turned my face away.  She should not act thus. She ought not toexcite my imagination with such displays of heavenly innocence andhappiness, nor awaken my heart from its slumbers, in which itdreams of the worthlessness of life!  And why not?  Because sheknows how much I love her.

ííííSEPTEMBER 15.

ííííIt makes me wretched, Wilhelm, to think that there should be menincapable of appreciating the few things which possess a real valuein life.  You remember the walnut trees at S--, under which I usedto sit with Charlotte, during my visits to the worthy old vicar.Those glorious trees, the very sight of which has so often filledmy heart with joy, how they adorned and refreshed the parsonageyard, with their wide-extended branches! and how pleasing was ourremembrance of the good old pastor, by whose hands they wereplanted so many years ago: The schoolmaster has frequently mentionedhis name.  He had it from his grandfather.  He must have been amost excellent man; and, under the shade of those old trees, hismemory was ever venerated by me.  The schoolmaster informed usyesterday, with tears in his eyes, that those trees had been felled.Yes, cut to the ground!  I could, in my wrath, have slain themonster who struck the first stroke.  And I must endure this! --I, who, if I had had two such trees in my own court, and one haddied from old age, should have wept with real affliction.  Butthere is some comfort left, such a thing is sentiment, the wholevillage murmurs at the misfortune; and I hope the vicar's wifewill soon find, by the cessation of the villagers' presents, howmuch she has wounded the feelings of the neighborhhood.  It wasshe who did it, the wife of the present incumbent (our good oldman is dead), a tall, sickly creature who is so far right todisregard the world, as the world totally disregards her.  Thesilly being affects to be learned, pretends to examine the canonicalbooks, lends her aid toward the new-fashioned reformation ofChristendom, moral and critical, and shrugs up her shoulders atthe mention of Lavater's enthusiasm.  Her health is destroyed, onaccount of which she is prevented from having any enjoyment herebelow.  Only such a creature could have cut down my walnut trees!I can never pardon it.  Hear her reasons.  The falling leaves madethe court wet and dirty; the branches obstructed the light; boysthrew stones at the nuts when they were ripe, and the noise affectedher nerves; and disturbed her profound meditations, when she wasweighing the diffculties of Kennicot, Semler, and Michaelis.Finding that all the parish, particularly the old people, weredispleased, I asked ""why they allowed it?""  ""Ah, sir!"" they replied,""when the steward orders, what can we poor peasants do?""  But onething has happened well.  The steward and the vicar (who, for once,thought to reap some advantage from the caprices of his wife)intended to divide the trees between them.  The revenue-office,being informed of it, revived an old claim to the ground where thetrees had stood, and sold them to the best bidder.  There theystill lie on the ground.  If I were the sovereign, I should knowhow to deal with them all, vicar, steward, and revenue-office.Sovereign, did I say?  I should, in that case, care little aboutthe trees that grew in the country.

ííííOCTOBER 10.

ííííOnly to gaze upon her dark eyes is to me a source of happiness!And what grieves me, is, that Albert does not seem so happy as he-- hoped to be -- as I should have been -- if -- I am no friendto these pauses, but here I cannot express it otherwise; andprobably I am explicit enough.

ííííOCTOBER 12.

ííííOssian has superseded Homer in my heart.  To what a world doesthe illustrious bard carry me!  To wander over pathless wilds,surrounded by impetuous whirlwinds, where, by the feeble lightof the moon, we see the spirits of our ancestors; to hear fromthe mountain-tops, mid the roar of torrents, their plaintivesounds issuing from deep caverns, and the sorrowful lamentationsof a maiden who sighs and expires on the mossy tomb of the warriorby whom she was adored.  I meet this bard with silver hair; hewanders in the valley; he seeks the footsteps of his fathers, and,alas! he finds only their tombs.  Then, contemplating the palemoon, as she sinks beneath the waves of the rolling sea, the memoryof bygone days strikes the mind of the hero, days when approachingdanger invigorated the brave, and the moon shone upon his barkladen with spoils, and returning in triumph.  When I read in hiscountenance deep sorrow, when I see his dying glory sink exhaustedinto the grave, as he inhales new and heart-thrilling delightfrom his approaching union with his beloved, and he casts a lookon the cold earth and the tall grass which is so soon to cover him,and then exclaims, ""The traveller will come, -- he will come whohas seen my beauty, and he will ask, 'Where is the bard, where isthe illustrious son of Fingal?'  He will walk over my tomb, andwill seek me in vain!""  Then, O my friend, I could instantly, likea true and noble knight, draw my sword, and deliver my prince fromthe long and painful languor of a living death, and dismiss my ownsoul to follow the demigod whom my hand had set free!

ííííOCTOBER 19.

ííííAlas! the void the fearful void, which I feel in my bosom!  SometimesI think, if I could only once but once, press her to my heart, thisdreadful void would be filled.

ííííOCTOBER 26.

ííííYes, I feel certain, Wilhelm, and every day I become more certain,that the existence of any being whatever is of very little consequence.A friend of Charlotte's called to see her just now.  I withdrewinto a neighbouring apartment, and took up a book; but, finding Icould not read, I sat down to write.  I heard them converse in anundertone: they spoke upon indifferent topics, and retailed thenews of the town.  One was going to be married; another was ill,very ill, she had a dry cough, her face was growing thinner daily,and she had occasional fits.  ""N-- is very unwell too,"" saidCharlotte.  ""His limbs begin to swell already,"" answered the other;and my lively imagination carried me at once to the beds of theinfirm.  There I see them struggling against death, with all theagonies of pain and horror; and these women, Wilhelm, talk of allthis with as much indifference as one would mention the death ofa stranger.  And when I look around the apartment where I now am-- when I see Charlotte's apparel lying before me, and Albert'swritings, and all those articles of furniture which are so familiarto me, even to the very inkstand which I am using, -- when I thinkwhat I am to this family -- everything.  My friends esteem me; I oftencontribute to their happiness, and my heart seems as if it couldnot beat without them; and yet --- if I were to die, if I wereto be summoned from the midst of this circle, would they feel --or how long would they feel the void which my loss would make intheir existence?  How long!  Yes, such is the frailty of man, thateven there, where he has the greatest consciousness of his ownbeing, where he makes the strongest and most forcible impression,even in the memory, in the heart, of his beloved, there also hemust perish, -- vanish, -- and that quickly.

ííííOCTOBER 27.

ííííI could tear open my bosom with vexation to think how little weare capable of influencing the feelings of each other.  No onecan communicate to me those sensations of love, joy, rapture, anddelight which I do not naturally possess; and, though my heart mayglow with the most lively affection, I cannot make the happinessof one in whom the same warmth is not inherent.

ííííOCTOBER 27: Evening.

ííííI possess so much, but my love for her absorbs it all.  I possessso much, but without her I have nothing.

ííííOCTOBER 30.

ííííOne hundred times have I been on the point of embracing her.Heavens! what a torment it is to see so much loveliness passingand repassing before us, and yet not dare to lay hold of it!And laying hold is the most natural of human instincts.  Do notchildren touch everything they see?  And I!

ííííNOVEMBER 3.

ííííWitness, Heaven, how often I lie down in my bed with a wish, andeven a hope, that I may never awaken again.  And in the morning,when I open my eyes, I behold the sun once more, and am wretched.If I were whimsical, I might blame the weather, or an acquaintance,or some personal disappointment, for my discontented mind; and thenthis insupportable load of trouble would not rest entirely uponmyself.  But, alas!  I feel it too sadly.  I am alone the causeof my own woe, am I not?  Truly, my own bosom contains the sourceof all my sorrow, as it previously contained the source of all mypleasure.  Am I not the same being who once enjoyed an excess ofhappiness, who, at every step, saw paradise open before him, andwhose heart was ever expanded toward the whole world?  And thisheart is now dead, no sentiment can revive it; my eyes are dry;and my senses, no more refreshed by the influence of soft tears,wither and consume my brain.  I suffer much, for I have lost theonly charm of life: that active, sacred power which created worldsaround me, -- it is no more.  When I look from my window at thedistant hills, and behold the morning sun breaking through themists, and illuminating the country around, which is still wrappedin silence, whilst the soft stream winds gently through the willows,which have shed their leaves; when glorious nature displays allher beauties before me, and her wondrous prospects are ineffectualto extract one tear of joy from my withered heart, I feel that insuch a moment I stand like a reprobate before heaven, hardened,insensible, and unmoved.  Oftentimes do I then bend my knee to theearth, and implore God for the blessing of tears, as the despondinglabourer in some scorching climate prays for the dews of heavento moisten his parched corn.

ííííBut I feel that God does not grant sunshine or rain to ourimportunate entreaties.  And oh, those bygone days, whose memorynow torments me! why were they so fortunate?  Because I thenwaited with patience for the blessings of the Eternal, and receivedhis gifts with the grateful feelings of a thankful heart.

ííííNOVEMBER 8.

ííííCharlotte has reproved me for my excesses, with so much tendernessand goodness!  I have lately been in the habit of drinking morewine than heretofore.  ""Don't do it,"" she said.  ""Think of Charlotte!""""Think of you!"" I answered; ""need you bid me do so?  Think of you-- I do not think of you: you are ever before my soul!  This verymorning I sat on the spot where, a few days ago, you descendedfrom the carriage, and--""  She immediately changed the subject toprevent me from pursuing it farther.  My dear friend, my energiesare all prostrated: she can do with me what she pleases.

ííííNOVEMBER 15.

ííííI thank you, Wilhelm, for your cordial sympathy, for your excellentadvice; and I implore you to be quiet.  Leave me to my sufferings.In spite of my wretchedness, I have still strength enough forendurance.  I revere religion -- you know I do.  I feel that itcan impart strength to the feeble and comfort to the afflicted,but does it affect all men equally?  Consider this vast universe:you will see thousands for whom it has never existed, thousandsfor whom it will never exist, whether it be preached to them, ornot; and must it, then, necessarily exist for me?  Does not theSon of God himself say that they are his whom the Father has givento him?  Have I been given to him?  What if the Father will retainme for himself, as my heart sometimes suggests?  I pray you, donot misinterpret this.  Do not extract derision from my harmlesswords.  I pour out my whole soul before you.  Silence were otherwisepreferable to me, but I need not shrink from a subject of whichfew know more than I do myself.  What is the destiny of man, butto fill up the measure of his sufferings, and to drink his allottedcup of bitterness?  And if that same cup proved bitter to the Godof heaven, under a human form, why should I affect a foolish pride,and call it sweet?  Why should I be ashamed of shrinking at thatfearful moment, when my whole being will tremble between existenceand annihilation, when a remembrance of the past, like a flash oflightning, will illuminate the dark gulf of futurity, when everythingshall dissolve around me, and the whole world vanish away?  Is notthis the voice of a creature oppressed beyond all resource,self-deficient, about to plunge into inevitable destruction, andgroaning deeply at its inadequate strength, ""My God! my God! whyhast thou forsaken me?""  And should I feel ashamed to utter thesame expression?  Should I not shudder at a prospect which had itsfears, even for him who folds up the heavens like a garment?

ííííNOVEMBER 21.

ííííShe does not feel, she does not know, that she is preparing a poisonwhich will destroy us both; and I drink deeply of the draught whichis to prove my destruction.  What mean those looks of kindness withwhich she often -- often? no, not often, but sometimes, regards me,that complacency with which she hears the involuntary sentimentswhich frequently escape me, and the tender pity for my sufferingswhich appears in her countenance?

ííííYesterday, when I took leave she seized me by the hand, and said,""Adieu, dear Werther.""  Dear Werther!  It was the first time sheever called me dear: the sound sunk deep into my heart.  I haverepeated it a hundred times; and last night, on going to bed, andtalking to myself of various things, I suddenly said, ""Good night,dear Werther!"" and then could not but laugh at myself.

ííííNOVEMBER 22

ííííI cannot pray, ""Leave her to me !"" and yet she often seems tobelong to me.  I cannot pray, ""Give her to me!"" for she isanother's.  In this way I affect mirth over my troubles; and,if I had time, I could compose a whole litany of antitheses.

ííííNOVEMBER 24.

ííííShe is sensible of my sufferings.  This morning her look piercedmy very soul.  I found her alone, and she was silent: she steadfastlysurveyed me.  I no longer saw in her face the charms of beauty orthe fire of genius: these had disappeared.  But I was affected byan expression much more touching, a look of the deepest sympathyand of the softest pity.  Why was I afraid to throw myself at herfeet?  Why did I not dare to take her in my arms, and answer herby a thousand kisses?  She had recourse to her piano for relief,and in a low and sweet voice accompanied the music with delicioussounds.  Her lips never appeared so lovely: they seemed but justto open, that they might imbibe the sweet tones which issued fromthe instrument, and return the heavenly vibration from her lovelymouth.  Oh! who can express my sensations?  I was quite overcome,and, bending down, pronounced this vow: ""Beautiful lips, which theangels guard, never will I seek to profane your purity with a kiss.""And yet, my friend, oh, I wish -- but my heart is darkened by doubtand indecision -- could I but taste felicity, and then die to expiatethe sin!  What sin?

ííííNOVEMBER 26.

ííííOftentimes I say to myself, ""Thou alone art wretched: all othermortals are happy, none are distressed like thee!""  Then I reada passage in an ancient poet, and I seem to understand my ownheart.  I have so much to endure!  Have men before me ever beenso wretched?

ííííNOVEMBER 30.

ííííI shall never be myself again!  Wherever I go, some fatality occursto distract me.  Even to-day alas -- for our destiny! alas forhuman nature!

ííííAbout dinner-time I went to walk by the river-side, for I had noappetite.  Everything around seemed gloomy: a cold and damp easterlywind blew from the mountains, and black, heavy clouds spread overthe plain.  I observed at a distance a man in a tattered coat: hewas wandering among the rocks, and seemed to be looking for plants.When I approached, he turned round at the noise; and I saw thathe had an interesting countenance in which a settled melancholy,strongly marked by benevolence, formed the principal feature.His long black hair was divided, and flowed over his shoulders.As his garb betokened a person of the lower order, I thought hewould not take it ill if I inquired about his business; and Itherefore asked what he was seeking.  He replied, with a deep sigh,that he was looking for flowers, and could find none.  ""But it isnot the season,"" I observed, with a smile.  ""Oh, there are so manyflowers!"" he answered, as he came nearer to me.  ""In my gardenthere are roses and honeysuckles of two sorts: one sort was givento me by my father! they grow as plentifully as weeds; I have beenlooking for them these two days, and cannot find them.  There areflowers out there, yellow, blue, and red; and that centaury has avery pretty blossom: but I can find none of them.""  I observed hispeculiarity, and therefore asked him, with an air of indifference,what he intended to do with his flowers.  A strange smile overspreadhis countenance.  Holding his finger to his mouth, he expressed ahope that I would not betray him; and he then informed me that hehad promised to gather a nosegay for his mistress.  ""That is right,""said I.  ""Oh!"" he replied, ""she possesses many other things aswell: she is very rich.""  ""And yet,"" I continued, ""she likes yournosegays.""  ""Oh, she has jewels and crowns!"" he exclaimed.  I askedwho she was.  ""If the states-general would but pay me,"" he added,""I should be quite another man. Alas! there was a time when I wasso happy; but that is past, and I am now--""  He raised his swimmingeyes to heaven.  ""And you were happy once?""  I observed.  ""Ah,would I were so still!"" was his reply.  ""I was then as gay andcontented as a man can be.""  An old woman, who was coming towardus, now called out, ""Henry, Henry! where are you?  We have beenlooking for you everywhere: come to dinner.""  ""Is he your son?""I inquired, as I went toward her. ""Yes,"" she said: ""he is my poor,unfortunate son.  The Lord has sent me a heavy affliction.""  I askedwhether he had been long in this state.  She answered, ""He has beenas calm as he is at present for about six months.  I thank Heaventhat he has so far recovered: he was for one whole year quite raving,and chained down in a madhouse.  Now he injures no one, but talksof nothing else than kings and queens.  He used to be a very good,quiet youth, and helped to maintain me; he wrote a very fine hand;but all at once he became melancholy, was seized with a violentfever, grew distracted, and is now as you see.  If I were only totell you, sir--""  I interrupted her by asking what period it wasin which he boasted of having been so happy.  ""Poor boy!"" sheexclaimed, with a smile of cormpassion, ""he means the time whenhe was completely deranged, a time he never ceases to regret,when he was in the madhouse, and unconscious of everything.""  Iwas thunderstruck: I placed a piece of money in her hand, andhastened away.

íííí""You were happy!""  I exclaimed, as I returned quickly to thetown, ""'as gay and contented as a man can be!'""  God of heaven!and is this the destiny of man?  Is he only happy before he hasacquired his reason, or after he has lost it?  Unfortunate being!And yet I envy your fate: I envy the delusion to which you are avictim.  You go forth with joy to gather flowers for your princess,-- in winter, -- and grieve when you can find none, and cannotunderstand why they do not grow.  But I wander forth without joy,without hope, without design; and I return as I came.  You fancywhat a man you would be if the states general paid you.  Happymortal, who can ascribe your wretchedness to an earthly cause!You do not know, you do not feel, that in your own distractedheart and disordered brain dwells the source of that unhappinesswhich all the potentates on earth cannot relieve.

ííííLet that man die unconsoled who can deride the invalid for undertakinga journey to distant, healthful springs, where he often finds onlya heavier disease and a more painful death, or who can exult overthe despairing mind of a sinner, who, to obtain peace of conscienceand an alleviation of misery, makes a pilgrimage to the HolySepulchre.  Each laborious step which galls his wounded feet inrough and untrodden paths pours a drop of balm into his troubledsoul, and the journey of many a weary day brings a nightly reliefto his anguished heart.  Will you dare call this enthusiasm, yecrowd of pompous declaimers?  Enthusiasm!  0 God! thou seest mytears.  Thou hast allotted us our portion of misery: must we alsohave brethren to persecute us, to deprive us of our consolation,of our trust in thee, and in thy love and mercy?  For our trust inthe virtue of the healing root, or in the strength of the vine,what is it else than a belief in thee from whom all that surroundsus derives its healing and restoring powers?  Father, whom I knownot, -- who wert once wont to fill my soul, but who now hidest thyface from me, -- call me back to thee; be silent no longer; thysilence shall not delay a soul which thirsts after thee.  What man,what father, could be angry with a son for returning to him suddenly,for falling on his neck, and exclaiming, ""I am here again, myfather! forgive me if I have anticipated my journey, and returnedbefore the appointed time!  The world is everywhere the same, --a scene of labour and pain, of pleasure and reward; but what doesit all avail?  I am happy only where thou art, and in thy presenceam I content to suffer or enjoy.""  And wouldst thou, heavenly Father,banish such a child from thy presence?

ííííDECEMBER 1.

ííííWilhelm, the man about whom I wrote to you -- that man so enviablein his misfortunes -- was secretary to Charlotte's father; and anunhappy passion for her which he cherished, concealed, and atlength discovered, caused him to be dismissed from his situation.This made him mad.  Think, whilst you peruse this plain narration,what an impression the circumstance has made upon me!  But it wasrelated to me by Albert with as much calmness as you will probablyperuse it.

ííííDECEMBER 4.

ííííI implore your attention.  It is all over with me.  I can supportthis state no longer.  To-day I was sitting by Charlotte.  She wasplaying upon her piano a succession of delightful melodies, withsuch intense expression!  Her little sister was dressing her dollupon my lap.  The tears came into my eyes.  I leaned down, andlooked intently at her wedding-ring: my tears fell -- immediatelyshe began to play that favourite, that divine, air which has sooften enchanted me.  I felt comfort from a recollection of thepast, of those bygone days when that air was familiar to me; andthen I recalled all the sorrows and the disappointments which Ihad since endured.  I paced with hasty strides through the room,my heart became convulsed with painful emotions.  At length Iwent up to her, and exclaimed With eagerness, ""For Heaven's sake,play that air no longer!""  She stopped, and looked steadfastly atme.  She then said, with a smile which sunk deep into my heart,""Werther, you are ill: your dearest food is distasteful to you.But go, I entreat you, and endeavour to compose yourself.""  Itore myself away.  God, thou seest my torments, and wilt end them!

ííííDECEMBER 6.

ííííHow her image haunts me!  Waking or asleep, she fills my entiresoul!  Soon as I close my eyes, here, in my brain, where all thenerves of vision are concentrated, her dark eyes are imprinted.Here -- I do not know how to describe it; but, if I shut my eyes,hers are immediately before me: dark as an abyss they open uponme, and absorb my senses.

ííííAnd what is man -- that boasted demigod?  Do not his powers failwhen he most requires their use?  And whether he soar in joy, orsink in sorrow, is not his career in both inevitably arrested?And, whilst he fondly dreams that he is grasping at infinity,does he not feel compelled to return to a consciousness of hiscold, monotonous existence?

ííííTHE EDITOR TO THE READER.

ííííIt is a matter of extreme regret that we want original evidenceof the last remarkable days of our friend; and we are, therefore,obliged to interrupt the progress of his correspondence, and tosupply the deficiency by a connected narration.

ííííI have felt it my duty to collect accurate information from themouths of persons well acquainted with his history.  The storyis simple; and all the accounts agree, except in some unimportantparticulars.  It is true, that, with respect to the characters ofthe persons spoken of, opinions and judgments vary.

ííííWe have only, then, to relate conscientiously the facts which ourdiligent labour has enabled us to collect, to give the lettersof the deceased, and to pay particular attention to the slightestfragment from his pen, more especially as it is so difficult todiscover the real and correct motives of men who are not of thecommon order.

ííííSorrow and discontent had taken deep root in Werther's soul, andgradually imparted their character to his whole being.  The harmonyof his mind became completely disturbed; a perpetual excitementand mental irritation, which weakened his natural powers, producedthe saddest etfects upon him, and rendered him at length the victimof an exhaustion against which he struggled with still more painfulefforts than he had displayed, even in contending with his othermisfortunes.  His mental anxiety weakened his various good qualities;and he was soon converted into a gloomy companion, always unhappyand unjust in his ideas, the more  wretched he became.  This was,at least, the opinion of Albert's friends.  They assert, moreover,that the character of Albert himself had undergone no change inthe meantime: he was still the same being whom Werther had loved,honoured, and respected from the commencement.  His love forCharlotte was unbounded: he was proud of her, and desired thatshe should be recognised by every one as the noblest of createdbeings.  Was he, however, to blame for wishing to avert from herevery appearance of suspicion? or for his unwillingness to sharehis rich prize with another, even for a moment, and in the mostinnocent manner?  It is asserted that Albert frequently retiredfrom his wife's apartment during Werther's visits; but this didnot arise from hatred or aversion to his friend, but only from afeeling that his presence was oppressive to Werther.

ííííCharlotte's father, who was confined to the house by indisposition,was accustomed to send his carriage for her, that she might makeexcursions in the neighbourhood.  One day the weather had beenunusually severe, and the whole country was covered with snow.

ííííWerther went for Charlotte the following morning, in order that,if Albert were absent, he might conduct her home.

ííííThe beautiful weather produced but little impression on his troubledspirit.  A heavy weight lay upon his soul, deep melancholy hadtaken possession of him, and his mind knew no change save from onepainful thought to another.

ííííAs he now never enjoyed internal peace, the condition of his fellowcreatures was to him a perpetual source of trouble and distress.He believed he had disturbed the happiness of Albert and his wife;and, whilst he censured himself strongly for this, he began toentertain a secret dislike to Albert.

ííííHis thoughts were occasionally directed to this point.  ""Yes,"" hewould repeat to himself, with ill-concealed dissatisfaction, ""yes,this is, after all, the extent of that confiding, dear, tender,and sympathetic love, that calm and eternal fidelity!  What do Ibehold but satiety and indifference?  Does not every frivolousengagement attract him more than his charming and lovely wife?Does he know how to prize his happiness?  Can he value her as shedeserves?  He possesses her, it is true, I know that, as I knowmuch more, and I have become accustomed to the thought that hewill drive me mad, or, perhaps, murder me.  Is his friendshiptoward me unimpaired?  Does he not view my attachment to Charlotteas an infringement upon his rights, and consider my attention toher as a silent rebuke to himself?  I know, and indeed feel, thathe dislikes me, that he wishes for my absence, that my presenceis hateful to him.""

ííííHe would often pause when on his way to visit Charlotte, standstill, as though in doubt, and seem desirous of returning, butwould nevertheless proceed; and, engaged in such thoughts andsoliloquies as we have described, he finally reached the hunting-lodge,with a sort of involuntary consent.

ííííUpon one occasion he entered the house; and, inquiring forCharlotte, he observed that the inmates were in a state ofunusual confusion.  The eldest boy informed him that a dreadfulmisfortune had occurred at Walheim, -- that a peasant had beenmurdered!  But this made little impression upon him.  Enteringthe apartment, he found Charlotte engaged reasoning with her father,who, in spite of his infirmity, insisted on going to the scene ofthe crime, in order to institute an inquiry.  The criminal wasunknown; the victim had been found dead at his own door thatmorning.  Suspicions were excited: the murdered man had been inthe service of a widow, and the person who had previously filledthe situation had been dismissed from her employment.

ííííAs soon as Werther heard this, he exclaimed with great excitement,""Is it possible!  I must go to the spot -- I cannot delay a moment!""He hastened to Walheim.  Every incident returned vividly to hisremembrance; and he entertained not the slightest doubt that thatman was the murderer to whom he had so often spoken, and for whomhe entertained so much regard.  His way took him past the well-knownlime trees, to the house where the body had been carried; and hisfeelings were greatly excited at the sight of the fondly recollectedspot.  That threshold where the neighbours' children had so oftenplayed together was stained with blood; love and attachment, thenoblest feelings of human nature, had been converted into violenceand murder.  The huge trees stood there leafless and covered withhoarfrost; the beautiful hedgerows which surrounded the oldchurchyard wall were withered; and the gravestones, half coveredwith snow, were visible through the openings.

ííííAs he approached the inn, in front of which the whole village wasassembled, screams were suddenly heard.  A troop of armed peasantswas seen approaching, and every one exclaimed that the criminalhad been apprehended.  Werther looked, and was not long in doubt.The prisoner was no other than the servant, who had been formerlyso attached to the widow, and whom he had met prowling about, withthat suppressed anger and ill-concealed despair, which we havebefore described.

íííí""What have you done, unfortunate man?"" inquired Werther, as headvanced toward the prisoner.  The latter turned his eyes upon himin silence, and then replied with perfect composure; ""No one willnow marry her, and she will marry no one.""  The prisoner was takeninto the inn, and Werther left the place.  The mind of Werther wasfearfully excited by this shocking occurrence.  He ceased, however,to be oppressed by his usual feeling of melancholy, moroseness,and indifference to everything that passed around him.  He entertaineda strong degree of pity for the prisoner, and was seized with anindescribable anxiety to save him from his impending fate.  Heconsidered him so unfortunate, he deemed his crime so excusable,and thought his own condition so nearly similar, that he feltconvinced he could make every one else view the matter in the lightin which he saw it himself.  He now became anxious to undertakehis defence, and commenced composing an eloquent speech for theoccasion; and, on his way to the hunting-lodge, he could not refrainfrom speaking aloud the statement which he resolved to make to thejudge.

ííííUpon his arrival, he found Albert had been before him: and he wasa little perplexed by this meeting; but he soon recovered himself,and expressed his opinion with much warmth to the judge.  Thelatter shook, his head doubtingly; and although Werther urged hiscase with the utmost zeal, feeling, and determination in defenceof his client, yet, as we may easily suppose, the judge was notmuch influenced by his appeal.  On the contrary, he interruptedhim in his address, reasoned with him seriously, and even administereda rebuke to him for becoming the advocate of a murderer.  Hedemonstrated, that, according to this precedent, every law mightbe violated, and the public security utterly destroyed.  He added,moreover, that in such a case he could himself do nothing,without incurring the greatest responsibility; that everythingmust follow in the usual course, and pursue the ordinary channel.

ííííWerther, however, did not abandon his enterprise, and even besoughtthe judge to connive at the flight of the prisoner.  But thisproposal was peremptorily rejected.  Albert, who had taken somepart in the discussion, coincided in opinion with the judge.  Atthis Werther became enraged, and took his leave in great anger,after the judge had more than once assured him that the prisonercould not be saved.

ííííThe excess of his grief at this assurance may be inferred from anote we have found amongst his papers, and which was doubtlesswritten upon this very occasion.

íííí""You cannot be saved, unfortunate man!  I see clearly that wecannot be saved!""

ííííWerther was highly incensed at the observations which Albert hadmade to the judge in this matter of the prisoner.  He thought hecould detect therein a little bitterness toward himself personally;and although, upon reflection, it could not escape his soundjudgment that their view of the matter was correct, he felt thegreatest possible reluctance to make such an admission.

ííííA memorandum of Werther's upon this point, expressive of his generalfeelings toward Albert, has been found amongst his papers.

íííí""What is the use of my continually repeating that he is a good andestimable man?  He is an inward torment to me, and I am incapableof being just toward him.""

ííííOne fine evening in winter, when the weather seemed inclined tothaw, Charlotte and Albert were returning home together.  Theformer looked from time to time about her, as if she missed Werther'scompany.  Albert began to speak of him, and censured him for hisprejudices.  He alluded to his unfortunate attachment, and wishedit were possible to discontinue his acquaintance. ""I desire it onour own account,"" he added; ""and I request you will compel him toalter his deportment toward you, and to visit you less frequently.The world is censorious, and I know that here and there we arespoken of.""  Charlotte made no reply, and Albert seemed to feelher silence.  At least, from that time he never again spoke ofWerther; and, when she introduced the subject, he allowed theconversation to die away, or else he directed the discourse intoanother channel.

ííííThe vain attempt Werther had made to save the unhappy murderer wasthe last feeble glimmering of a flame about to be extinguished.He sank almost immediately afterward into a state of gloom andinactivity, until he was at length brought to perfect distractionby learning that he was to be summoned as a witness against theprisoner, who asserted his complete innocence.

ííííHis mind now became oppressed by the recollection of every misfortuneof his past life.  The mortification he had suffered at theambassador's, and his subsequent troubles, were revived in hismemory.  He became utterly inactive.  Destitute of energy, he wascut off from every pursuit and occupation which compose the businessof common life; and he became a victim to his own susceptibility,and to his restless passion for the most amiable and beloved ofwomen, whose peace he destroyed.  In this unvarying monotony ofexistence his days were consumed; and his powers became exhaustedwithout aim or design, until they brought him to a sorrowful end.

ííííA few letters which he left behind, and which we here subjoin,afford the best proofs of his anxiety of mind and of the depthof his passion, as well as of his doubts and struggles, and ofhis weariness of life.

ííííDECEMBER 12.

ííííDear Wilhelm, I am reduced to the condition of those unfortunatewretches who believe they are pursued by an evil spirit.  SometimesI am oppressed, not by apprehension or fear, but by an inexpressibleinternal sensation, which weighs upon my heart, and impedes mybreath!  Then I wander forth at night, even in this tempestuousseason, and feel pleasure in surveying the dreadful scenes aroundme.

ííííYesterday evening I went forth.  A rapid thaw had suddenly setin: I had been informed that the river had risen, that the brookshad all overflowed their banks, and that the whole vale of Walheimwas under water!  Upon the stroke of twelve I hastened forth.  Ibeheld a fearful sight.  The foaming torrents rolled from themountains in the moonlight, -- fields and meadows, trees andhedges, were confounded together; and the entire valley wasconverted into a deep lake, which was agitated by the roaringwind!  And when the moon shone forth, and tinged the black cloudswith silver, and the impetuous torrent at my feet foamed and resoundedwith awful and grand impetuosity, I was overcome by a mingled sensationof apprehension and delight.  With extended arms I looked down intothe yawning abyss, and cried, ""Plunge!'"" For a moment my sensesforsook me, in the intense delight of ending my sorrows and mysufferings by a plunge into that gulf!  And then I felt as if Iwere rooted to the earth, and incapable of seeking an end to mywoes!  But my hour is not yet come: I feel it is not.  O Wilhelm,how willingly could I abandon my existence to ride the whirlwind,or to embrace the torrent! and then might not rapture perchance bethe portion of this liberated soul?

ííííI turned my sorrowful eyes toward a favourite spot, where I wasaccustomed to sit with Charlotte beneath a willow after a fatiguingwalk.  Alas! it was covered with water, and with difficulty I foundeven the meadow.  And the fields around the hunting-lodge, thoughtI.  Has our dear bower been destroyed by this unpitying storm?And a beam of past happiness streamed upon me, as the mind of acaptive is illumined by dreams of flocks and herds and bygone joysof home!  But I am free from blame.  I have courage to die!  PerhapsI have, -- but I still sit here, like a wretched pauper, who collectsfagots, and begs her bread from door to door, that she may prolongfor a few days a miserable existence which she is unwilling to resign.

ííííDECEMBER 15.

ííííWhat is the matter with me, dear Wilhelm?  I am afraid of myself!Is not my love for her of the purest, most holy, and most brotherlynature?  Has my soul ever been sullied by a single sensual desire?but I will make no protestations.  And now, ye nightly visions,how truly have those mortals understood you, who ascribe yourvarious contradictory effects to some invincible power!  This nightI tremble at the avowal -- I held her in my arms, locked in a closeembrace: I pressed her to my bosom, and covered with countlesskisses those dear lips which murmured in reply soft protestationsof love.  My sight became confused by the delicious intoxicationof her eyes.  Heavens! is it sinful to revel again in such happiness,to recall once more those rapturous moments with intense delight?Charlotte!  Charlotte!  I am lost!  My senses are bewildered, myrecollection is confused, mine eyes are bathed in tears -- I amill; and yet I am well -- I wish for nothing -- I have no desires-- it were better I were gone.

ííííUnder the circumstances narrated above, a determination to quitthis world had now taken fixed possession of Werther's soul.  SinceCharlotte's return, this thought had been the final object of allhis hopes and wishes; but he had resolved that such a step shouldnot be taken with precipitation, but with calmness and tranquillity,and with the most perfect deliberation.

ííííHis troubles and internal struggles may be understood from thefollowing fragment, which was found, without any date, amongsthis papers, and appears to have formed the beginning of a letterto Wilhelm.

íííí""Her presence, her fate, her sympathy for me, have power still toextract tears from my withered brain.

íííí""One lifts up the curtain, and passes to the other side, -- thatis all!  And why all these doubts and delays?  Because we know notwhat is behind -- because there is no returning -- and because ourmind infers that all is darkness and confusion, where we havenothing but uncertainty.""

ííííHis appearance at length became quite altered by the effect ofhis melancholy thoughts; and his resolution was now finally andirrevocably taken, of which the following ambiguous letter, whichhe addressed to his friend, may appear to afford some proof.

ííííDECEMBER 2O.

ííííI am grateful to your love, Wilhelm, for having repeated youradvice so seasonably.  Yes, you are right: it is undoubtedlybetter that I should depart.  But I do not entirely approve yourscheme of returning at once to your neighbourhood; at least, Ishould Iike to make a little excursion on the way, particularlyas we may now expect a continued frost, and consequently goodroads.  I am much pleased with your intention of coming to fetchme; only delay your journey for a fortnight, and wait for anotherletter from me.  One should gather nothing before it is ripe, anda fortnight sooner or later makes a great difference.  Entreat mymother to pray for her son, and tell her I beg her pardon for allthe unhappiness I have occasioned her.  It has ever been my fateto give pain to those whose happiness I should have promoted.Adieu, my dearest friend.  May every blessing of Heaven attendyou!  Farewell.

ííííWe find it difficult to express the emotions with which Charlotte'ssoul was agitated during the whole of this time, whether in relationto her husband or to her unfortunate friend; although we are enabled,by our knowledge of her character, to understand their nature.

ííííIt is certain that she had formed a determination, by every meansin her power to keep Werther at a distance; and, if she hesitatedin her decision, it was from a sincere feeling of friendly pity,knowing how much it would cost him, indeed, that he would find italmost impossible to comply with her wishes.  But various causesnow urged her to be firm.  Her hushand preserved a strict silenceabout the whole matter; and she never made it a subject ofconversation, feeling bound to prove to him by her conduct thather sentiments agreed with his.

ííííThe same day, which was the Sunday before Christmas, after Wertherhad written the last-mentioned letter to his friend, he came inthe evening to Charlotte's house, and found her alone.  She wasbusy preparing some little gifts for her brothers and sisters,which were to be distributed to them on Christmas Day.  He begantalking of the delight of the children, and of that age when thesudden appearance of the Christmas-tree, decorated with fruit andsweetmeats, and lighted up with wax candles, causes such transportsof joy.  ""You shall have a gift too, if you behave well,"" saidCharlotte, hiding her embarrassment under sweet smile.  ""And whatdo you call behaving well?  What should I do, what can I do, mydear Charlotte?"" said he.  ""Thursday night,"" she answered, ""isChristmas Eve.  The children are all to be here, and my father too:there is a present for each; do you come likewise, but do not comebefore that time.""  Werther started.  ""I desire you will not: it mustbe so,"" she continued.  ""I ask it of you as a favour, for my ownpeace and tranquillity.  We cannot go on in this manner any longer.""He turned away his face walked hastily up and down the room, mutteringindistinctly, ""We cannot go on in this manner any longer!""  Charlotte,seeing the violent agitation into which these words had thrown him,endeavoured to divert his thoughts by different questions, but in vain.""No, Charlotte!"" he exclaimed; ""I will never see you any more!""""And why so?"" she answered. ""We may -- we must see each otheragain; only let it be with more discretion.  Oh! why were you bornwith that excessive, that ungovernable passion for everything thatis dear to you?""  Then, taking his hand, she said, ""I entreat ofyou to be more calm: your talents, your understanding, your genius,will furnish you with a thousand resources.  Be a man, and conqueran unhappy attachment toward a creature who can do nothing but pityyou.""  He bit his lips, and looked at her with a gloomy countenance.She continued to hold his hand.  ""Grant me but a moment's patience,Werther,"" she said.  ""Do you not see that you are deceiving yourself,that you are seeking your own destruction?  Why must you love me,me only, who belong to another?  I fear, I much fear, that it isonly the impossibility of possessing me which makes your desire forme so strong.""  He drew back his hand, whilst he surveyed her witha wild and angry look.  ""'Tis well!"" he exclaimed, ""'tis very well!Did not Albert furnish you with this reflection?  It is profound,a very profound remark.""  ""A reflection that any one might easilymake,"" she answered; ""and is there not a woman in the whole worldwho is at liberty, and has the power to make you happy?  Conqueryourself: look for such a being, and believe me when I say that youwill certainly find her.  I have long felt for you, and for us all:you have confined yourself too long within the limits of too narrowa circle.  Conquer yourself; make an effort: a short journey willbe of service to you.  Seek and find an object worthy of your love;then return hither, and let us enjoy together all the happiness ofthe most perfect friendship.""

íííí""This speech,"" replied Werther with a cold smile, ""this speechshould be printed, for the benefit of all teachers.  My dearCharlotte, allow me but a short time longer, and all will be well.""""But however, Werther,"" she added, ""do not come again beforeChristmas.""  He was about to make some answer, when Albert came in.They saluted each other coldly, and with mutual embarrassment pacedup and down the room.  Werther made some common remarks; Albertdid the same, and their conversation soon dropped.  Albert askedhis wife about some household matters; and, finding that hiscommissions were not executed, he used some expressions which, toWerther's ear, savoured of extreme harshness.  He wished to go,but had not power to move; and in this situation he remained tilleight o'clock, his uneasiness and discontent continually increasing.At length the cloth was laid for supper, and he took up his hatand stick.  Albert invited him to remain; but Werther, fancyingthat he was merely paying a formal compliment, thanked him coldly,amd left the house.

ííííWerther returned home, took the candle from his servant, and retiredto his room alone.  He talked for some time with great earnestnessto himself, wept aloud, walked in a state of great excitementthrough his chamber; till at length, without undressing, he threwhimself on the bed, where he was found by his servant at eleveno'clock, when the latter ventured to enter the room, and take offhis boots.  Werther did not prevent him, but forbade him to come inthe morning till he should ring.

ííííOn Monday morning, the 21st of December, he wrote to Charlotte thefollowing letter, which was found, sealed, on his bureau after hisdeath, and was given to her.  I shall insert it in fragments; asit appears, from several circumstances, to have been written inthat manner.

íííí""It is all over, Charlotte: I am resolved to die!  I make thisdeclaration deliberately and coolly, without any romantic passion,on this morning of the day when I am to see you for the last time.At the moment you read these lines, O best of women, the cold gravewill hold the inanimate remains of that restless and unhappy beingwho, in the last moments of his existence, knew no pleasure sogreat as that of conversing with you!  I have passed a dreadfulnight or rather, let me say, a propitious one; for it has givenme resolution, it has fixed my purpose.  I am resolved to die.When I tore myself from you yesterday, my senses were in tumultand disorder; my heart was oppressed, hope and pleasure had fledfrom me for ever, and a petrifying cold had seized my wretchedbeing.  I could scarcely reach my room.  I threw myself on my knees;and Heaven, for the last time, granted me the consolation ofshedding tears.  A thousand ideas, a thousand schemes, arose withinmy soul; till at length one last, fixed, final thought tookpossession of my heart.  It was to die.  I lay down to rest; andin the morning, in the quiet hour of awakening, the same determinationwas upon me.  To die!  It is not despair: it is conviction that Ihave filled up the measure of my sufferings, that I have reachedmy appointed term, and must sacrifice myself for thee.  Yes,Charlotte, why should I not avow it?  One of us three must die:it shall be Werther.  O beloved Charlotte! this heart, excited byrage and fury, has often conceived the horrid idea of murderingyour husband -- you -- myself!  The lot is cast at length.  Andin the bright, quiet evenings of summer, when you sometimes wandertoward the mountains, let your thoughts then turn to me: recollecthow often you have watched me coming to meet you from the valley;then bend your eyes upon the churchyard which contains my grave,and, by the light of the setting sun, mark how the evening breezewaves the tall grass which grows above my tomb.  I was calm whenI began this letter, but the recollection of these scenes makesme weep like a child.""

ííííAbout ten in the morning, Werther called his servant, and, whilsthe was dressing, told him that in a few days he intended to setout upon a journey, and bade him therefore lay his clothes inorder, and prepare them for packing up, call in all his accounts,fetch home the books he had lent, and give two months' pay to thepoor dependants who were accustomed to receive from him a weeklyallowance.

ííííHe breakfasted in his room, and then mounted his horse, and wentto visit the steward, who, however, was not at home.  He walkedpensively in the garden, and seemed anxious to renew all the ideasthat were most painful to him.

ííííThe children did not suffer him to remain alone long.  They followedhim, skipping and dancing before him, and told him, that afterto-morrow and tomorrow and one day more, they were to receive theirChristmas gift from Charlotte; and they then recounted all thewonders of which they had formed ideas in their child imaginations.""Tomorrow and tomorrow,"" said he, ""and one day more!""  And hekissed them tenderly.  He was going; but the younger boy stoppedhim, to whisper something in his ear.  He told him that his elderbrothers had written splendid New-Year's wishes so large! one forpapa, and another for Albert and Charlotte, and one for Werther;and they were to be presented early in the morning, on New Year'sDay.  This quite overcame him.  He made each of the children apresent, mounted his horse, left his compliments for papa andmamma, and, with tears in his eyes, rode away from the place.

ííííHe returned home about five o'clock, ordered his servant to keepup his fire, desired him to pack his books and linen at the bottomof the trunk, and to place his coats at the top.  He then appearsto have made the following addition to the letter addressed toCharlotte:

íííí""You do not expect me.  You think I will obey you, and not visityou again till Christmas Eve.  O Charlotte, today or never!  OnChristmas Eve you will hold this paper in your hand; you willtremble, and moisten it with your tears.  I will -- I must!  Oh, howhappy I feel to be determined!""

ííííIn the meantime, Charlotte was in a pitiable state of mind.  Afterher last conversation with Werther, she found how painful to herselfit would be to decline his visits, and knew how severely he wouldsuffer from their separation.

ííííShe had, in conversation with Albert, mentioned casually that Wertherwould not return before Christmas Eve; and soon afterward Albertwent on horseback to see a person in the neighbourhood, with whomhe had to transact some business which would detain him all night.

ííííCharlotte was sitting alone.  None of her family were near, andshe gave herself up to the reflections that silently took possessionof her mind.  She was for ever united to a husband whose love andfidelity she had proved, to whom she was heartily devoted, and whoseemed to be a special gift from Heaven to ensure her happiness.On the other hand, Werther had become dear to her.  There was acordial unanimity of sentiment between them from the very firsthour of their acquaintance, and their long association and repeatedinterviews had made an indelible impression upon her heart.  Shehad been accustomed to communicate to him every thought and feelingwhich interested her, and his absence threatened to open a voidin her existence which it might be impossible to fill.  How heartilyshe wished that she might change him into her brother, -- that shecould induce him to marry one of her own friends, or could reestablishhis intimacy with Albert.

ííííShe passed all her intimate friends in review before her mind, butfound something objectionable in each, and could decide upon noneto whom she would consent to give him.

ííííAmid all these considerations she felt deeply but indistinctlythat her own real but unexpressed wish was to retain him for herself,and her pure and amiable heart felt from this thought a sense ofoppression which seemed to forbid a prospect of happiness.  Shewas wretched: a dark cloud obscured her mental vision.

ííííIt was now half-past six o'clock, and she heard Werther's step onthe stairs.  She at once recognised his voice, as he inquired ifshe were at home.  Her heart beat audibly -- we could almost sayfor the first time -- at his arrival.  It was too late to denyherself; and, as he entered, she exclaimed, with a sort of illconcealed confusion, ""You have not kept your word!""  ""I promisednothing,"" he answered.  ""But you should have complied, at leastfor my sake,"" she continued. "" I implore you, for both our sakes.""

ííííShe scarcely knew what she said or did; and sent for some friends,who, by their presence, might prevent her being left alone withWerther.  He put down some books he had brought with him, thenmade inquiries about some others, until she began to hope that herfriends might arrive shortly, entertaining at the same time adesire that they might stay away.

ííííAt one moment she felt anxious that the servant should remain inthe adjoining room, then she changed her mind.  Werther, meanwhile,walked impatiently up and down.  She went to the piano, anddetermined not to retire.  She then collected her thoughts, andsat down quietly at Werther's side, who had taken his usual placeon the sofa.

íííí""Have you brought nothing to read?"" she inquired.  He had nothing.""There in my drawer,"" she continued, ""you will find your owntranslation of some of the songs of Ossian.  I have not yet readthem, as I have still hoped to hear you recite them; but, for sometime past, I have not been able to accomplish such a wish.""  Hesmiled, and went for the manuscript, which he took with a shudder.He sat down; and, with eyes full of tears, he began to read.

íííí""Star of descending night! fair is thy light in the west! thouliftest thy unshorn head from thy cloud; thy steps are stately onthy hill.  What dost thou behold in the plain?  The stormy windsare laid.  The murmur of the torrent comes from afar.  Roaringwaves climb the distant rock.  The flies of evening are on theirfeeble wings: the hum of their course is on the field.  What dostthou behold, fair light?  But thou dost smile and depart.  Thewaves come with joy around thee: they bathe thy lovely hair.Farewell, thou silent beam!  Let the light of Ossian's soul arise!

íííí""And it does arise in its strength!  I behold my departed friends.Their gathering is on Lora, as in the days of other years.  Fingalcomes like a watery column of mist! his heroes are around: andsee the bards of song, gray-haired Ullin! stately Ryno! Alpin withthe tuneful voice: the soft complaint of Minona!  How are ye changed,my friends, since the days of Selma's feast! when we contended,like gales of spring as they fly along the hill, and bend by turnsthe feebly whistling grass.

íííí""Minona came forth in her beauty, with downcast look and tearfuleye.  Her hair was flying slowly with the blast that rushedunfrequent from the hill.  The souls of the heroes were sad whenshe raised the tuneful voice.  Oft had they seen the grave ofSalgar, the dark dwelling of white-bosomed Colma.  Colma left aloneon the hill with all her voice of song!  Salgar promised to come!but the night descended around.  Hear the voice of Colma, when shesat alone on the hill!

íííí""Colma.  It is night: I am alone, forlorn on the hill of storms.The wind is heard on the mountain.  The torrent is howling downthe rock.  No hut receives me from the rain: forlorn on the hillof winds!

íííí""Rise moon! from behind thy clouds.  Stars of the night, arise!Lead me, some light, to the place where my love rests from thechase alone!  His bow near him unstrung, his dogs panting aroundhim!  But here I must sit alone by the rock of the mossy stream.The stream and the wind roar aloud.  I hear not the voice of mylove!  Why delays my Salgar; why the chief of the hill his promise?Here is the rock and here the tree! here is the roaring stream!Thou didst promise with night to be here.  Ah! whither is my Salgargone?  With thee I would fly from my father, with thee from mybrother of pride.  Our race have long been foes: we are not foes,O Salgar!

íííí""Cease a little while, O wind! stream, be thou silent awhile! letmy voice be heard around! let my wanderer hear me!  Salgar! it isColma who calls.  Here is the tree and the rock.  Salgar, my love,I am here!  Why delayest thou thy coming?  Lo! the calm moon comesforth.  The flood is bright in the vale.  The rocks are gray onthe steep.  I see him not on the brow.  His dogs come not beforehim with tidings of his near approach.  Here I must sit alone!

íííí""Who lie on the heath beside me?  Are they my love and my brother?Speak to me, O my friends!  To Colma they give no reply.  Speakto me: I am alone!  My soul is tormented with fears.  Ah, they aredead!  Their swords are red from the fight.  O my brother! mybrother! why hast thou slain my Salgar!  Why, O Salgar, hast thouslain my brother!  Dear were ye both to me! what shall I say inyour praise?  Thou wert fair on the hill among thousands! he wasterrible in fight!  Speak to me! hear my voice! hear me, sons ofmy love!  They are silent! silent for ever!  Cold, cold, are theirbreasts of clay!  Oh, from the rock on the hill, from the top ofthe windy steep, speak, ye ghosts of the dead!  Speak, I will notbe afraid!  Whither are ye gone to rest?  In what cave of the hillshall I find the departed?  No feeble voice is on the gale: noanswer half drowned in the storm!

íííí""I sit in my grief: I wait for morning in my tears!  Rear the tomb,ye friends of the dead.  Close it not till Colma come.  My lifeflies away like a dream.  Why should I stay behind?  Here shall Irest with my friends, by the stream of the sounding rock.  Whennight comes on the hill when the loud winds arise my ghost shallstand in the blast, and mourn the death of my friends.  The huntershall hear from his booth; he shall fear, but love my voice!  Forsweet shall my voice be for my friends: pleasant were her friendsto Colma.

íííí""Such was thy song, Minona, softly blushing daughter of Torman.Our tears descended for Colma, and our souls were sad!  Ullin camewith his harp; he gave the song of Alpin.  The voice of Alpin waspleasant, the soul of Ryno was a beam of fire!  But they had restedin the narrow house: their voice had ceased in Selma!  Ullin hadreturned one day from the chase before the heroes fell.  He heardtheir strife on the hill: their song was soft, but sad!  Theymourned the fall of Morar, first of mortal men!  His soul was likethe soul of Fingal: his sword like the sword of Oscar.  But hefell, and his father mourned: his sister's eyes were full of tears.Minona's eyes were full of tears, the sister of car-borne Morar.She retired from the song of Ullin, like the moon in the west,when she foresees the shower, and hides her fair head in a cloud.I touched the harp with Ullin: the song of morning rose!

íííí""Ryno.  The wind and the rain are past, calm is the noon of day.The clouds are divided in heaven.  Over the green hills flies theinconstant sun.  Red through the stony vale comes down the streamof the hill.  Sweet are thy murmurs, O stream! but more sweet isthe voice I hear.  It is the voice of Alpin, the son of song,mourning for the dead!  Bent is his head of age: red his tearfuleye.  Alpin, thou son of song, why alone on the silent hill? whycomplainest thou, as a blast in the wood as a wave on the lonelyshore?

íííí""Alpin.  My tears, O Ryno! are for the dead my voice for thosethat have passed away.  Tall thou art on the hill; fair among thesons of the vale.  But thou shalt fall like Morar: the mournershall sit on thy tomb.  The hills shall know thee no more: thy bowshall lie in thy hall unstrung!

íííí""Thou wert swift, O Morar! as a roe on the desert: terrible as ameteor of fire.  Thy wrath was as the storm.  Thy sword in battleas lightning in the field.  Thy voice was as a stream after rain,like thunder on distant hills.  Many fell by thy arm: they wereconsumed in the flames of thy wrath.  But when thou didst returnfrom war, how peaceful was thy brow.  Thy face was like the sunafter rain: like the moon in the silence of night: calm as thebreast of the lake when the loud wind is laid.

íííí""Narrow is thy dwelling now! dark the place of thine abode!  Withthree steps I compass thy grave, O thou who wast so great before!Four stones, with their heads of moss, are the only memorial ofthee.  A tree with scarce a leaf, long grass which whistles in thewind, mark to the hunter's eye the grave of the mighty Morar.Morar! thou art low indeed.  Thou hast no mother to mourn thee,no maid with her tears of love.  Dead is she that brought theeforth.  Fallen is the daughter of Morglan.

íííí""Who on his staff is this?  Who is this whose head is white withage, whose eyes are red with tears, who quakes at every step?  Itis thy father, O Morar! the father of no son but thee.  He heardof thy fame in war, he heard of foes dispersed.  He heard of Morar'srenown, why did he not hear of his wound?  Weep, thou father ofMorar!  Weep, but thy son heareth thee not.  Deep is the sleep ofthe dead, low their pillow of dust.  No more shall he hear thyvoice, no more awake at thy call.  When shall it be morn in thegrave, to bid the slumberer awake?  Farewell, thou bravest of men!thou conqueror in the field!  but the field shall see thee no more,nor the dark wood be lightened with the splendour of thy steel.Thou has left no son.  The song shall preserve thy name.  Futuretimes shall hear of thee they shall hear of the fallen Morar!

íííí""The grief of all arose, but most the bursting sigh of Armin.  Heremembers the death of his son, who fell in the days of his youth.Carmor was near the hero, the chief of the echoing Galmal.  Whyburst the sigh of Armin? he said.  Is there a cause to mourn?  Thesong comes with its music to melt and please the soul.  It is likesoft mist that, rising from a lake, pours on the silent vale;the green flowers are filled with dew, but the sun returns in hisstrength, and the mist is gone.  Why art thou sad, O Armin, chiefof sea-surrounded Gorma?

íííí""Sad I am! nor small is my cause of woe!  Carmor, thou hast lostno son; thou hast lost no daughter of beauty.  Colgar the valiantlives, and Annira, fairest maid.  The boughs of thy house ascend,O Carmor! but Armin is the last of his race.  Dark is thy bed, ODaura! deep thy sleep in the tomb!  When shalt thou wake with thysongs? with all thy voice of music?

íííí""Arise, winds of autumn, arise: blow along the heath.  Streams ofthe mountains, roar; roar, tempests in the groves of my oaks!  Walkthrough broken clouds, O moon! show thy pale face at intervals;bring to my mind the night when all my children fell, when Arindalthe mighty fell -- when Daura the lovely failed.  Daura, my daughter,thou wert fair, fair as the moon on Fura, white as the driven snow,sweet as the breathing gale.  Arindal, thy bow was strong, thy spearwas swift on the field, thy look was like mist on the wave, thyshield a red cloud in a storm!  Armar, renowned in war, came andsought Daura's love.  He was not long refused: fair was the hopeof their friends.

íííí""Erath, son of Odgal, repined: his brother had been slain by Armar.He came disguised like a son of the sea: fair was his cliff on thewave, white his locks of age, calm his serious brow.  Fairest ofwomen, he said, lovely daughter of Armin! a rock not distant inthe sea bears a tree on its side; red shines the fruit afar.  ThereArmar waits for Daura.  I come to carry his love! she went shecalled on Armar.  Nought answered, but the son of the rock.  Armar,my love, my love! why tormentest thou me with fear?  Hear, son ofArnart, hear! it is Daura who calleth thee.  Erath, the traitor,fled laughing to the land.  She lifted up her voice-- she calledfor her brother and her father.  Arindal!  Armin! none to relieveyou, Daura.

íííí""Her voice came over the sea.  Arindal, my son, descended from thehill, rough in the spoils of the chase.  His arrows rattled by hisside; his bow was in his hand, five dark-gray dogs attended hissteps.  He saw fierce Erath on the shore; he seized and bound himto an oak.  Thick wind the thongs of the hide around his limbs;he loads the winds with his groans.  Arindal ascends the deep inhis boat to bring Daura to land.  Armar came in his wrath, andlet fly the gray-feathered shaft.  It sung, it sunk in thy heart,O Arindal, my son! for Erath the traitor thou diest.  The oar isstopped at once: he panted on the rock, and expired.  What is thygrief, O Daura, when round thy feet is poured thy brother's blood.The boat is broken in twain.  Armar plunges into the sea to rescuehis Daura, or die.  Sudden a blast from a hill came over the waves;he sank, and he rose no more.

íííí""Alone, on the sea-beat rock, my daughter was heard to complain;frequent and loud were her cries.  What could her father do?  Allnight I stood on the shore: I saw her by the faint beam of the moon.All night I heard her cries.  Loud was the wind; the rain beat hardon the hill.  Before morning appeared, her voice was weak; it diedaway like the evening breeze among the grass of the rocks.  Spentwith grief, she expired, and left thee, Armin, alone.  Gone is mystrength in war, fallen my pride among women.  When the stormsaloft arise, when the north lifts the wave on high, I sit by thesounding shore, and look on the fatal rock.

íííí""Often by the setting moon I see the ghosts of my children; halfviewless they walk in mournful conference together.""

ííííA torrent of tears which streamed from Charlotte's eyes and gaverelief to her bursting heart, stopped Werther's recitation.  Hethrew down the book, seized her hand, and wept bitterly.  Charlotteleaned upon her hand, and buried her face in her handkerchief:the agitation of both was excessive.  They felt that their ownfate was pictured in the misfortunes of Ossian's heroes, theyfelt this together, and their tears redoubled.  Werther supportedhis forehead on Charlotte's arm: she trembled, she wished to begone; but sorrow and sympathy lay like a leaden weight upon hersoul.  She recovered herself shortly, and begged Werther, withbroken sobs, to leave her, implored him with the utmost earnestnessto comply with her request.  He trembled; his heart was ready toburst: then, taking up the book again, he recommenced reading, ina voice broken by sobs.

íííí""Why dost thou waken me, O spring?  Thy voice woos me, exclaiming,I refresh thee with heavenly dews; but the time of my decay isapproaching, the storm is nigh that shall whither my leaves.Tomorrow the traveller shall come, he shall come, who beheld mein beauty: his eye shall seek me in the field around, but he shallnot find me.""

ííííThe whole force of these words fell upon the unfortunate Werther.Full of despair, he threw himself at Charlotte's feet, seized herhands, and pressed them to his eyes and to his forehead.  Anapprehension of his fatal project now struck her for the firsttime.  Her senses were bewildered: she held his hands, pressedthem to her bosom; and, leaning toward him with emotions of thetenderest pity, her warm cheek touched his.  They lost sight ofeverything.  The world disappeared from their eyes.  He claspedher in his arms, strained her to his bosom, and covered her tremblinglips with passionate kisses.  ""Werther!"" she cried with a faintvoice, turning herself away;  ""Werther!"" and, with a feeble hand,she pushed him from her.  At length, with the firm voice of virtue,she exclaimed, ""Werther!"" He resisted not, but, tearing himselffrom her arms, fell on his knees before her.  Charlotte rose, and,with disordered grief, in mingled tones of love and resentment,she exclaimed, ""It is the last time, Werther!  You shall never seeme any more!""  Then, casting one last, tender look upon herunfortunate lover, she rushed into the adjoining room, and lockedthe door.  Werther held out his arms, but did not dare to detainher.  He continued on the ground, with his head resting on thesofa, for half an hour, till he heard a noise which brought himto his senses.  The servant entered.  He then walked up and downthe room; and, when he was again left alone, he went to Charlotte'sdoor, and, in a low voice, said, ""Charlotte, Charlotte! but oneword more, one last adieu!""  She returned no answer.  He stopped,and listened and entreated; but all was silent.  At length he torehimself from the place, crying, ""Adieu, Charlotte, adieu for ever!""

ííííWerther ran to the gate of the town.  The guards, who knew him,let him pass in silence.  The night was dark and stormy, -- itrained and snowed.  He reached his own door about eleven.  Hisservant, although seeing him enter the house without his hat, didnot venture to say anything; and; as he undressed his master, hefound that his clothes were wet.  His hat was afterward found onthe point of a rock overhanging the valley; and it is inconceivablehow he could have climbed to the summit on such a dark, tempestuousnight without losing his life.

ííííHe retired to bed, and slept to a late hour.  The next morning hisservant, upon being called to bring his coffee, found him writing.He was adding, to Charlotte, what we here annex.

íííí""For the last, last time I open these eyes.  Alas! they will beholdthe sun no more.  It is covered by a thick, impenetrable cloud.Yes, Nature! put on mourning: your child, your friend, your lover,draws near his end!  This thought, Charlotte, is without parallel;and yet it seems like a mysterious dream when I repeat -- this ismy last day!  The last!  Charlotte, no word can adequately expressthis thought.  The last!  To-day I stand erect in all my strengthto-morrow, cold and stark, I shall lie extended upon the ground.To die! what is death?  We do but dream in our discourse upon it.I have seen many human beings die; but, so straitened is our feeblenature, we have no clear conception of the beginning or the endof our existence.  At this moment I am my own -- or rather I amthine, thine, my adored! and the next we are parted, severed --perhaps for ever!  No, Charlotte, no!  How can I, how can you,be annihilated?  We exist.  What is annihilation?  A mere word,an unmeaning sound that fixes no impression on the mind.  Dead,Charlotte! laid in the cold earth, in the dark and narrow grave!I had a friend once who was everything to me in early youth.She died.  I followed her hearse; I stood by her grave when thecoffin was lowered; and when I heard the creaking of the cordsas they were loosened and drawn up, when the first shovelfulof earth was thrown in, and the coffin returned a hollow sound,which grew fainter and fainter till all was completely coveredover, I threw myself on the ground; my heart was smitten, grieved,shattered, rent -- but I neither knew what had happened, nor whatwas to happen to me.  Death! the grave!  I understand not the words.-- Forgive, oh, forgive me!  Yesterday -- ah, that day should havebeen the last of my life!  Thou angel! for the first time in myexistence, I felt rapture glow within my inmost soul.  She loves,she loves me!  Still burns upon my lips the sacred fire theyreceived from thine.  New torrents of delight overwhelm my soul.Forgive me, oh, forgive!

íííí""I knew that I was dear to you; I saw it in your first entrancinglook, knew it by the first pressure of your hand; but when I wasabsent from you, when I saw Albert at your side, my doubts andfears returned.

íííí""Do you remember the flowers you sent me, when, at that crowdedassembly, you could neither speak nor extend your hand to me?Half the night I was on my knees before those flowers, and Iregarded them as the pledges of your love; but those impressionsgrew fainter, and were at length effaced.

íííí""Everything passes away; but a whole eternity could not extinguishthe living flame which was yesterday kindled by your lips, andwhich now burns within me.  She loves me!  These arms have encircledher waist, these lips have trembled upon hers.  She is mine!  Yes,Charlotte, you are mine for ever!

íííí""And what do they mean by saying Albert is your husband?  He maybe so for this world; and in this world it is a sin to love you,to wish to tear you from his embrace.  Yes, it is a crime; and Isuffer the punishment, but I have enjoyed the full delight ofmy sin.  I have inhaled a balm that has revived my soul.  Fromthis hour you are mine; yes, Charlotte, you are mine!  I gobefore you.  I go to my Father and to your Father.  I will pourout my sorrows before him, and he will give me comfort till youarrive.  Then will I fly to meet you.  I will claim you, andremain your eternal embrace, in the presence of the Almighty.

íííí""I do not dream, I do not rave.  Drawing nearer to the grave myperceptions become clearer.  We shall exist; we shall see eachother again; we shall behold your mother; I shall behold her, andexpose to her my inmost heart.  Your mother -- your image!""

ííííAbout eleven o'clock Werther asked his servant if Albert hadreturned.  He answered, ""Yes;"" for he had seen him pass on horseback:upon which Werther sent him the following note, unsealed:

íííí""Be so good as to lend me your pistols for a journey.  Adieu.""

ííííCharlotte had slept little during the past night.  All herapprehensions were realised in a way that she could neitherforesee nor avoid.  Her blood was boiling in her veins, and athousand painful sensations rent her pure heart.  Was it theardour of Werther's passionate embraces that she felt within herbosom?  Was it anger at his daring?  Was it the sad comparisonof her present condition with former days of innocence, tranquillity,and self-confidence?  How could she approach her husband, andconfess a scene which she had no reason to conceal, and which sheyet felt, nevertheless, unwilling to avow?  They had preserved solong a silence toward each other and should she be the first tobreak it by so unexpected a discovery?  She feared that the merestatement of Werther's visit would trouble him, and his distresswould be heightened by her perfect candour.  She wished that hecould see her in her true light, and judge her without prejudice;but was she anxious that he should read her inmost soul?  On theother hand, could she deceive a being to whom all her thoughtshad ever been exposed as clearly as crystal, and from whom nosentiment had ever been concealed?  These reflections made heranxious and thoughtful.  Her mind still dwelt on Werther, who wasnow lost to her, but whom she could not bring herself to resign,and for whom she knew nothing was left but despair if she shouldbe lost to him for ever.

ííííA recollection of that mysterious estrangement which had latelysubsisted between herself and Albert, and which she could neverthoroughly understand, was now beyond measure painful to her.Even the prudent and the good have before now hesitated to explaintheir mutual differences, and have dwelt in silence upon theirimaginary grievances, until circumstances have become so entangled,that in that critical juncture, when a calm explanation wouldhave saved all parties, an understanding was impossible.  Andthus if domestic confidence had been earlier established betweenthem, if love and kind forbearance had mutually animated andexpanded their hearts, it might not, perhaps, even yet have beentoo late to save our friend.

ííííBut we must not forget one remarkable circumstance.  We mayobserve from the character of Werther's correspondence, thathe had never affected to conceal his anxious desire to quitthis world.  He had often discussed the subject with Albert;and, between the latter and Charlotte, it had not unfrequentlyformed a topic of conversation.  Albert was so opposed to the veryidea of such an action, that, with a degree of irritation unusualin him, he had more than once given Werther to understand that hedoubted the seriousness of his threats, and not only turned theminto ridicule, but caused Charlotte to share his feelings ofincredulity.  Her heart was thus tranquillised when she feltdisposed to view the melancholy subject in a serious point ofview, though she never communicated to her husband theapprehensions she sometimes experienced.

ííííAlbert, upon his return, was received by Charlotte withill-concealed embarrassment.  He was himself out of humour; hisbusiness was unfinished; and he had just discovered that theneighbouring official with whom he had to deal, was an obstinateand narrow-minded personage.  Many things had occurred to irritatehim.

ííííHe inquired whether anything had happened during his absence, andCharlotte hastily answered that Werther had been there on theevening previously.  He then inquired for his letters, and wasanswered that several packages had been left in his study.  Hethereon retired, leaving Charlotte alone.

ííííThe presence of the being she loved and honoured produced a newimpression on her heart.  The recollection of his generosity,kindness, and affection had calmed her agitation: a secret impulseprompted her to follow him; she took her work and went to hisstudy, as was often her custom.  He was busily employed openingand reading his letters.  It seemed as if the contents of somewere disagreeable.  She asked some questions: he gave short answers,and sat down to write.

ííííSeveral hours passed in this manner, and Charlotte's feelingsbecame more and more melancholy.  She felt the extreme difficultyof explaining to her husband, under any circumstances, the weightthat lay upon her heart; and her depression became every momentgreater, in proportion as she endeavoured to hide her grief, andto conceal her tears.

ííííThe arrival of Werther's servant occasioned her the greatestembarrassment.  He gave Albert a note, which the latter coldlyhanded to his wife, saying, at the same time, ""Give him the pistols.I wish him a pleasant journey,"" he added, turning to the servant.These words fell upon Charlotte like a thunderstroke: she rosefrom her seat half-fainting, and unconscious of what she did.  Shewalked mechanically toward the wall, took down the pistols with atrembling hand, slowly wiped the dust from them, and would havedelayed longer, had not Albert hastened her movements by an impatientlook.  She then delivered the fatal weapons to the servant, withoutbeing able to utter a word.  As soon as he had departed, she foldedup her work, and retired at once to her room, her heart overcomewith the most fearful forebodings.  She anticipated some dreadfulcalamity.  She was at one moment on the point of going to herhusband, throwing herself at his feet, and acquainting him withall that had happened on the previous evening, that she mightacknowledge her fault, and explain her apprehensions; then she sawthat such a step would be useless, as she would certainly be unableto induce Albert to visit Werther.  Dinner was served; and a kindfriend whom she had persuaded to remain assisted to sustain theconversation, which was carried on by a sort of compulsion, tillthe events of the morning were forgotten.

ííííWhen the servant brought the pistols to Werther, the latter receivedthem with transports of delight upon hearing that Charlotte hadgiven them to him with her own hand.  He ate some bread, dranksome wine, sent his servant to dinner, and then sat down to writeas follows:

íííí""They have been in your hands you wiped the dust from them.  Ikiss them a thousand times -- you have touched them.  Yes, Heavenfavours my design, and you, Charlotte, provide me with the fatalinstruments.  It was my desire to receive my death from your hands,and my wish is gratified.  I have made inquiries of my servant.You trembled when you gave him the pistols, but you bade me noadieu.  Wretched, wretched that I am -- not one farewell!  Howcould you shut your heart against me in that hour which makes youmine for ever?  Charlotte, ages cannot efface the impression -- Ifeel you cannot hate the man who so passionately loves you!""

ííííAfter dinner he called his servant, desired him to finish thepacking up, destroyed many papers, and then went out to pay sometrifling debts.  He soon returned home, then went out again,notwithstanding the rain, walked for some time in the count'sgarden, and afterward proceeded farther into the country.  Towardevening he came back once more, and resumed his writing.

íííí""Wilhelm, I have for the last time beheld the mountains, the forests,and the sky.  Farewell!  And you, my dearest mother, forgive me!Console her, Wilhelm.  God bless you!  I have settled all myaffairs!  Farewell!  We shall meet again, and be happier than ever.""

íííí""I have requited you badly, Albert; but you will forgive me.  Ihave disturbed the peace of your home.  I have sowed distrustbetween you.  Farewell!  I will end all this wretchedness.  Andoh, that my death may render you happy!  Albert, Albert! make thatangel happy, and the blessing of Heaven be upon you!""

ííííHe spent the rest of the evening in arranging his papers: he toreand burned a great many; others he sealed up, and directed toWilhelm.  They contained some detached thoughts and maxims, someof which I have perused.  At ten o'clock he ordered his fire tobe made up, and a bottle of wine to be brought to him.  He thendismissed his servant, whose room, as well as the apartments ofthe rest of the family, was situated in another part of the house.The servant lay down without undressing, that he might be thesooner ready for his journey in the morning, his master havinginformed him that the post-horses would be at the door before sixo'clock.

íííí""Past eleven o'clock!  All is silent around me, and my soul iscalm.  I thank thee, O God, that thou bestowest strength and courageupon me in these last moments!  I approach the window, my dearestof friends; and through the clouds, which are at this moment drivenrapidly along by the impetuous winds, I behold the stars whichillumine the eternal heavens.  No, you will not fall, celestialbodies: the hand of the Almighty supports both you and me!  I havelooked for the last time upon the constellation of the GreaterBear: it is my favourite star; for when I bade you farewell atnight, Charlotte, and turned my steps from your door, it alwaysshone upon me.  With what rapture have I at times beheld it!  Howoften have I implored it with uplifted hands to witness my felicity!and even still -- But what object is there, Charlotte, which failsto summon up your image before me?  Do you not surround me on allsides? and have I not, like a child, treasured up every triflewhich you have consecrated by your touch?

íííí""Your profile, which was so dear to me, I return to you; and Ipray you to preserve it.  Thousands of kisses have I imprintedupon it, and a thousand times has it gladdened my heart on departingfrom and returning to my home.

íííí""I have implored your father to protect my remains.  At the cornerof the churchyard, looking toward the fields, there are twolime-trees -- there I wish to lie.  Your father can, and doubtlesswill, do this much for his friend.  Implore it of him.  But perhapspious Christians will not choose that their bodies chould beburied near the corpse of a poor, unhappy wretch like me.  Thenlet me be laid in some remote valley, or near the highway, wherethe priest and Levite may bless themselves as they pass by mytomb, whilst the Samaritan will shed a tear for my fate.

íííí""See, Charlotte, I do not shudder to take the cold and fatal cup,from which I shall drink the draught of death.  Your hand presentsit to me, and I do not tremble.  All, all is now concluded: thewishes and the hopes of my existence are fulfilled.  With cold,unflinching hand I knock at the brazen portals of Death.  Oh, thatI had enjoyed the bliss of dying for you! how gladly would I havesacrificed myself for you; Charlotte!  And could I but restorepeace and joy to your bosom, with what resolution, with what joy,would I not meet my fate!  But it is the lot of only a chosen fewto shed their blood for their friends, and by their death toaugment, a thousand times, the happiness of those by whom they arebeloved.

ííííI wish, Charlotte, to be buried in the dress I wear at present:it has been rendered sacred by your touch.  I have begged thisfavour of your father.  My spirit soars above my sepulchre.  Ido not wish my pockets to be searched.  The knot of pink ribbonwhich you wore on your bosom the first time I saw you, surroundedby the children -- Oh, kiss them a thousand times for me, andtell them the fate of their unhappy friend!  I think I see themplaying around me.  The dear children!  How warmly have I beenattached to you, Charlotte!  Since the first hour I saw you, howimpossible have I found it to leave you.  This ribbon must beburied with me: it was a present from you on my birthday.  Howconfused it all appears!  Little did I then think that I shouldjourney this road.  But peace!  I pray you, peace!

íííí""They are loaded -- the clock strikes twelve.  I say amen.Charlotte, Charlotte! farewell, farewell!""

ííííA neighbour saw the flash, and heard the report of the pistol;but, as everything remained quiet, he thought no more of it.

ííííIn the morning, at six o'clock, the servant went into Werther'sroom with a candle.  He found his master stretched upon the floor,weltering in his blood, and the pistols at his side.  He called,he took him in his arms, but received no answer.  Life was not yetquite extinct.  The servant ran for a surgeon, and then went tofetch Albert.  Charlotte heard the ringing of the bell: a coldshudder seized her.  She wakened her husband, and they both rose.The servant, bathed in tears faltered forth the dreadful news.Charlotte fell senseless at Albert's feet.

ííííWhen the surgeon came to the unfortunate Werther, he was stilllying on the floor; and his pulse beat, but his limbs were cold.The bullet, entering the forehead, over the right eye, hadpenetrated the skull.  A vein was opened in his right arm: theblood came, and he still continued to breathe.

íííí>From the blood which flowed from the chair, it could be inferredthat he had committed the rash act sitting at his bureau, and thathe afterward fell upon the floor.  He was found lying on his backnear the window.  He was in full-dress costume.

ííííThe house, the neighbourhood, and the whole town were immediatelyin commotion.  Albert arrived.  They had laid Werther on the bed:his head was bound up, and the paleness of death was upon his face.His limbs were motionless; but he still breathed, at one timestrongly, then weaker -- his death was momently expected.

ííííHe had drunk only one glass of the wine.  ""Emilia Galotti"" layopen upon his bureau.

ííííI shall say nothing of Albert's distress, or of Charlotte's grief.

ííííThe old steward hastened to the house immediately upon hearing thenews: he embraced his dying friend amid a flood of tears.  Hiseldest boys soon followed him on foot.  In speechless sorrow theythrew themselves on their knees by the bedside, and kissed hishands and face.  The eldest, who was his favourite, hung over himtill he expired; and even then he was removed by force.  At twelveo'clock Werther breathed his last.  The presence of the steward,and the precautions he had adopted, prevented a disturbance; andthat night, at the hour of eleven, he caused the body to be interredin the place which Werther had selected for himself.

ííííThe steward and his sons followed the corpse to the grave.  Albertwas unable to accompany them.  Charlotte's life was despaired of.The body was carried by labourers.  No priest attended.

ííííEnd"
